      <title>Benchmarking Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control: Field Dataset and Behavior Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) interact with Traffic Control Devices (TCDs) is critical for assessing their influence on traffic operations, yet this interaction has received little focused empirical study. This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic. Our dataset is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>ReGlove: A Soft Pneumatic Glove for Activities of Daily Living Assistance via Wrist-Mounted Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ReGlove, a system that converts low-cost commercial pneumatic rehabilitation gloves into vision-guided assistive orthoses. Chronic upper-limb impairment affects millions worldwide, yet existing assistive technologies remain prohibitively expensive or rely on unreliable biological signals. Our platform integrates a wrist-mounted camera with an edge-computing inference engine (Raspberry Pi 5) to enable context-aware grasping without requiring reliable muscle signals. By adapting real-time YOLO-based computer vision models, the system achieves \SI{96.73}{\percent} grasp classification accuracy with sub-\SI{40.00}{\milli\second} end-to-end latency. Physical validation using standardized benchmarks shows \SI{82.71}{\percent} success on YCB object manipulation and reliable performance across \SI{27.00}{} Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks. With a total cost under \$\SI{250.00}{} and exclusively commercial components, ReGlove provides a technical foundation for accessible, vision-based upper-limb assistance that could benefit populations excluded from traditional EMG-controlled devices.</description>

      <title>WAM-Diff: A Masked Diffusion VLA Framework with MoE and Online Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation. The code for this paper will be released publicly at: https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/WAM-Diff</description>

      <title>Audio-Based Tactile Human-Robot Interaction Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of microphones placed on a robot's body to detect tactile interactions via sounds produced when the hard shell of the robot is touched. This approach is proposed as an alternative to traditional methods using joint torque sensors or 6-axis force/torque sensors. Two Adafruit I2S MEMS microphones integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4 were positioned on the torso of a Pollen Robotics Reachy robot to capture audio signals from various touch types on the robot arms (tapping, knocking, rubbing, stroking, scratching, and pressing). A convolutional neural network was trained for touch classification on a dataset of 336 pre-processed samples (48 samples per touch type). The model shows high classification accuracy between touch types with distinct acoustic dominant frequencies.</description>

      <title>Traversability Aware Autonomous Navigation for Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments requires robots to assess terrain difficulty in real-time and plan paths that balance efficiency with safety. This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost. This work establishes a foundation for intelligent terrain-aware navigation applicable to multi-modal robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>Enabling Autonomous Navigation in a Snake Robot through Visual-Inertial Odometry and Closed-Loop Trajectory Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snake robots offer exceptional mobility across extreme terrain inaccessible to conventional rovers, yet their highly articulated bodies present fundamental challenges for autonomous navigation in environments lacking external tracking infrastructure. This thesis develops a complete autonomy pipeline for COBRA, an 11 degree-of-freedom modular snake robot designed for planetary exploration. While the robot's biologically inspired serpentine gaits achieve impressive mobility, prior work has relied entirely on open-loop teleoperation. This approach integrates onboard visual-inertial SLAM, reduced-order state estimation, and closed-loop trajectory tracking to enable autonomous waypoint navigation. A depth camera paired with edge computing performs real-time localization during dynamic locomotion, validated against motion-capture ground truth to characterize drift behavior and failure modes unique to snake robot platforms. A reduced-order framework estimates Center-of-Mass pose, driving a closed-loop controller that modulates CPG gait parameters through distance-dependent yaw error blending. Physical experiments validate the complete system, demonstrating accurate multi-waypoint tracking and establishing foundations for autonomous snake robot navigation.</description>

      <title>VLSA: Vision-Language-Action Models with Plug-and-Play Safety Constraint Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generalizing across diverse robotic manipulation tasks. However, deploying these models in unstructured environments remains challenging due to the critical need for simultaneous task compliance and safety assurance, particularly in preventing potential collisions during physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a Vision-Language-Safe Action (VLSA) architecture, named AEGIS, which contains a plug-and-play safety constraint (SC) layer formulated via control barrier functions. AEGIS integrates directly with existing VLA models to improve safety with theoretical guarantees, while maintaining their original instruction-following performance. To evaluate the efficacy of our architecture, we construct a comprehensive safety-critical benchmark SafeLIBERO, spanning distinct manipulation scenarios characterized by varying degrees of spatial complexity and obstacle intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, AEGIS achieves a 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance rate while substantially increasing the task execution success rate by 17.25%. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we make our code, models, and the benchmark datasets publicly available at https://vlsa-aegis.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Interpretable Hybrid Robot Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study data-driven identification of interpretable hybrid robot dynamics, where an analytical rigid-body dynamics model is complemented by a learned residual torque term. Using symbolic regression and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), we recover compact closed-form expressions for this residual from joint-space data. In simulation on a 7-DoF Franka arm with known dynamics, these interpretable models accurately recover inertial, Coriolis, gravity, and viscous effects with very small relative error and outperform neural-network baselines in both accuracy and generalization. On real data from a 7-DoF WAM arm, symbolic-regression residuals generalize substantially better than SINDy and neural networks, which tend to overfit, and suggest candidate new closed-form formulations that extend the nominal dynamics model for this robot. Overall, the results indicate that interpretable residual dynamics models provide compact, accurate, and physically meaningful alternatives to black-box function approximators for torque prediction.</description>

      <title>Aion: Towards Hierarchical 4D Scene Graphs with Temporal Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments requires spatial representations that capture both semantic structure and temporal evolution. 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) provide hierarchical multi-resolution abstractions that encode geometry and semantics, but existing extensions toward dynamics largely focus on individual objects or agents. In parallel, Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) model typical motion patterns and temporal regularities, yet are usually tied to grid-based discretizations that lack semantic awareness and do not scale well to large environments. In this paper we introduce Aion, a framework that embeds temporal flow dynamics directly within a hierarchical 3DSG, effectively incorporating the temporal dimension. Aion employs a graph-based sparse MoD representation to capture motion flows over arbitrary time intervals and attaches them to navigational nodes in the scene graph, yielding more interpretable and scalable predictions that improve planning and interaction in complex dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Safe Learning for Contact-Rich Robot Tasks: A Survey from Classical Learning-Based Methods to Safe Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact-rich tasks pose significant challenges for robotic systems due to inherent uncertainty, complex dynamics, and the high risk of damage during interaction. Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments. More details and materials are available at our \href{ https://github.com/jack-sherman01/Awesome-Learning4Safe-Contact-rich-tasks}{Project GitHub Repository}.</description>

      <title>Towards Accessible Physical AI: LoRA-Based Fine-Tuning of VLA Models for Real-World Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation,enabling robots to execute natural language commands through end-to-end learning from visual observations.However, deploying large-scale VLA models on affordable robotic platforms remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for efficient adaptation to new robot embodiments. This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes. Our results show that with proper fine-tuning methodology, VLA models can be successfully deployed on affordable robotic platforms,making advanced manipulation capabilities accessible beyond expensive research robots.</description>

      <title>A Review of Learning-Based Motion Planning: Toward a Data-Driven Optimal Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning for high-level autonomous driving is constrained by a fundamental trade-off between the transparent, yet brittle, nature of pipeline methods and the adaptive, yet opaque, "black-box" characteristics of modern learning-based systems. This paper critically synthesizes the evolution of the field -- from pipeline methods through imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI -- to demonstrate how this persistent dilemma has hindered the development of truly trustworthy systems. To resolve this impasse, we conduct a comprehensive review of learning-based motion planning methods. Based on this review, we outline a data-driven optimal control paradigm as a unifying framework that synergistically integrates the verifiable structure of classical control with the adaptive capacity of machine learning, leveraging real-world data to continuously refine key components such as system dynamics, cost functions, and safety constraints. We explore this framework's potential to enable three critical next-generation capabilities: "Human-Centric" customization, "Platform-Adaptive" dynamics adaptation, and "System Self-Optimization" via self-tuning. We conclude by proposing future research directions based on this paradigm, aimed at developing intelligent transportation systems that are simultaneously safe, interpretable, and capable of human-like autonomy.</description>

      <title>Modified Hybrid A* Collision-Free Path-Planning for Automated Reverse Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parking a vehicle in tight spaces is a challenging task to perform due to the scarcity of feasible paths that are also collision-free. This paper presents a strategy to tackle this kind of maneuver with a modified Hybrid-A* path-planning algorithm that combines the feasibility guarantee inherent in the standard Hybrid A* algorithm with the addition of static obstacle collision avoidance. A kinematic single-track model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle, which is subsequently used as the motion model in the Hybrid A* path-planning algorithm to generate feasible motion primitive branches. The model states are also used to reconstruct the vehicle centerline, which, in conjunction with an inflated binary occupancy map, facilitates static obstacle collision avoidance functions. Simulation study and animation are set up to test the efficacy of the approach, and the proposed algorithm proves to consistently provide kinematically feasible trajectories that are also collision-free.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Approach to Terrain Maps for Safe Lunar Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safely landing on the lunar surface is a challenging task, especially in the heavily-shadowed South Pole region where traditional vision-based hazard detection methods are not reliable. The potential existence of valuable resources at the lunar South Pole has made landing in that region a high priority for many space agencies and commercial companies. However, relying on a LiDAR for hazard detection during descent is risky, as this technology is fairly untested in the lunar environment.
  There exists a rich log of lunar surface data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which could be used to create informative prior maps of the surface before descent. In this work, we propose a method for generating stochastic elevation maps from LRO data using Gaussian processes (GPs), which are a powerful Bayesian framework for non-parametric modeling that produce accompanying uncertainty estimates. In high-risk environments such as autonomous spaceflight, interpretable estimates of terrain uncertainty are critical. However, no previous approaches to stochastic elevation mapping have taken LRO Digital Elevation Model (DEM) confidence maps into account, despite this data containing key information about the quality of the DEM in different areas.
  To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage GP model in which a secondary GP learns spatially varying noise characteristics from DEM confidence data. This heteroscedastic information is then used to inform the noise parameters for the primary GP, which models the lunar terrain. Additionally, we use stochastic variational GPs to enable scalable training. By leveraging GPs, we are able to more accurately model the impact of heteroscedastic sensor noise on the resulting elevation map. As a result, our method produces more informative terrain uncertainty, which can be used for downstream tasks such as hazard detection and safe landing site selection.</description>

      <title>B-ActiveSEAL: Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Active Exploration with Tightly Coupled Localization-Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active robot exploration requires decision-making processes that integrate localization and mapping under tightly coupled uncertainty. However, managing these interdependent uncertainties over long-term operations in large-scale environments rapidly becomes computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we propose B-ActiveSEAL, a scalable information-theoretic active exploration framework that explicitly accounts for coupled uncertainties-from perception through mapping-into the decision-making process. Our framework (i) adaptively balances map uncertainty (exploration) and localization uncertainty (exploitation), (ii) accommodates a broad class of generalized entropy measures, enabling flexible and uncertainty-aware active exploration, and (iii) establishes Behavioral entropy (BE) as an effective information measure for active exploration by enabling intuitive and adaptive decision-making under coupled uncertainties. We establish a theoretical foundation for propagating coupled uncertainties and integrating them into general entropy formulations, enabling uncertainty-aware active exploration under tightly coupled localization-mapping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on open-source maps and ROS-Unity simulations across diverse and complex environments. The results demonstrate that B-ActiveSEAL achieves a well-balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off and produces diverse, adaptive exploration behaviors across environments, highlighting clear advantages over representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Navigation Around Unknown Space Objects Using Visible-Thermal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the popularity of on-orbit operations grows, so does the need for precise navigation around unknown resident space objects (RSOs) such as other spacecraft, orbital debris, and asteroids. The use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms is often studied as a method to map out the surface of an RSO and find the inspector's relative pose using a lidar or conventional camera. However, conventional cameras struggle during eclipse or shadowed periods, and lidar, though robust to lighting conditions, tends to be heavier, bulkier, and more power-intensive. Thermal-infrared cameras can track the target RSO throughout difficult illumination conditions without these limitations. While useful, thermal-infrared imagery lacks the resolution and feature-richness of visible cameras. In this work, images of a target satellite in low Earth orbit are photo-realistically simulated in both visible and thermal-infrared bands. Pixel-level fusion methods are used to create visible/thermal-infrared composites that leverage the best aspects of each camera. Navigation errors from a monocular SLAM algorithm are compared between visible, thermal-infrared, and fused imagery in various lighting and trajectories. Fused imagery yields substantially improved navigation performance over visible-only and thermal-only methods.</description>

      <title>Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.</description>

      <title>Semantic Zone based 3D Map Management for Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots in large-scale indoor environments, such as hospitals and logistics centers, require accurate 3D spatial representations. However, 3D maps consume substantial memory, making it difficult to maintain complete map data within limited computational resources. Existing SLAM frameworks typically rely on geometric distance or temporal metrics for memory management, often resulting in inefficient data retrieval in spatially compartmentalized environments. To address this, we propose a semantic zone-based 3D map management method that shifts the paradigm from geometry-centric to semantics-centric control. Our approach partitions the environment into meaningful spatial units (e.g., lobbies, hallways) and designates these zones as the primary unit for memory management. By dynamically loading only task-relevant zones into Working Memory (WM) and offloading inactive zones to Long-Term Memory (LTM), the system strictly enforces user-defined memory thresholds. Implemented within the RTAB-Map framework, our method demonstrates substantial reductions in unnecessary signature load/unload cycles and cumulative memory utilization compared to standard approaches. The results confirm that semantic zone-based management ensures stable, predictable memory usage while preserving map availability for navigation.

      <title>Learning to Get Up Across Morphologies: Zero-Shot Recovery with a Unified Humanoid Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fall recovery is a critical skill for humanoid robots in dynamic environments such as RoboCup, where prolonged downtime often decides the match. Recent techniques using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have produced robust get-up behaviors, yet existing methods require training of separate policies for each robot morphology. This paper presents a single DRL policy capable of recovering from falls across seven humanoid robots with diverse heights (0.48 - 0.81 m), weights (2.8 - 7.9 kg), and dynamics. Trained with CrossQ, the unified policy transfers zero-shot up to 86 +/- 7% (95% CI [81, 89]) on unseen morphologies, eliminating the need for robot-specific training. Comprehensive leave-one-out experiments, morph scaling analysis, and diversity ablations show that targeted morphological coverage improves zero-shot generalization. In some cases, the shared policy even surpasses the specialist baselines. These findings illustrate the practicality of morphology-agnostic control for fall recovery, laying the foundation for generalist humanoid control.

      <title>Robust Underwater Localization of Buoyancy Driven microFloats Using Acoustic Time-of-Flight Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate underwater localization remains a challenge for inexpensive autonomous platforms that require highfrequency position updates. In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost localization pipeline for buoyancy-driven microFloats operating in coastal waters. We build upon previous work by introducing a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) localization framework, which incorporates both float-to-buoy and buoy-to-float transmissions, thereby increasing the number of usable measurements. The method integrates nonlinear trilateration with a filtering of computed position estimates based on geometric cost and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB). This approach removes outliers caused by multipath effects and other acoustic errors from the ToF estimation and improves localization robustness without relying on heavy smoothing. We validate the framework in two field deployments in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The localization pipeline achieves median positioning errors below 4 m relative to GPS positions. The filtering technique shows a reduction in mean error from 139.29 m to 12.07 m, and improved alignment of trajectories with GPS paths. Additionally, we demonstrate a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) localization for unrecovered floats that were transmitting during the experiment. Range-based acoustic localization techniques are widely used and generally agnostic to hardware-this work aims to maximize their utility by improving positioning frequency and robustness through careful algorithmic design.</description>

      <title>CAR-CHASE: Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots, addressed by algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CL-CBS), faces significant computational challenges due to expensive kinematic heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in CBS where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\% and 50\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out. Performance gains scale with problem complexity, reaching up to 4.06$\times$ speedup for challenging 30-agent obstacle scenarios. Our techniques are general and applicable to other CBS variants.</description>

      <title>Programmable Deformation Design of Porous Soft Actuator through Volumetric-Pattern-Induced Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional soft pneumatic actuators, typically based on hollow elastomeric chambers, often suffer from small structural support and require costly geometry-specific redesigns for multimodal functionality. Porous materials such as foam, filled into chambers, can provide structural stability for the actuators. However, methods to achieve programmable deformation by tailoring the porous body itself remain underexplored. In this paper, a novel design method is presented to realize soft porous actuators with programmable deformation by incising specific patterns into the porous foam body. This approach introduces localized structural anisotropy of the foam guiding the material's deformation under a global vacuum input. Furthermore, three fundamental patterns on a cylindrical foam substrate are discussed: transverse for bending, longitudinal for tilting, and diagonal for twisting. A computational model is built with Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to investigate the mechanism of the incision-patterning method. Experiments demonstrate that with a potential optimal design of the pattern array number N, actuators can achieve bending up to $80^{\circ}$ (N=2), tilting of $18^{\circ}$ (N=1), and twisting of $115^{\circ}$ (N=8). The versatility of our approach is demonstrated via pattern transferability, scalability, and mold-less rapid prototyping of complex designs. As a comprehensive application, we translate the human hand crease map into a functional incision pattern, creating a bio-inspired soft robot hand capable of human-like adaptive grasping. Our work provides a new, efficient, and scalable paradigm for the design of multi-functional soft porous robots.</description>

      <title>INDOOR-LiDAR: Bridging Simulation and Reality for Robot-Centric 360 degree Indoor LiDAR Perception -- A Robot-Centric Hybrid Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present INDOOR-LIDAR, a comprehensive hybrid dataset of indoor 3D LiDAR point clouds designed to advance research in robot perception. Existing indoor LiDAR datasets often suffer from limited scale, inconsistent annotation formats, and human-induced variability during data collection. INDOOR-LIDAR addresses these limitations by integrating simulated environments with real-world scans acquired using autonomous ground robots, providing consistent coverage and realistic sensor behavior under controlled variations. Each sample consists of dense point cloud data enriched with intensity measurements and KITTI-style annotations. The annotation schema encompasses common indoor object categories within various scenes. The simulated subset enables flexible configuration of layouts, point densities, and occlusions, while the real-world subset captures authentic sensor noise, clutter, and domain-specific artifacts characteristic of real indoor settings. INDOOR-LIDAR supports a wide range of applications including 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception, SLAM, semantic scene understanding, and domain adaptation between simulated and real indoor domains. By bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data, INDOOR-LIDAR establishes a scalable, realistic, and reproducible benchmark for advancing robotic perception in complex indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Unifying Quadrotor Motion Planning and Control by Chaining Different Fidelity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many aerial tasks involving quadrotors demand both instant reactivity and long-horizon planning. High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules.</description>

Abstract: This thesis work presents a more efficient and effective approach to training control-related tasks for humanoid robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The traditional RL methods are limited in adapting to real-world environments, complexity, and natural motions, but the proposed approach overcomes these limitations by using curriculum training and Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) technique. The results show that the developed RL policies for kicking, walking, and jumping are more dynamic, and adaptive, and outperformed previous methods. However, the transfer of the learned policy from simulation to the real world was unsuccessful, highlighting the limitations of current RL methods in fully adapting to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Autonomously Unweaving Multiple Cables Using Visual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cable management tasks involve separating out the different cables and removing tangles. Automating this task is challenging because cables are deformable and can have combinations of knots and multiple interwoven segments. Prior works have focused on untying knots in one cable, which is one subtask of cable management. However, in this paper, we focus on a different subtask called multi-cable unweaving, which refers to removing the intersections among multiple interwoven cables to separate them and facilitate further manipulation. We propose a method that utilizes visual feedback to unweave a bundle of loosely entangled cables. We formulate cable unweaving as a pick-and-place problem, where the grasp position is selected from discrete nodes in a graph-based cable state representation. Our cable state representation encodes both topological and geometric information about the cables from the visual image. To predict future cable states and identify valid actions, we present a novel state transition model that takes into account the straightening and bending of cables during manipulation. Using this state transition model, we select between two high-level action primitives and calculate predicted immediate costs to optimize the lower-level actions. We experimentally demonstrate that iterating the above perception-planning-action process enables unweaving electric cables and shoelaces with an 84% success rate on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) poses unprecedented traffic coordination challenges, especially with increasing UAV densities in dense urban corridors. This paper introduces a mathematical model using a control algorithm to optimize an Edge AI-driven decentralized swarm architecture for intelligent conflict resolution, enabling real-time decision-making with low latency. Using lightweight neural networks, the system leverages edge nodes to perform distributed conflict detection and resolution. A simulation platform was developed to evaluate the scheme under various UAV densities. Results indicate that the conflict resolution time is dramatically minimized up to 3.8 times faster, and accuracy is enhanced compared to traditional centralized control models. The proposed architecture is highly promising for scalable, efficient, and safe aerial traffic management in future UAM systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Parameter Tuning Framework for a Lyapunov Based Path Following Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter tuning in real-world experiments is constrained by the limited evaluation budget available on hardware. The path-following controller studied in this paper reflects a typical situation in nonlinear geometric controller, where multiple gains influence the dynamics through coupled nonlinear terms. Such interdependence makes manual tuning inefficient and unlikely to yield satisfactory performance within a practical number of trials. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that treats the closed-loop system as a black box and selects controller gains using a Gaussian-process surrogate. BO offers model-free exploration, quantified uncertainty, and data-efficient search, making it well suited for tuning tasks where each evaluation is costly. The framework is implemented on Honda's AI-Formula three-wheeled robot and assessed through repeated full-lap experiments on a fixed test track. The results show that BO improves controller performance within 32 trials, including 15 warm-start initial evaluations, indicating that it can efficiently locate high-performing regions of the parameter space under real-world conditions. These findings demonstrate that BO provides a practical, reliable, and data-efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers on real robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>HMPCC: Human-Aware Model Predictive Coverage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of coordinating a team of robots to cover an unknown environment while ensuring safe operation and avoiding collisions with non-cooperative agents. Traditional coverage strategies often rely on simplified assumptions, such as known or convex environments and static density functions, and struggle to adapt to real-world scenarios, especially when humans are involved. In this work, we propose a human-aware coverage framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), namely HMPCC, where human motion predictions are integrated into the planning process. By anticipating human trajectories within the MPC horizon, robots can proactively coordinate their actions %avoid redundant exploration, and adapt to dynamic conditions. The environment is modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), representing regions of interest. Team members operate in a fully decentralized manner, without relying on explicit communication, an essential feature in hostile or communication-limited scenarios. Our results show that human trajectory forecasting enables more efficient and adaptive coverage, improving coordination between human and robotic agents.</description>

      <title>VLG-Loc: Vision-Language Global Localization from Labeled Footprint Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Vision-Language Global Localization (VLG-Loc), a novel global localization method that uses human-readable labeled footprint maps containing only names and areas of distinctive visual landmarks in an environment. While humans naturally localize themselves using such maps, translating this capability to robotic systems remains highly challenging due to the difficulty of establishing correspondences between observed landmarks and those in the map without geometric and appearance details. To address this challenge, VLG-Loc leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to search the robot's multi-directional image observations for the landmarks noted in the map. The method then identifies robot poses within a Monte Carlo localization framework, where the found landmarks are used to evaluate the likelihood of each pose hypothesis. Experimental validation in simulated and real-world retail environments demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing scan-based methods, particularly under environmental changes. Further improvements are achieved through the probabilistic fusion of visual and scan-based localization.</description>

      <title>SAGA: Open-World Mobile Manipulation via Structured Affordance Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAGA, a versatile and adaptive framework for visuomotor control that can generalize across various environments, task objectives, and user specifications. To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks. SAGA consistently outperforms end-to-end and modular baselines by substantial margins. Together, these results demonstrate that structured affordance grounding offers a scalable and effective pathway toward generalist mobile manipulation.</description>

      <title>MPC-Guided Safe Reinforcement Learning and Lipschitz-Based Filtering for Structured Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern engineering systems, such as autonomous vehicles, flexible robotics, and intelligent aerospace platforms, require controllers that are robust to uncertainties, adaptive to environmental changes, and safety-aware under real-time constraints. RL offers powerful data-driven adaptability for systems with nonlinear dynamics that interact with uncertain environments. RL, however, lacks built-in mechanisms for dynamic constraint satisfaction during exploration. MPC offers structured constraint handling and robustness, but its reliance on accurate models and computationally demanding online optimization may pose significant challenges. This paper proposes an integrated MPC-RL framework that combines stability and safety guarantees of MPC with the adaptability of RL. During training, MPC defines safe control bounds that guide the RL component and that enable constraint-aware policy learning. At deployment, the learned policy operates in real time with a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to ensure constraint satisfaction without heavy online optimizations. The approach, which is validated on a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, demonstrates improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence. The architecture generalizes to other domains with structured nonlinearities and bounded disturbances, offering a scalable solution for safe artificial-intelligence-driven control in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>SLIM-VDB: A Real-Time 3D Probabilistic Semantic Mapping Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SLIM-VDB, a new lightweight semantic mapping system with probabilistic semantic fusion for closed-set or open-set dictionaries. Advances in data structures from the computer graphics community, such as OpenVDB, have demonstrated significantly improved computational and memory efficiency in volumetric scene representation. Although OpenVDB has been used for geometric mapping in robotics applications, semantic mapping for scene understanding with OpenVDB remains unexplored. In addition, existing semantic mapping systems lack support for integrating both fixed-category and open-language label predictions within a single framework. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D semantic mapping system that leverages the OpenVDB data structure and integrates a unified Bayesian update framework for both closed- and open-set semantic fusion. Our proposed framework, SLIM-VDB, achieves significant reduction in both memory and integration times compared to current state-of-the-art semantic mapping approaches, while maintaining comparable mapping accuracy. An open-source C++ codebase with a Python interface is available at https://github.com/umfieldrobotics/slim-vdb.</description>

      <title>Tackling Snow-Induced Challenges: Safe Autonomous Lane-Keeping with Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two new algorithms for the lane keeping system (LKS) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating under snowy road conditions. These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs.</description>

      <title>Learning Terrain Aware Bipedal Locomotion via Reduced Dimensional Perceptual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a hierarchical strategy for terrain-aware bipedal locomotion that integrates reduced-dimensional perceptual representations to enhance reinforcement learning (RL)-based high-level (HL) policies for real-time gait generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, our framework leverages latent terrain encodings via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) alongside reduced-order robot dynamics, optimizing the locomotion decision process with a compact state. We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data. We further validate our framework using the high-fidelity Agility Robotics (AR) simulator, incorporating realistic sensor noise, state estimation, and actuator dynamics. The results confirm the robustness and adaptability of our method, underscoring its potential for hardware deployment.</description>

      <title>K-VARK: Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman Filter for Sensorless Force Estimation in Collaborative Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of contact forces is crucial for ensuring safe and precise interaction of robots with unstructured environments. However, accurate sensorless force estimation remains challenging due to inherent modeling errors and complex residual dynamics and friction. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances. Experimental validation on a 6-DoF collaborative manipulator demonstrates that K-VARK achieves over 20% reduction in RMSE compared to state-of-the-art sensorless force estimation methods, yielding robust and accurate external force/torque estimation suitable for advanced tasks such as polishing and assembly.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining through Visual-Physical Alignment from Human Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide a promising paradigm for robot learning by integrating visual perception with language-guided policy learning. However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Motion Planning from Vision and Language using Heat-Inspired Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for robot motion planning by capturing the multi-modal distribution of feasible trajectories. However, their extension to multi-robot settings with flexible, language-conditioned task specifications remains limited. Furthermore, current diffusion-based approaches incur high computational cost during inference and struggle with generalization because they require explicit construction of environment representations and lack mechanisms for reasoning about geometric reachability. To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace. This naturally handles out-of-distribution scenarios -- in terms of reachability -- by guiding robots toward accessible alternatives that match the semantic intent, while eliminating the need for explicit obstacle information at inference time. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world-inspired maps, along with real-robot experiments, show that LCHD consistently outperforms prior diffusion-based planners in success rate, while reducing planning latency.</description>

      <title>PvP: Data-Efficient Humanoid Robot Learning with Proprioceptive-Privileged Contrastive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving efficient and robust whole-body control (WBC) is essential for enabling humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in this domain, its sample inefficiency remains a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics and partial observability of humanoid robots. To address this limitation, we propose PvP, a Proprioceptive-Privileged contrastive learning framework that leverages the intrinsic complementarity between proprioceptive and privileged states. PvP learns compact and task-relevant latent representations without requiring hand-crafted data augmentations, enabling faster and more stable policy learning. To support systematic evaluation, we develop SRL4Humanoid, the first unified and modular framework that provides high-quality implementations of representative state representation learning (SRL) methods for humanoid robot learning. Extensive experiments on the LimX Oli robot across velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks demonstrate that PvP significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance compared to baseline SRL methods. Our study further provides practical insights into integrating SRL with RL for humanoid WBC, offering valuable guidance for data-efficient humanoid robot learning.</description>

      <title>Sequence of Expert: Boosting Imitation Planners for Autonomous Driving through Temporal Alternation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has emerged as a central paradigm in autonomous driving. While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.</description>

      <title>OXE-AugE: A Large-Scale Robot Augmentation of OXE for Scaling Cross-Embodiment Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large and diverse datasets are needed for training generalist robot policies that have potential to control a variety of robot embodiments -- robot arm and gripper combinations -- across diverse tasks and environments. As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $\pi_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

      <title>START: Traversing Sparse Footholds with Terrain Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traversing terrains with sparse footholds like legged animals presents a promising yet challenging task for quadruped robots, as it requires precise environmental perception and agile control to secure safe foot placement while maintaining dynamic stability. Model-based hierarchical controllers excel in laboratory settings, but suffer from limited generalization and overly conservative behaviors. End-to-end learning-based approaches unlock greater flexibility and adaptability, but existing state-of-the-art methods either rely on heightmaps that introduce noise and complex, costly pipelines, or implicitly infer terrain features from egocentric depth images, often missing accurate critical geometric cues and leading to inefficient learning and rigid gaits. To overcome these limitations, we propose START, a single-stage learning framework that enables agile, stable locomotion on highly sparse and randomized footholds. START leverages only low-cost onboard vision and proprioception to accurately reconstruct local terrain heightmap, providing an explicit intermediate representation to convey essential features relevant to sparse foothold regions.

      <title>Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Smooth Paths with Curvature Guarantees by Mollification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most path following and trajectory tracking algorithms in mobile robotics require the desired path or trajectory to be defined by at least twice continuously differentiable functions to guarantee key properties such as global convergence, especially for nonholonomic robots like unicycles with speed constraints. Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms.</description>

      <title>ALBATROSS: A robotised system for high-throughput electrolyte screening via automated electrolyte formulation, coin-cell fabrication, and electrochemical evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As battery technologies advance toward higher stability and energy density, the need for extensive cell-level testing across various component configurations becomes critical. To evaluate performance and understand the operating principles of batteries in laboratory scale, fabrication and evaluation of coin cells are essential processes. However, the conventional coin-cell assembly and testing processes require significant time and labor from researchers, posing challenges to high-throughput screening research. In this study, we introduce an Automated Li-ion BAttery Testing RObot SyStem (ALBATROSS), an automated system capable of electrolyte formulation, coin-cell assembly, and electrochemical evaluation. The system, integrated within a argon-filled glovebox, enables fully automated assembly and testing of up to 48 cells without researcher intervention. By incorporating custom-designed robot gripper and 3D-printed structures optimized for precise cell handling, ALBATROSS achieved high assembly reliability, yielding a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 1.2% in discharge capacity and a standard deviation of less than 3 {\Omega} in EIS measurements for NCM811||Li half cells. Owing to its high reliability and automation capability, ALBATROSS allows for the acquisition of high-quality coin-cell datasets, which are expected to accelerate the development of next-generation electrolytes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the deformation of flexible objects is challenging due to their non-linear dynamics and high-dimensional configuration space. This work presents a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator targeted at control applications. We exploit the differentiability of the simulator to optimize a control trajectory in an active damping problem for a hyperelastic rope. The simulator effectively minimizes the kinetic energy of the rope around 2$\times$ faster than a baseline MPPI method and to a 20% lower energy level, while using about 3% of the computation time.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional Safe Rectangle Corridor-Based MPC for Nonholonomic Robots Navigation in Cluttered Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become indispensable in industrial applications due to their operational flexibility and efficiency. Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms).</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Automated Assembly Sequence and Production Line Planning using Graph-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents PyCAALP (Python-based Computer-Aided Assembly Line Planning), a framework for automated Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) and Production Line Planning (PLP), employing a graph-based approach to model components and joints within production modules. The framework integrates kinematic boundary conditions, such as potential part collisions, to guarantee the feasibility of automated assembly planning. The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies. The PLP stage is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), balancing the total times of a fixed number of manufacturing stations. While some complexity reduction techniques may sacrifice optimality, they significantly reduce the MIPs computational time. Furthermore, the framework enables customization of engineering constraints and supports a flexible trade-off between ASP and PLP. The open-source nature of the framework, available at https://github.com/TUM-utg/PyCAALP, promotes further collaboration and adoption in both industrial and production research applications.</description>

      <title>Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Generative Agent Behavior Models for Interactive Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning interactive motion behaviors among multiple agents is a core challenge in autonomous driving. While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies. Demo videos are available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Dynamic Modeling of Cable-Driven Continuum Robots Based on Actuation-Space Energy Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) require accurate, real-time dynamic models for high-speed dynamics prediction or model-based control, making such capability an urgent need. In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Actuation-Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for CDCRs, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space to enable lightweight yet accurate dynamic modeling. Through a unified variational derivation, the governing dynamics reduce to a single partial differential equation (PDE), requiring only the Euler moment balance while implicitly incorporating the Newton force balance. By also avoiding explicit computation of cable-backbone contact forces, the formulation simplifies the model structure and improves computational efficiency while preserving geometric accuracy and physical consistency. Importantly, the proposed framework for dynamic modeling natively supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes, a capability seldom achieved in existing dynamic formulations. Leveraging this lightweight structure, a Galerkin space-time modal discretization with analytical time-domain derivatives of the reduced state further enables an average 62.3% computational speedup over state-of-the-art real-time dynamic modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic-Motivation Multi-Robot Social Formation Navigation with Coordinated Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13293v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to multi-robot social formation navigation, a critical capability for enabling seamless human-robot coexistence. While RL offers a promising paradigm, the inherent unpredictability and often uncooperative dynamics of pedestrian behavior pose substantial challenges, particularly concerning the efficiency of coordinated exploration among robots. To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates. Empirical results on social formation navigation benchmarks demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across crucial metrics. Our code and video demos are available at: https://github.com/czxhunzi/CEMRRL.</description>

      <title>Humanoid Robot Running Through Random Stepping Stones and Jumping Over Obstacles: Step Adaptation Using Spring-Mass Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a step adaptation framework for running through spring-mass trajectories and deadbeat control gain libraries. It includes four main parts: (1) Automatic spring-mass trajectory library generation; (2) Deadbeat control gain library generation through an actively controlled template model that resembles the whole-body dynamics well; (3) Trajectory selection policy development for step adaptation; (4) Mapping spring-mass trajectories to a humanoid model through a whole-body control (WBC) framework also accounting for closed-kinematic chain systems, self collisions, and reactive limb swinging. We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.</description>

      <title>Control of a Twin Rotor using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for controlling and stabilizing the Twin Rotor Aerodynamic System (TRAS) at specific pitch and azimuth angles and tracking a given trajectory. The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms. However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Policy Learning for 6-DOF Position Control of Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) require reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position control to operate effectively in complex and dynamic marine environments. Traditional controllers are effective under nominal conditions but exhibit degraded performance when faced with unmodeled dynamics or environmental disturbances. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful alternative but training is typically slow and sim-to-real transfer remains challenging. This work introduces a GPU-accelerated RL training pipeline built in JAX and MuJoCo-XLA (MJX). By jointly JIT-compiling large-scale parallel physics simulation and learning updates, we achieve training times of under two minutes.Through systematic evaluation of multiple RL algorithms, we show robust 6-DOF trajectory tracking and effective disturbance rejection in real underwater experiments, with policies transferred zero-shot from simulation. Our results provide the first explicit real-world demonstration of RL-based AUV position control across all six degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Universal Dexterous Functional Grasping via Demonstration-Editing Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in dexterous grasping, significantly improving grasp performance and generalization from simulation to the real world. However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy. In addition to strong sim-to-real capability, by incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) for planning, our system achieves autonomous instruction-following grasp execution.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Navigation Capabilities of a Modified COAST Guidewire Robot in an Anatomical Phantom Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issues that arise due to the manual navigation of guidewires in endovascular interventions, research in medical robotics has taken a strong interest in developing robotically steerable guidewires, which offer the possibility of enhanced maneuverability and navigation, as the tip of the guidewire can be actively steered. The COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot has the ability to generate a wide variety of motions including bending motion with different bending lengths, follow-the-leader motion, and feedforward motion. In our past studies, we have explored different designs of the COAST guidewire robot and developed modeling, control, and sensing strategies for the COAST guidewire robot. In this study, the performance of a modified COAST guidewire robot is evaluated by conducting navigation experiments in an anatomical phantom model with pulsatile flow. The modified COAST guidewire robot is a simplified version of the COAST guidewire robot and consists of two tubes as opposed to three tubes. Through this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified COAST guidewire robot in navigating the tortuous phantom vasculature.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning based 6-DoF Maneuvers for Microgravity Intravehicular Docking: A Simulation Study with Int-Ball2 in ISS-JEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous free-flyers play a critical role in intravehicular tasks aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where their precise docking under sensing noise, small actuation mismatches, and environmental variability remains a nontrivial challenge. This work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) docking of JAXA's Int-Ball2 robot inside a high-fidelity Isaac Sim model of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we train and evaluate controllers under domain-randomized dynamics and bounded observation noise, while explicitly modeling propeller drag-torque effects and polarity structure. This enables a controlled study of how Int-Ball2's propulsion physics influence RL-based docking performance in constrained microgravity interiors. The learned policy achieves stable and reliable docking across varied conditions and lays the groundwork for future extensions pertaining to Int-Ball2 in collision-aware navigation, safe RL, propulsion-accurate sim-to-real transfer, and vision-based end-to-end docking.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Perception for Safety Enhancement of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Manufacturing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>World Models Can Leverage Human Videos for Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is challenging because it requires understanding how subtle hand motion influences the environment through contact with objects. We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.</description>

      <title>RoboTracer: Mastering Spatial Trace with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.</description>

      <title>NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

      <title>Car-following Models and Congestion Control with Followerstopper on a Ring-Road under Known Delay -- Examining Limit Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the IDM microscopic car-following model from a dynamical systems perspective, analyzing the effects of delay on congestion formation. Further, a case of mixed-autonomy is considered by controlling one car with Followerstopper in a ring road setting containing IDM vehicles as human drivers. Specifically, the stop-and-go waves phenomenon in idealized traffic from a dynamical systems perspective is examined. We show that Followerstopper-controlled vehicle is effective at eliminating emergent stop-and-go waves in the IDM traffic simulation. We show through simulation that the uniform flow manifold is unstable for the ring road simulation with IDM vehicles, and that replacing a single car with Followerstopper induces stability, allowing the cars to drive safely at a uniform speed. Additionally, the case of known delay is considered in a mixed-autonomy scenario. Our simulation result shows that while considering a known time delay, traffic waves emerge earlier than in the no-delay case. At the same time, a single-vehicle controlled using Followerstopper controller is able to prevent the emergence of traffic waves even in the presence of delay.</description>

      <title>Explainable Adversarial-Robust Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart farming has emerged as a key technology for advancing modern agriculture through automation and intelligent control. However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Lagrange Control for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method for nonlinear control systems to ensure the safety and stability through Taylor's theorem with Lagrange remainder. To achieve this, we expand a safety or stability function with respect to time along the system dynamics using the Lie derivative and Taylor's theorem. This expansion enables the control input to appear in the Taylor series at an order equivalent to the relative degree of the function. We show that the proposed TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for system safety and is applicable to systems and constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The TLC exhibits connections with existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) methods, and it further extends the CBF and CLF methods to the complex domain, especially for higher order cases. Compared to High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), TLC is less restrictive as it does not require forward invariance of the intersection of a set of safe sets while HOCBFs do. We employ TLC to reformulate a constrained optimal control problem as a sequence of quadratic programs with a zero-order hold implementation method, and demonstrate the safety of zero-order hold TLC using an event-triggered control method to address inter-sampling effects. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TLC method through an adaptive cruise control system and a robot control problem, and compare it with existing CBF methods.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Drive: Democratizing Long-Tail Data Curation via Open-Vocabulary Grounding and Neuro-Symbolic VLM Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12012v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.</description>

      <title>Goal Reaching with Eikonal-Constrained Hierarchical Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) mitigates the difficulty of reward design by framing tasks as goal reaching rather than maximizing hand-crafted reward signals. In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition. Empirically, Eik-HiQRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline goal-conditioned navigation and yields consistent gains over QRL in manipulation tasks, matching temporal-difference methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Children with Autism During NAO Robot-Mediated Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding emotional responses in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during social interaction remains a critical challenge in both developmental psychology and human-robot interaction. This study presents a novel deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition in autistic children in response to a name-calling event by a humanoid robot (NAO), under controlled experimental settings. The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks. Emotions were probabilistically labeled using a weighted ensemble of two models: DeepFace's and FER, each contributing to soft-label generation across seven emotion classes. Final classification leveraged a fused embedding optimized via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in modeling subtle affective responses and offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, as the pipeline effectively captures micro emotional cues in neurodivergent children, addressing a major gap in autism-specific HRI research. This work represents the first such large-scale, real-world dataset and pipeline from India on autism-focused emotion analysis using social robotics, contributing an essential foundation for future personalized assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>From Human Intention to Action Prediction: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Intention-driven End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.</description>

      <title>D3D-VLP: Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model for Embodied Grounding and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied agents face a critical dilemma that end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning, while modular systems ignore cross-component interdependencies and synergies. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model (D3D-VLP). Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset with 10M hybrid samples from 5K real scans and 20K synthetic scenes that are compatible with online learning methods such as RL and DAgger. Our D3D-VLP achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation (SG3D). Real-world mobile manipulation experiments further validate the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>High Order Control Lyapunov Function - Control Barrier Function - Quadratic Programming Based Autonomous Driving Controller for Bicyclist Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge in the development of advanced autonomous driving systems in smart cities. Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Cross-Level Sensor Fusion with Object Lists via Transformer for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.</description>

      <title>SignRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented System for Scalable Zero-Shot Road Sign Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.</description>

      <title>Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>MMDrive: Interactive Scene Understanding Beyond Vision with Multi-representational Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13177v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.</description>

      <title>MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13636v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Interpretability and Interactivity in Robot Manipulation: A Neurosymbolic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a neurosymbolic architecture for coupling language-guided visual reasoning with robot manipulation. A non-expert human user can prompt the robot using unconstrained natural language, providing a referring expression (REF), a question (VQA), or a grasp action instruction. The system tackles all cases in a task-agnostic fashion through the utilization of a shared library of primitive skills. Each primitive handles an independent sub-task, such as reasoning about visual attributes, spatial relation comprehension, logic and enumeration, as well as arm control. A language parser maps the input query to an executable program composed of such primitives, depending on the context. While some primitives are purely symbolic operations (e.g. counting), others are trainable neural functions (e.g. visual grounding), therefore marrying the interpretability and systematic generalization benefits of discrete symbolic approaches with the scalability and representational power of deep networks. We generate a 3D vision-and-language synthetic dataset of tabletop scenes in a simulation environment to train our approach and perform extensive evaluations in both synthetic and real-world scenes. Results showcase the benefits of our approach in terms of accuracy, sample-efficiency, and robustness to the user's vocabulary, while being transferable to real-world scenes with few-shot visual fine-tuning. Finally, we integrate our method with a robot framework and demonstrate how it can serve as an interpretable solution for an interactive object-picking task, achieving an average success rate of 80.2\%, both in simulation and with a real robot. We make supplementary material available in https://gtziafas.github.io/neurosymbolic-manipulation.</description>

      <title>STITCHER: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Motion Primitive Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy constraints. Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</description>

Abstract: Learning robust and generalizable world models is crucial for enabling efficient and scalable robotic control in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>CT-UIO: Continuous-Time UWB-Inertial-Odometer Localization Using Non-Uniform B-spline with Fewer Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) based positioning with fewer anchors has attracted significant research interest in recent years, especially under energy-constrained conditions. However, most existing methods rely on discrete-time representations and smoothness priors to infer a robot's motion states, which often struggle with ensuring multi-sensor data synchronization. In this article, we present a continuous-time UWB-Inertial-Odometer localization system (CT-UIO), utilizing a non-uniform B-spline framework with fewer anchors. Unlike traditional uniform B-spline-based continuous-time methods, we introduce an adaptive knot-span adjustment strategy for non-uniform continuous-time trajectory representation. This is accomplished by adjusting control points dynamically based on movement speed. To enable efficient fusion of {inertial measurement unit (IMU) and odometer data, we propose an improved extended Kalman filter (EKF) with innovation-based adaptive estimation to provide short-term accurate motion prior. Furthermore, to address the challenge of achieving a fully observable UWB localization system under few-anchor conditions, the virtual anchor (VA) generation method based on multiple hypotheses is proposed. At the backend, we propose an adaptive sliding window strategy for global trajectory estimation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three self-collected datasets with different UWB anchor numbers and motion modes. The result shows that the proposed CT-UIO achieves 0.403m, 0.150m, and 0.189m localization accuracy in corridor, exhibition hall, and office environments, yielding 17.2%, 26.1%, and 15.2% improvements compared with competing state-of-the-art UIO systems, respectively. The codebase and datasets of this work will be open-sourced at https://github.com/JasonSun623/CT-UIO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are experts in physical collaboration by leveraging cognitive abilities such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making to regulate compliance behaviors based on their partners' states and task requirements. Equipping robots with similar cognitive-inspired collaboration skills can significantly enhance the efficiency and adaptability of human-robot collaboration (HRC). This paper introduces an innovative HumanInspired Impedance Regulation Skill Learning framework (HIImpRSL) for robotic systems to achieve leader-follower and mutual adaptation in multiple physical collaborative tasks. The proposed framework enables the robot to adapt its compliance based on human states and reference trajectories derived from human-human demonstrations. By integrating electromyography (EMG) signals and motion data, we extract endpoint impedance profiles and reference trajectories to construct a joint representation via imitation learning. An LSTM-based module then learns task-oriented impedance regulation policies, which are implemented through a whole-body impedance controller for online impedance adaptation. Experimental validation was conducted through collaborative transportation, two interactive Tai Chi pushing hands, and collaborative sawing tasks with multiple human subjects, demonstrating the ability of our framework to achieve human-like collaboration skills and the superior performance from the perspective of interactive forces compared to four other related methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleoperation is essential for autonomous robot learning, especially in manipulation tasks that require human demonstrations or corrections. However, most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS (Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning. Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors, HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the capabilities of robot manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DualMap, an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamically changing environments through natural language queries. Designed for efficient semantic mapping and adaptability to changing environments, DualMap meets the essential requirements for real-world robot navigation applications. Our proposed hybrid segmentation frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging required by prior methods, enabling efficient online scene mapping. The dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate selection with a local concrete map for precise goal-reaching, effectively managing and updating dynamic changes in the environment. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, efficient scene mapping, and online language-guided navigation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and regularly updated collection of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</description>

      <title>DRO-EDL-MPC: Evidential Deep Learning-Based Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control for Safe Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning (EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications. Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative constraints under low confidence.</description>

      <title>BEASST: Behavioral Entropic Gradient based Adaptive Source Seeking for Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious exploration.</description>

      <title>LocoMamba: Vision-Driven Locomotion via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.</description>

Abstract: One of the challenges faced by Autonomous Aerial Vehicles is reliable navigation through urban environments. Factors like reduction in precision of Global Positioning System (GPS), narrow spaces and dynamically moving obstacles make the path planning of an aerial robot a complicated task. One of the skills required for the agent to effectively navigate through such an environment is to develop an ability to avoid collisions using information from onboard depth sensors. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning of a virtual quadcopter robot agent equipped with a Depth Camera to navigate through a simulated urban environment.</description>

      <title>STITCHER: Constrained Trajectory Planning in Complex Environments with Real-Time Motion Primitive Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Dexterous Arm-Hand VLA Policies via Shared Autonomy: VR Teleoperation Augmented by Autonomous Hand VLA Policy for Efficient Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving human-like dexterous manipulation remains a major challenge for general-purpose robots. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential for achieving human-like dexterity in robots, but the large-scale and diverse bimanual robot datasets remain scarce due to hardware heterogeneity across robotic platforms. To address the challenge, we present RoboCOIN, a comprehensive multi-embodiment bimanual manipulation dataset with over 180,000 demonstrations collected from 15 distinct robotic platforms. The dataset covers 16 scenarios, including residential, commercial, and working environments, with 421 tasks systematically organized by bimanual coordination patterns and object properties. Our key innovation is a hierarchical capability pyramid that provides multi-level annotations, spanning trajectory-level concepts, segment-level subtasks, and frame-level kinematics. We further develop CoRobot, a comprehensive processing framework featuring Robot Trajectory Markup Language (RTML) for quality assessment, automated annotation generation, and unified multi-embodiment management. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of RoboCOIN in multi-embodiment bimanual learning, with significant performance improvements across various model architectures and robotic platforms. The complete dataset and framework are open-sourced and publicly available for further research purposes. Project website: https://FlagOpen.github.io/RoboCOIN/.</description>

      <title>EfficientFlow: Efficient Equivariant Flow Policy Learning for Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.</description>

      <title>MSG-Loc: Multi-Label Likelihood-based Semantic Graph Matching for Object-Level Global Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agricultural robots are serving as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily relying on manual operations or railway systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extended Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on multimodal reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

      <title>Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Robot Locomotion in Complex Terrains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning is the basis of both biological and artificial systems when it comes to mimicking intelligent behaviors. From the classical PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), there is a series of deep reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used in training locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots because of their stability and sample efficiency. However, among all these variants, experiments and simulations often converge prematurely, leading to suboptimal locomotion and reduced task performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation (ECIM), an entropy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in contrast with the PPO series, that can reduce premature convergence by combining intrinsic motivation with adaptive exploration.
  For experiments, in order to parallel with other baselines, we chose to apply it in Isaac Gym across six terrain categories: upward slopes, downward slopes, uneven rough terrain, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and flat ground as widely used. For comparison, our experiments consistently achieve better performance: task rewards increase by 4--12%, peak body pitch oscillation is reduced by 23--29%, joint acceleration decreases by 20--32%, and joint torque consumption declines by 11--20%. Overall, our model ECIM, by combining entropy control and intrinsic motivation control, achieves better results in stability across different terrains for quadrupedal locomotion, and at the same time reduces energetic cost and makes it a practical choice for complex robotic control tasks.</description>

      <title>ESPADA: Execution Speedup via Semantics Aware Demonstration Data Downsampling for Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior-cloning based visuomotor policies enable precise manipulation but often inherit the slow, cautious tempo of human demonstrations, limiting practical deployment. However, prior studies on acceleration methods mainly rely on statistical or heuristic cues that ignore task semantics and can fail across diverse manipulation settings. We present ESPADA, a semantic and spatially aware framework that segments demonstrations using a VLM-LLM pipeline with 3D gripper-object relations, enabling aggressive downsampling only in non-critical segments while preserving precision-critical phases, without requiring extra data or architectural modifications, or any form of retraining. To scale from a single annotated episode to the full dataset, ESPADA propagates segment labels via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) on dynamics-only features. Across both simulation and real-world experiments with ACT and DP baselines, ESPADA achieves approximately a 2x speed-up while maintaining success rates, narrowing the gap between human demonstrations and efficient robot control.</description>

      <title>Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.</description>

      <title>WholeBodyVLA: Towards Unified Latent VLA for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11047</link>

Abstract: Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To execute the desired locomotion commands more precisely, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RGB images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a two-step sequential process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI and TOD datasets, as well as on our reconstructed transparent object dataset, T-ROBI. Under the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our approach achieves high pose accuracy with fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies across all evaluated datasets. The accompanying video and T-ROBI dataset will be released on our project page: https://trailab.github.io/ActiveODPE.</description>

      <title>Ctrl-Crash: Controllable Diffusion for Realistic Car Crashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years; however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Camera Calibration via Circular Patterns: A Comprehensive Framework with Detection Uncertainty and Unbiased Projection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance. To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity. The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at https://github.com/chaehyeonsong/discocal.</description>

      <title>SoMi-ToM: Evaluating Multi-Perspective Theory of Mind in Embodied Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Rotation-Invariant Convolution for UAV Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.
  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.</description>
