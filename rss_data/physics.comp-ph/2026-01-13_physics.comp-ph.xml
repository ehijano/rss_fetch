      <title>Efficient GPU-computing simulation platform JAX-PF for differentiable phase field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JAX-PF, an open-source, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable Phase Field (PF) software package, supporting both explicit and implicit time stepping schemes. Leveraging the modern computing architecture JAX, JAX-PF achieves high performance through array programming and GPU acceleration, delivering ~5x speedup over PRISMS-PF with MPI (24 CPU cores) for systems with ~4.19 million degrees of freedom using explicit schemes, and scaling efficiently with implicit schemes for large-size problems. Furthermore, a key feature of JAX-PF is automatic differentiation (AD), eliminating manual derivations of free-energy functionals and Jacobians. Beyond forward simulations, JAX-PF demonstrates its potential in inverse design by providing sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate, for the first time, the calibration of PF material parameters using AD-based sensitivities, highlighting its capability for high-dimensional inverse problems. By combining efficiency, flexibility, and full differentiability, JAX-PF offers a fast, practical, and integrated tool for forward simulation and inverse design, advancing co-designing of material and manufacturing processes and supporting the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative.</description>

      <title>Slowdown and saturation of internal time according to the statistics of information input: a minimal model of response systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a response system that updates its internal state in accordance with information input arriving from outside. In this paper, we define as internal time the ``number of kinds'' of codes that have been observed at least once up to a given time, and analyze how the way internal time advances is determined by the statistics of information input (arrival rate and code distribution). When arrivals follow a Poisson process, the average advancing speed of internal time decreases monotonically with time, and if the number of kinds of codes is finite, it eventually approaches an upper limit and saturates. As a result, on long time scales, internal time becomes relatively shorter than physical time. For a uniform code distribution, we provide a closed form for the correspondence between internal time and physical time, and show that the physical time required to ``advance internal time by one step'' increases in later stages. As an ancillary quantity, we quantify by conditional entropy the remaining uncertainty of ``which codes have been observed'' when only internal time is known, and we give unimodality and the maximization time in the uniform case, and upper bounds, equality conditions, and expressions of the difference from the upper bound in the non-uniform case. Finally, we also present a generalization that assigns weights (description lengths) to each code so that internal time is ticked according to the amount of information in the input.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced-Complexity Modeling of Fluid Flows: A Community Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a community challenge designed to facilitate direct comparisons between data-driven methods for compression, forecasting, and sensing of complex aerospace flows. The challenge is organized into three tracks that target these complementary capabilities: compression (compact representations for large datasets), forecasting (predicting future flow states from a finite history), and sensing (inferring unmeasured flow states from limited measurements). Across these tracks, multiple challenges span diverse flow datasets and use cases, each emphasizing different model requirements. The challenge is open to anyone, and we invite broad participation to build a comprehensive and balanced picture of what works and where current methods fall short. To support fair comparisons, we provide standardized success metrics, evaluation tools, and baseline implementations, with one classical and one machine-learning baseline per challenge. Final assessments use blind tests on withheld data. We explicitly encourage negative results and careful analyses of limitations. Outcomes will be disseminated through an AIAA Journal Virtual Collection and invited presentations at AIAA conferences.</description>

      <title>Simulation package for solving dynamic diffraction problems in deformed crystals. Bragg, Laue geometry, asymmetric reflections, bend crystals, dislocations, crystals with arbitrary shapes, strain distributions and time dependent problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the Fast Fourier Transform Beam Propagation Method (FFT BPM) to simulate dynamic diffraction effects, including scattering from deformed crystals with arbitrary shapes in Bragg, Laue, and asymmetric geometries. The method's straightforward algorithm, combined with FFT, enables fast computation and is easy to implement in Python. It successfully reproduces literature results for bent crystals, dislocations, and finite-shaped crystals simulated using the Takagi-Taupin equations. Python implementations for each case are provided in a public GitHub repository, with the code structured for parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Tree Search for High-Dimensional Computational Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.</description>

      <title>TCLNet: A Hybrid Transformer-CNN Framework Leveraging Language Models as Lossless Compressors for CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency. However, the CSI feedback overhead becomes a major bottleneck as the number of antennas increases. Although existing deep learning-based CSI compression methods have shown great potential, they still face limitations in capturing both local and global features of CSI, thereby limiting achievable compression efficiency. To address these issues, we propose TCLNet, a unified CSI compression framework that integrates a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture for lossy compression with a hybrid language model (LM) and factorized model (FM) design for lossless compression. The lossy module jointly exploits local features and global context, while the lossless module adaptively switches between context-aware coding and parallel coding to optimize the rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) trade-off. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed TCLNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and transmission efficiency, achieving up to a 5 dB performance gain across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we show that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged as zero-shot CSI lossless compressors via carefully designed prompts.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained Gaussian Processes for Predicting Shockwave Hugoniot Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physics-constrained Gaussian Process regression framework is developed for predicting shocked material states along the Hugoniot curve using data from a small number of shockwave simulations. The proposed Gaussian process employs a probabilistic Taylor series expansion in conjunction with the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions between the various shocked material states to construct a thermodynamically consistent covariance function. This leads to the formulation of an optimization problem over a small number of interpretable hyperparameters and enables the identification of regime transitions, from a leading elastic wave to trailing plastic and phase transformation waves. This work is motivated by the need to investigate shock-driven material response for materials discovery and for offering mechanistic insights in regimes where experimental characterizations and simulations are costly. The proposed methodology relies on large-scale molecular dynamics which are an accurate but expensive computational alternative to experiments. Under these constraints, the proposed methodology establishes Hugoniot curves from a limited number of molecular dynamics simulations. We consider silicon carbide as a representative material and atomic-level simulations are performed using a reverse ballistic approach together with appropriate interatomic potentials. The framework reproduces the Hugoniot curve with satisfactory accuracy while also quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions using the Gaussian Process posterior.</description>

      <title>Essentially No Energy Barrier Between Independent Fermionic Neural Quantum State Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.</description>

      <title>Hidden free energy released by explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the familiar two-stream instability is the result of spontaneous parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking in a conservative system, and more importantly, explicit PT-symmetry breaking by viscosity can destabilize the system in certain parameter regimes that are stable when viscosity vanishes. This reveals that complex systems may possess hidden free energies protected by PT-symmetry and viscosity, albeit dissipative, can expose the systems to these freed energies by breaking PT-symmetry explicitly. Such a process is accompanied by instability and total variation growth.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven shifts of the Potts transition on spherical Fibonacci graphs: a graph-convolutional transfer-learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q&gt;4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length.</description>

      <title>Noise enhances odor source localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning nonequilibrium phase transitions in charge-density wave insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description>

      <title>A density functional theory study of amino acids on Mg and Mg-based alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.</description>

      <title>Resolvent4py: a parallel Python package for analysis, model reduction and control of large-scale linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present resolvent4py, a parallel Python package for the analysis, model reduction and control of large-scale linear systems with millions or billions of degrees of freedom. This package provides the user with a friendly Python-like experience (akin to that of well-established libraries such as numpy and scipy), while enabling MPI-based parallelism through mpi4py, petsc4py and slepc4py. In turn, this allows for the development of streamlined and efficient Python code that can be used to solve several problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, graph theory, molecular dynamics and several other fields.</description>

      <title>TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common exact diagonalization-based techniques to solving tight-binding models suffer from O(N^2) and O(N^3) scaling with respect to model size in memory and CPU time, hindering their applications in large tight-binding models. On the contrary, the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM) can achieve linear scaling in both memory and CPU time, and is capable of handling large tight-binding models with billions of orbitals. In this paper, we introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on TBPM. This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order of magnitude. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, partial diagonalization for specific eigenvalues and eigenstates, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.</description>

      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Revisiting superradiance dynamics from single diamond nanocrystals with a physically consistent model for fluorescence decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Computational Roles of Nonlinearity in Sequence Modeling Using Almost-Linear RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling tasks across domains such as natural language processing, time series forecasting, and control require learning complex input-output mappings. Nonlinear recurrence is theoretically required for universal approximation of sequence-to-sequence functions, yet linear recurrent models often prove surprisingly effective. This raises the question of when nonlinearity is truly required. We present a framework to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks, identifying when it is computationally necessary and what mechanisms it enables. We address this using Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs), which allow recurrence nonlinearity to be gradually attenuated and decompose network dynamics into analyzable linear regimes, making computational mechanisms explicit. We illustrate the framework across diverse synthetic and real-world tasks, including classic sequence modeling benchmarks, a neuroscientific stimulus-selection task, and a multi-task suite. We demonstrate how the AL-RNN's piecewise linear structure enables identification of computational primitives such as gating, rule-based integration, and memory-dependent transients, revealing that these operations emerge within predominantly linear backbones. Across tasks, sparse nonlinearity improves interpretability by reducing and localizing nonlinear computations, promotes shared representations in multi-task settings, and reduces computational cost. Moreover, sparse nonlinearity acts as a useful inductive bias: in low-data regimes or when tasks require discrete switching between linear regimes, sparsely nonlinear models often match or exceed fully nonlinear architectures. Our findings provide a principled approach for identifying where nonlinearity is functionally necessary, guiding the design of recurrent architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the analytical Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains as good as in existing approximation-based codes due to high-order implicit methods that take long time steps, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian and efficient sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Results agree with established codes to 0.1% with standard precision. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is available at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes all contributions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of low-dimensional Fermi fluids of dipolar atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range, softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices, as is common in U-Net-based flow matching and diffusion models. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Criticality from Protected Mean-Field Dynamics: Loop Stability and Internal Renormalization in Reflective Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reflective homeostatic dynamics provides a minimal mechanism for self-organized criticality in neural systems. Starting from a reduced stochastic description, we demonstrate within the MSRJD field-theoretic framework that fluctuation effects do not destabilize the critical manifold. Instead, loop corrections are dynamically regularized by homeostatic curvature, yielding a protected mean-field critical surface that remains marginally stable under coarse-graining. Beyond robustness, we show that response-driven structural adaptation generates intrinsic parameter flows that attract the system toward this surface without external fine tuning. Together, these results unify loop renormalization and adaptive response in a single framework and establish a concrete route to autonomous criticality in reentrant neural dynamics.</description>
