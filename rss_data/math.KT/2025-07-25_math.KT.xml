      <title>Motivic Steenrod problem away from the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In topology, the Steenrod problem asks whether every singular homology class is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold. Here, we introduce an analogous question in algebraic geometry: is every element on the Chow line of the motivic cohomology of $X$ the pushforward of a fundamental class along a projective derived-lci morphism? If $X$ is a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p \geq 0$, then a positive answer to this question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by alterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily so: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$ that are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A consequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be expressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the first-named-author in his thesis.</description>

      <title>Totally acyclic complexes and homological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivalent characterizations of the condition that every acyclic complex of projective (resp., injective and flat) modules is totally acyclic over a general ring R. This line of inquiry was initiated by Iyengar and Krause in 2006 for commutative Noetherian rings with dualizing complexes. We demonstrate that certain equivalent conditions are closely related to the invariants silp(R) and spli(R) defined by Gedrich and Gruenberg, as well as to the invariant sfli(R) defined by Ding and Chen. We also examine some sufficient conditions for the equality spli(R) = silp(R). This improves a result by Ballas and Chatzistavridis that was originally proved in the case that R is a left (and right) coherent ring which is isomorphic with its opposite ring, and a result by Wang and Yang that was originally proved in the case that R is a commutative generalized coherent ring. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate relations among these conditions.</description>
