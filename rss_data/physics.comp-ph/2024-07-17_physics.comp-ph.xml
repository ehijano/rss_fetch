      <title>Machine learning accelerated prediction of Ce-based ternary compounds involving antagonistic pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel quantum materials within ternary phase spaces containing antagonistic pair such as Fe with Bi, Pb, In, and Ag, presents significant challenges yet holds great potential. In this work, we investigate the stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium (Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine learning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently explore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable Ce-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the identification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are evaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not only contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable alternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.</description>

      <title>From Prediction to Experimental Realization of Ferroelectric Wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$N Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlN-based alloys find widespread application in high-power microelectronics, optoelectronics, and electromechanics. The realization of ferroelectricity in wurtzite AlN-based heterostructural alloys has opened up the possibility of directly integrating ferroelectrics with conventional microelectronics based on tetrahedral semiconductors such as Si, SiC and III-Vs, enabling compute-in-memory architectures, high-density data storage, and more. The discovery of AlN-based wurtzite ferroelectrics has been driven to date by chemical intuition and empirical explorations. Here, we demonstrate the computationally-guided discovery and experimental demonstration of new ferroelectric wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$N alloys. First-principles calculations indicate that the minimum energy pathway for switching changes from a collective to an individual switching process with a lower overall energy barrier, at a rare-earth fraction $x$ of $x&gt;$ 0.10$-$0.15. Experimentally, ferroelectric switching is observed at room temperature in Al$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$N films with $x&gt;$ 0.12, which strongly supports the switching mechanisms in wurtzite ferroelectrics proposed previously (Lee et al., $\textit{Science Advances}$ 10, eadl0848, 2024). This is also the first demonstration of ferroelectricity in an AlN-based alloy with a magnetic rare-earth element, which could pave the way for additional functionalities such as multiferroicity and opto-ferroelectricity in this exciting class of AlN-based materials.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium wall model for large eddy simulations of complex flows exhibiting turbulent smooth body separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a non-equilibrium wall model is proposed for the prediction of turbulent flows experiencing adverse pressure gradients, including separated flow regimes. The mean-flow nonequilibrium is identified by comparing two characteristic velocities: the friction velocity (u_tau) and the viscous-pressure gradient velocity (up). In regions where the pressure gradient velocity is comparable to the friction velocity (up \sim u_tau, the near-wall turbulent closure is modified to include the effect of the pressure-gradient and convective terms. The performance of this wall model is evaluated in two canonical flows experiencing smooth body separation: the NASA-Boeing speed bump and the Bachalo-Johnson bump. Improvements in the predictive capabilities of the proposed model for the conventional equilibrium wall model are theorized and then demonstrated through numerical experiments. In particular, the proposed wall model can capture the onset of boundary layer separation observed in experiments or DNS calculations at resolutions where the equilibrium wall model fails to separate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining computational techniques such as reactive molecular dynamics and first-principle quantum transport calculations. From reactive molecular dynamics study we clearly observe a formation of conductive filament of gold atoms from the top electrode on to the 2D MoS2 layer. This state was described the onset of low-resistance state from the initial high-resistance state. To further understand the switching mechanism in the device we deploy first-principle calculations where we see an electron channel being formed during the filament formation leading to the low-resistance state of the device. MoS2 with single defect gives rise to a conductance ratio of LRS to the initial structure is 63.1336 and that of the LRS to HRS is 1.66.</description>

      <title>Using recurrent neural networks to predict aspects of 3-D structure of folded copolymer sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neural network techniques are developed for artificial sequences based on approximate models of proteins. We only encode the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains without attempting to model the secondary structure. We use our approach to obtain a large set of sequences with known 3-D structures for training the neural network. By employing recurrent neural networks we describe a way to augment a neural network to deal with sequences of realistic length and long-distant interactions between the sequence regions.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity data in large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work.
  The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data through a stationary corrective forcing term in the LES momentum equation working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, the stationary forcing in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. The implementation is based on a three-dimensional LES solver in OpenFOAM, which is extended to allow the computation of adjoint quantities and, ultimately, the adjoint gradient.
  Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature.
  Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i.e., Strouhal number), and turbulent kinetic energy. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.</description>

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride is rapidly gaining interest as a platform for photonic quantum technologies, due to its two-dimensional nature and its ability to host defects deep within its large band gap that may act as room-temperature single-photon emitters. In this review paper we provide an overview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal boron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3) heterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour centres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of this review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect engineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Anti-hyperuniform diluted vortex matter induced by correlated disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform materials are very promising for applications but the successful route for synthesizing them requires to understand the interactions induced by the host media that can switch off this hidden order. With this aim we study the model system of vortices in the $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor where correlated defects seem to play a determinant role for the nucleation of a gel vortex phase at low densities. We directly image vortices in extended fields-of-view and show that the disordered vortex structure in this material is anti-hyperuniform, contrasting with the case of vortex structures nucleated in samples with point-like disorder. Based on numerical simulations, we show that this anti-hyperuniform structure arises both, from the interaction of a diluted vortex structure with a fourfold-symmetric correlated disorder quite likely generated when cleaving the samples and from the out of equilibrium nature of the quenched configuration.</description>

Abstract: The Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field sourced by a static spherically symmetric background is an interesting second-order differential equation with applications in particle physics, astrophysics, and elsewhere. Here we present static solutions for generic source density profiles in the case where the scalar field has no interactions or a mass term. For a $\lambda\phi^4$ self-interaction term, we develop the techniques that are necessary numerical computation. We also provide code to perform the numerical calculations that can be adapted for arbitrary density profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the TRIQS/Nevanlinna analytic continuation package, an efficient implementation of the methods proposed by J. Fei et al in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 056402 (2021)] and [Phys. Rev. B 104, 165111 (2021)]. TRIQS/Nevanlinna strives to provide a high quality open source (distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3) alternative to the more widely adopted Maximum Entropy based analytic continuation programs. With the additional Hardy functions optimization procedure, it allows for an accurate resolution of wide band and sharp features in the spectral function. Those problems can be formulated in terms of imaginary time or Matsubara frequency response functions. The application is based on the TRIQS C++/Python framework, which allows for easy interoperability with other TRIQS-based applications, electronic band structure codes and visualization tools. Similar to other TRIQS packages, it comes with a convenient Python interface.</description>

      <title>Quinpi: Integrating stiff hyperbolic systems with implicit high order finite volume schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\&amp; Comput., 2023) for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to assist limiting in time. In addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-centered a-posteriori time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of unbiased atomic forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a state-of-the-art numerical approach for evaluating accurate expectation values of many-body wavefunctions. However, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders widespread QMC applications is the lack of an affordable scheme to compute unbiased atomic forces. In this study, we propose a very efficient method to obtain unbiased atomic forces and pressures in the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, exploiting the gauge-invariant and locality properties of its geminal representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for H$_2$ and Cl$_2$ molecules and for the cubic boron nitride crystal. Our framework has a better algorithmic scaling with the system size than the traditional finite-difference method, and, in practical applications, is as efficient as single-point VMC calculations. Thus, it paves the way to study dynamical properties of materials, such as phonons, and is beneficial for pursuing more reliable machine-learning interatomic potentials based on unbiased VMC forces.</description>
