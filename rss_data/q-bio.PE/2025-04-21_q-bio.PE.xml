      <title>Continuous and discrete compartmental models for infectious disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of infectious disease propagation is essential for understanding and controlling epidemics. One of the most useful tools for gaining insights into the spread of infectious diseases is mathematical modelling. In terms of mathematical epidemiology, the main models are based on compartments, such as SI, SIR, and SEIR. These models offer mathematical frameworks for representing the proliferation dynamics of various diseases, for instance flu and smallpox. In this work, we explore these models using two distinct mathematical approaches, Cellular Automata (CA) and ODEs. They are able to reproduce the spread dynamics of diseases with their own individuality. CA models incorporate the local interaction among individuals with discrete time and space, while ODEs provide a continuous and simplified view of a disease propagation in large and homogeneous populations. By comparing these two approaches, we find that the shape of the curves of all models is similar for both representations. Although, the growth rates differ between CA and ODE. One of our results is to show that the CA yields a power-law growth, while the ODE growth rate is well-represented by an exponential function. Furthermore, a substantial contribution of our work is using a hyperbolic tangent to fit the initial growth of infected individuals for all the considered models. Our results display a strong correlation between simulated data and adjusted function. We mainly address this successful result by the fact that the hyperbolic function captures both growing: the power-law (when considered the first terms of infinite sums) and combinations of exponential (when the hyperbolic function is written via exponential). Therefore, our work shows that when modelling a disease the choice of mathematical representation is crucial, in particular to model the onset of an
  epidemic.</description>

      <title>Quantifying scale-free behaviors in Rock-Paper-Scissors Models as a function of Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scale-free behavior of the spatial rock-paper-scissors model with May-Leonard dynamics, analyzing specific quantifiers that engender the power-law feature. The main results show that an important parameter that drives the scale-free behavior is the mobility, which can be used to quantitatively describe several scale-free aspects of the model, such as the number of clusters, the characteristic length, the individuals' lifespan and its corresponding mean traveled distance. All of these are novel quantifiers of current practical interest for the study of biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Discrete Stochastic Population Models with Normal Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a stochastic logistic difference equation under the assumption that the population distribution follows a normal distribution. Our focus is on the mathematical relationship between the average growth rate and a newly introduced concept, the uniform structural growth rate, which captures how growth is influenced by the internal distributional structure of the population. We derive explicit relationships linking the uniform structural growth rate to the parameters of the normal distribution and the variance of a small stochastic perturbation. The analysis reveals the existence of two distinct branches of the uniform structural growth rate, corresponding to alternative population states characterized by higher and lower growth rates. This duality provides deeper insights into the dynamics of population growth under stochastic influences. A sufficient condition for the existence of two uniform structural growth rates is established and rigorously proved, demonstrating that there exist infeasible intervals where no uniform structural growth rate can be defined. We also explore the biological significance of these findings, emphasizing the role of stochastic perturbations and the distribution in shaping population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^a$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $a = 1$ and describes Schr\"odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $a = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity.</description>

      <title>One pathogen does not an epidemic make: A review of interacting contagions, diseases, beliefs, and stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From pathogens and computer viruses to genes and memes, contagion models have found widespread utility across the natural and social sciences. Despite their success and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models remain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their development and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given contagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be spreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and social nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the immune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting transmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know that relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and translational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for interactions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and frameworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the contagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of interactions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify promising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for removing a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.</description>

      <title>Beyond classical Hamilton's Rule. State distribution asymmetry and the dynamics of altruism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationships between demographic and state-based evolutionary games and Hamilton's rule. It is shown that the classical Hamilton's rule (counterfactual method), combined with demographic payoffs, leads to easily testable models. It works well when the roles of donor and receiver are randomly drawn during each interaction event. This is illustrated by the alarm call example. However, we can imagine situations in which role-switching results from external mechanism, such as, fluxes of individuals between the border and the interior of the habitat, when only border individuals may spot the threat and warn their neighbors. To cover these cases, a new model is extended to the case with explicit dynamics of the role distributions among carriers of different strategies, driven by some general mechanisms. It is shown that even in the case when fluxes between roles are driven by neutral mechanisms (acting in the same way on all strategies), differences in mortality in the focal interaction lead to different distributions of roles for different strategies. This leads to a more complex rule for cooperation than the classical Hamilton's rule. In addition to the cost and benefit components, the new rule contains a third component weighted by the difference in proportions of the donors among carriers of both strategies. Depending on the sign, this component can be termed the "survival surplus", when the donors survival have greater survival than receivers, or the "sacrifice cost" (when it decreases the benefit), when the receiver's survival exceeds that of the helping donor. When we allow different role-switching rates for different strategies, cooperators can win even in the case when the assortment mechanism is inefficient (i.e., the probability of receiving help for noncooperators is slightly greater than for cooperators), which is impossible in classical Hamilton's rule.</description>

      <title>Estimating invasive rodent abundance using removal data and hierarchical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invasive rodents pose significant ecological, economic, and public health challenges. Robust methods are needed for estimating population abundance to guide effective management. Traditional methods such as capture-recapture are often impractical for invasive species due to ethical, legal and logistical constraints. Here, I showcase the application of hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models for estimating the abundance of invasive rodents using removal data. First, I perform a simulation study which demonstrates minimal bias, as well as good precision and reliable coverage of confidence intervals across a range of sampling scenarios. I also illustrate the consequences of violating the population closure assumption, showing how between-occasion dynamics can bias inference. Second, I analyze removal data for two invasive rodent species, namely coypus (Myocastor coypus) in France and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in the Netherlands. Using hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models, I examine the effects of temperature on abundance while accounting for imperfect and time-varying capture probabilities. I also show how to accommodate spatial variability using random effects, quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates, and account for violations of closure by fitting an open-population model to multi-year data. Overall, I hope to demonstrate the flexibility and utility of hierarchical models in invasive species management.</description>
