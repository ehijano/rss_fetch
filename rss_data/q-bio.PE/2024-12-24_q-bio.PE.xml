      <title>Physical principles underpinning molecular-level protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since protein mutations are the main driving force of evolution at the molecular level, a proper analysis of them (and the factors controlling them) will enable us to find a response to several crucial queries in evolutionary biology. Among them, we highlight the following: At the molecular level, what factors determine whether protein evolution is repeatable? Aiming at finding an answer to this and several other significant questions behind protein evolvability and the factors that control it (including, but not limited to, the proteins' robustness, the evolutionary pathways, the number of ancestors, the epistasis, the post-translational modifications, and the location and order of mutations) we distinguish two evolutionary models in our analysis: convergent and divergent, based on whether or not a target sequence needs to be reached after n-mutational steps beginning with a wild-type protein sequence (from an unknown ancestor). Preliminary results suggest (regardless of whether the evolution is convergent or divergent) a tight relationship between the thermodynamic hypothesis (or Anfinsen's dogma) and protein evolution at the molecular level. This conjecture will allow us to uncover how fundamental physical principles guide protein evolution, and to gain a deeper grasp of mutationally driven evolutionary processes and the factors that influence them. Breaking down complex evolutionary problems into manageable pieces (without compromising the vision of the problem as a whole) could lead to effective solutions to critical evolutionary biology challenges, paving the way for further progress in this field.</description>

      <title>Optimal dosing of anti-cancer treatment under drug-induced plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cancer has traditionally been considered a genetic disease, mounting evidence indicates an important role for non-genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms. Common anti-cancer drugs have recently been observed to induce the adoption of reversible drug-tolerant cell states, thereby accelerating the evolution of drug resistance. Determining how to optimally balance the competing goals of killing the tumor bulk and delaying resistance evolution in this scenario is a nontrivial question of high clinical importance. In this work, we use a combined mathematical and computational approach to study optimal dosing of anti-cancer drug treatment under drug-induced cell plasticity. Our results show that the optimal treatment steers the tumor into a fixed equilibrium composition while balancing the trade-off between cell kill and tolerance induction in a precisely quantifiable way. Under linear induction of tolerance, a low-dose constant strategy is optimal in equilibrium, while under uniform induction of tolerance, alternating between a large dose and no dose is best. The directionality of drug induction, whether the drug elevates transitions from sensitivity to tolerance or inhibits transitions back, significantly affects optimal dosing. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we use it to identify an optimal low-dose strategy for colorectal cancer using publicly available in vitro data.</description>

      <title>Weak signals, strong debates: Density dependence and population regulation through the lens of model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecologists have long argued about the strength of density dependence and population regulation, respectively defined as the short-term and long-term rates of return to equilibrium. Here, I give three arguments for the intractability of population regulation. First, the ecological literature flip-flops on the strength of evidence for population regulation; by simple induction, population regulation should remain uncertain. Second, there is an analogous debate in economics about whether shocks to Gross Domestic Product have transient or permanent effects. This literature is extensive and sophisticated, yet there is no consensus, implying that more research will not resolve the issue in ecology. Third, using a variety of time series models and the Global Population Dynamics Database, I show that one's conclusions about population regulation are almost entirely dependent on model structure. This insurmountable model uncertainty explains why the strength of regulation is unresolved despite decades of research. However, it is possible to achieve the more modest goal of estimating density dependence. I introduce a novel measure of density dependence -- the effective autoregressive parameter -- which is conceptually intuitive and easy to calculate with simulations. The strength of density dependence varies significantly across populations, with an average that can be characterized as moderate: perturbations have an average half-life of 3 years. Rather than a universal balance of nature, stability varies widely across populations in ways that correlate with life history and taxonomy.</description>

      <title>Should public health policy exempt cases with low viral load from isolation during an epidemic?: a modelling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, case isolation emerged as a key non-pharmaceutical intervention in pandemic response. Its effectiveness hinges on the timing of isolation, which is often dictated by the onset of contagiousness. While minimizing isolation delays is crucial, the impact of evolving epidemic dynamics, such as changes in viral load distributions among cases, is less understood. These dynamics could inform more efficient isolation strategies. We developed a multi-scale agent-based model to assess isolation policies that consider viral loads. Our model compares the outcomes of universal isolation with strategies that exempt low viral load cases post-peak. We found that most low viral load cases identified after the peak are less contagious, raising the question of their need for isolation. Our analysis reveals that exempting these individuals slightly increases new infections and, unexpectedly, reduces efficiency, defined as infections averted per isolation. These results advise caution with adaptive isolation policies. Our flexible model can evaluate complex strategies, aiding future public health planning.</description>

      <title>Decoding fairness: a reinforcement learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</description>

      <title>Phenotype-structuring of non-local kinetic models of cell migration driven by environmental sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of cells to form surface extensions, which enable them to non-locally probe the surrounding environment, plays a key role in cell migration. The existing mathematical models for collective migration of cell populations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the simplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal properties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this simplification, we develop a modelling framework wherein a population of migrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures variability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. The framework provides a multiscale representation of collective cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation for the cell distribution in each of phase and phenotype space. Then, considering an appropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential equation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedure employed to derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic one, we first compare the results of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical solutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays, to test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Energy-ordered resource stratification as an agnostic signature of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life hinges on identifying biosignatures, often focusing on gaseous metabolic byproducts as indicators. However, most such biosignatures require assuming specific metabolic processes. It is widely recognized that life on other planets may not resemble that of Earth, but identifying biosignatures ``agnostic'' to such assumptions has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach by considering the generic outcome of life: the formation of competing ecosystems. We use a minimal model to argue that the presence of ecosystem-level dynamics, characterized by ecological interactions and resource competition, may yield biosignatures independent of specific metabolic activities. Specifically, we propose the emergent stratification of chemical resources in order of decreasing energy content as a candidate new biosignature. While likely inaccessible to remote sensing, this signature could be relevant for sample return missions, or for detection of ancient signatures of life on Earth itself.</description>
