      <title>Design of a Fast Reactive Tuner for 1.3 GHz TESLA cavities at MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a state-of-the-art design of a Ferroelectric Fast Reactive Tuner (FE-FRT), capable of modulating high reactive power in TESLA type cavities on a microsecond time scale. The Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator employs superconducting radio frequency cavities operating at 1.3 GHz, achieving quality factors on the order of $10^{10}$. However, detuning of $\pm$25 Hz induced by microphonics have led to the use of strong coupling for the fundamental power coupler, requiring high-power amplifiers, orders of magnitude above the intrinsic dissipation. Current solutions to mitigate microphonics rely on piezoelectric tuners, which are not fast enough for the spectral range of the microphonics. A novel alternative is the FE-FRT, a technology made possible by the development of low-loss ferroelectric materials, which offer sub-microsecond response times. Analytical results are provided along with their validation through finite-element simulations. The FE-FRT is expected to handle substantial reactive power while offering a tuning range of 50 Hz in these type of cavities, resulting in a reduction in peak forward RF power by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Estimation of superconducting cavity bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabled by progress in superconducting technology, several continuous wave linear accelerators are foreseen in the next decade. For these machines, it is of crucial importance to track the main cavity parameters, such as the resonator bandwidth and detuning. The bandwidth yields information on the superconducting state of the cavity. The detuning should be minimized to limit the required power to operate the cavity. The estimation of these parameters is commonly implemented in the digital electronics of the Low-Level RF control system to minimize the computation delay. In this proceeding, we present a way to compute the bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer. In contrast to previous methods, a state observer yields estimations at the native control system sample rate without explicitly filtering the input signals. Additionally, the error convergence properties of the estimations can be controlled intuitively by adjusting gain parameters. Implementation considerations and test results on the derived observer are presented in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Focusing to Suppress Emittance Transfer in Crab-Crossing Flat Beam Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat hadron beam collisions, though expected to enhance peak luminosity by about an order of magnitude, have not yet been demonstrated. Our study reveals a critical limitation: realistic fluctuations, when amplified by synchro-betatron resonance, lead to transverse emittance transfer in flat-beam collisions. Using beam-beam simulations based on Electron-Ion Collider design parameters, we show that this effect leads to vertical emittance growth, which can distort the flat-beam profile and degrade luminosity. We propose a dynamic focusing scheme that combines sextupoles with crab cavities to suppress the hourglass-induced resonance. This approach increases tolerance to fluctuations and improves the robustness of flat-beam collisions. This practical mitigation facilitates the adoption of flat-beam collisions in next-generation lepton-hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>
