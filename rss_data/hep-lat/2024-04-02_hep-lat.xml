      <title>Study of Curved Domain-wall Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider fermion systems on square lattice spaces with a curved domain-wall mass term. In a similar way to the flat case, we find massless and chiral states localized at the wall. In the case of $S^1$ and $S^2$ domain-wall embedded into a square lattice, we find that these edge states feel gravity through the induced spin connection. In the conventional continuum limit of the higher dimensional lattice, we find a good consistency with the analytic results in the continuum theory. We also confirm that the rotational symmetry is recovered automatically.
  We also discuss the effect of a $U(1)$ gauge connection on a two-dimensional lattice fermion with the $S^1$ domain-wall mass term. We find that the gauge field changes the eigenvalue spectrum of the boundary system by the Aharanov-Bohm effect and generates an anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$) symmetry. Our numerical evaluation is consistent with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index, which describes the cancellation of the $T$ anomaly by the topological term on the bulk system. When we squeeze the flux inside one plaquette while keeping the total flux unchanged, the anomaly inflow undergoes a drastic change. The intense flux gives rise to an additional domain wall around the flux. We observe a novel localized mode at the flux, canceling the $T$ anomaly on the wall instead of the topological term in the bulk.
  We apply the study to a problem in condensed matter physics. It is known that inside topological insulators, a vortex or monopole acquires a fractional electric charge and turns into a dyon. Describing the topological insulator as a negative mass region of a Dirac fermion, we provide a microscopic description of this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical domain-wall creation.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constraints and the dispersive matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated estimates of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$ and $R(D^{(*)})$ based on all the available theoretical and experimental data on semileptonic $B \to D^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell$ decays. These values have been obtained by using the Dispersive Matrix method to describe the hadronic form factors. By analysing all the lattice data we get the theoretical values $R^{\rm th}(D) = 0.296 \pm 0.008$ and $R^{\rm th}(D^*) = 0.262 \pm 0.009$, which are consistent with the corresponding HFLAV averages at the $\simeq 2.0\,\sigma$ and the $\simeq 1.5\,\sigma$ level, respectively. Moreover, from a bin-per-bin study of the experimental data we obtain the values $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (41.0 \pm 1.2) \cdot10^{-3}$ from $B \to D$ decay and $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (39.92 \pm 0.64) \cdot10^{-3}$ from $B \to D^*$ one, whose differences with the latest inclusive determinations never exceed the $\simeq 2.5\,\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group directly formulated in $d=3$ spatial dimensions with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators. We find infrared fixed points spanned throughout the entire flavor number range that are inaccessible in the $\epsilon$ expansion. Stability analyses around the fixed points show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_A(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order transition, which could become almost continuous if the axial symmetry breaking is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the penguin-mediated decays $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions. We propose a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of longitudinal branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced sensitivity to New Physics. It exhibits a deviation at the $1.48\, \sigma$ level between its experimental value and its SM determination within QCD factorisation. This result can be accommodated together with the significant deviations found for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works, if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower compared to $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$) is in better agreement with the SM. If we add the measured longitudinal branching ratio for the $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ to our analysis, the simultaneous explanation of all the experimental data for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and the $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ operators only becomes very constrained. This set of observables can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics either in $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ or $C_{6f},C_{8gf}$ in both $f=d,s$. This should provide a strong incentive for the LHCb experiment to perform a new measurement of the longitudinal branching ratio for $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$, measured only by BaBar and Belle.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra of Full-Heavy and Double-Heavy Tetraquark States in the Conventional Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the $S$-wave heavy tetraquark states with identical quarks and antiquarks, specifically $QQ{\bar Q'}\bar Q'$ ($Q, Q'=c,b$), $QQ\bar s\bar s$/$\bar Q\bar Q ss$, and $QQ\bar q\bar q$/$\bar Q\bar Q qq$ ($q=u,d$), are studied in a unified constituent quark model. This model contains the one-gluon exchange and confinement potentials. The latter is modeled as the sum of all two-body linear potentials. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the full four-body Schr\"{o}dinger equations, and search bound and resonant states using the complex-scaling method. We then identify $3$ bound and $62$ resonant states. The bound states are all $QQ\bar q\bar q$ states with the isospin and spin-parity quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$: two bound $bb\bar{q}\bar{q}$ states with the binding energies, 153 MeV and 4 MeV below the $BB^*$ threshold, and a shallow $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}$ state at $-15$ MeV from the $DD^*$ threshold. The deeper $bb\bar q \bar q$ bound state aligns with the lattice QCD predictions, while $cc\bar q\bar q$ bound state, still has a much larger binding energy than the recently observed $T^+_{cc}$ by LHCb collaboration. No bound states are identified for the $QQ\bar Q'\bar Q'$, $QQ\bar s\bar s$ and $QQ\bar q\bar q$ with $I=1$. Our analysis shows that the bound $QQ\bar Q'\bar Q'$ states are more probable with a larger mass ratio, $m_Q/m_{Q'}$. Experimental investigation for these states is desired, which will enrich our understanding of hadron spectroscopy and probe insights into the confinement mechanisms within tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Real-space blocking of qubit variables on parallel lattice gauge theory links for quantum simulation</title>

Abstract: One of the methods proposed in the last years for studying non-perturbative gauge theory physics is quantum simulation, where lattice gauge theories are mapped onto quantum devices which can be built in the laboratory, or quantum computers. While being very promising and already showing some experimental results, these methods still face several challenges related to the interface between the technological capabilities and the demands of the simulated models; in particular, one such challenge is the need to simulate infinitely dimensional local Hilbert spaces, describing the gauge fields on the links in the case of compact Lie gauge groups, requiring some truncations and approximations which are not completely understood or controllable in the general case. This work proposes a way to obtain arbitrarily large such local Hilbert spaces by using coarse graining of simple, low dimensional qubit systems, made of components available on most quantum simulation platforms, and thus opening the way of new types of lattice gauge theory quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality lost</title>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Machine learning holographic black hole from lattice QCD equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on lattice QCD results of equation of state (EOS) and baryon number susceptibility at zero baryon chemical potential, and supplemented by machine learning techniques, we construct the analytic form of the holographic black hole metric in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework for pure gluon, 2-flavor, and 2+1-flavor systems, respectively. The dilaton potentials solved from Einstein equations are in good agreement with the extended non-conformal DeWolfe-Gubser-Rosen (DGR) type dilaton potentials fixed by lattice QCD EOS, which indicates the robustness of the EMD framework. The predicted critical endpoint (CEP) in the 2+1-flavor system is located at $(T^c$=0.094GeV, $\mu^c_B$=0.74GeV), which is close to the results from the realistic Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(PNJL) model, the functional renormalization group, and the holographic model with extended DeWolfe-Gubser-Rosen dilaton potential.</description>
