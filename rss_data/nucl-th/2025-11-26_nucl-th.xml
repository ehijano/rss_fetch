      <title>Relaxation of a single-particle excitation in a Fermi system within the diffusion approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of the Wigner distribution function for a single-particle excitation in a Fermi system was studied within the framework of the diffusion approximation of kinetic theory by numerically solving a nonlinear diffusion equation with constant kinetic coefficients. A method was proposed to separate the dissipative processes into contributions from the relaxation of the single-particle excitation and from the relaxation of the nuclear core, with a distinct relaxation time introduced for each process. The influence of the diffusion and drift coefficients on the characteristic relaxation time scale was analyzed. It was found that the resulting relaxation times exhibit a discrepancy relative to the kinetic coefficient estimates known from previous studies.</description>

      <title>The covariant equations of motion of massive spinning particles in a background Yang-Mills field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong classical color field, known as the glasma, is generated in the earliest stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and can significantly influence the momentum and spin dynamics of hard probes such as quarks and jets. Most existing studies based on the classical equations of motion in a background Yang-Mills field, such as Wong equations, may not capture the full range of effects, for example, they neglect the Stern-Gerlach force experienced by spinning particles in non-uniform glasma fields. Although several extensions of Wong equations have been proposed to include spin degrees of freedom, they generally fail to satisfy all the required conditions simultaneously, such as Lorentz covariance, allowance for an arbitrary chromomagnetic moment, and respect for the necessary physical constraints. In this work, we extend the framework of a relativistic classical spinning particle in an electromagnetic field to describe spin one-half quarks propagating in a background non-Abelian Yang-Mills field. By systematically applying the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we derive self-consistent equations of motion for the particle's coordinates, momenta, spin, and color charge that satisfy all these requirements. This formalism provides a more complete and physically relevant description for studying momentum diffusion and spin polarization phenomena of hard probes in the glasma.</description>

      <title>Discrete non-orthogonal shell model for nuclear structure: Towards heavy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent developments of the Discrete Non-Orthogonal Shell Model (DNO-SM) for nuclear structure studies far from stability. Exact shell-model solutions are obtained for typical open-shell light sd and pf nuclei using non-orthogonal Slater determinants consistently derived from the variation after projection approach. The latter represents a powerful method to include correlations from particle-hole excitations. Applications to proton-rich nuclei at the N$\sim$Z line show the important role of these correlations to probe the structure transition in the $^{84,86}$Mo isotopes. We finally present a first complete description of low-lying spectroscopy in the superheavy 254 No, reproducing excellently various band structures and isomers in this challenging nucleus.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Understanding of the Dense Matter Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to understand the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities have grown more sophisticated over the past decade, driven by a surge in high-precision data from both terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. While for the former, heavy-ion collisions (HIC) represent a unique opportunity to constraint the EOS in a controlled laboratory setting, the latter can be precisely probed thanks to the advent of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA). However, as we move away from our understanding drawn from individual sources and limited statistics to the era of precision physics with improved datasets, the need for a systematic way to combine them becomes clear. In this article, we trace the individual methods for extracting the EOS both for HIC and MMA. We then review the current state-of-the-art efforts to combine these individual information sources from Bayesian multi-source analysis, e.g., the Nuclear Physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) and Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) frameworks, and fully integrated EOS frameworks, i.e., the Modular Unified Solver for the Equation of State (MUSES) calculation engine. We highlight the scientific advances made possible by each step and outline the remaining challenges that must be addressed to build a coherent, predictive picture of dense nuclear matter across all relevant regimes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES with Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of neutron stars and the precise measurement of their macroscopic properties have provided valuable insights into fundamental physics, both by constraining the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions and by enabling tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($\Lambda^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\sqrt{\Lambda^{(0)}/\Lambda^{(2)}} \equiv M\omega_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\sim 5\%$ for the $\Lambda^{(0)}$-$\Lambda^{(2)}$ relation and $\sim 2.5\%$ for the $\Lambda^{(0)}$-$M\omega_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>First determination of fragmentation functions in an exotic-hadron candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \ll M_s \sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Matrix approximations of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Extracting GPDs from Exclusive Photon Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new framework for studying generic $2 \to 3$ hard exclusive reactions, referred to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEP), has been introduced to provide a cleaner separation of the underlying physical mechanisms. In this work, we expand this formalism to the case of exclusive real-photon electroproduction off a nucleon, $e(\ell) + N(p) \to e(\ell') + N(p') + \gamma(q')$, which represents the classical channel for accessing generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in nucleons and nuclei. This extension enables a more systematic and physically transparent formulation of the reaction dynamics, paving the way for improved extractions of GPDs from experimental data as compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Precision thermodynamics of the strongly interacting Fermi gas in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-species cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two spatial dimensions undergoes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) crossover as a function of $\ln (k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering length. However, the nature of this crossover in the strong coupling regime $\ln(k_F a) \sim 1$ remains poorly understood. In this work we use canonical-ensemble auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods on discrete lattices to calculate several thermodynamical quantities in the strongly interacting regime, and eliminate systematic errors by extrapolating to continuous time and taking the continuum limit. In particular, we present results for the condensate fraction, spin susceptibility, contact, energy equation of state, and the free energy staggering gap. We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap. These results can be used as a benchmark for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower bound to the amount of isospin impurities in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, caused by the violation of isospin symmetry. The bound is fixed by the difference between the neutron and proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. It can be used to check the consistency of advanced many-body calculations accounting for the breaking of isospin symmetry. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of isospin impurities, providing an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Application of the microscopic optical potential of chiral effective field theory in astrophysical neutron-capture reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A state-of-the-art microscopic global nucleon-nucleus optical potential has been developed by Whitehead, Lim, and Holt (WLH) within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, incorporating realistic nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. Given its potentially greater predictive power for reactions involving exotic isotopes, we apply it to the calculations of astrophysical neutron-capture reactions for the first time, which are particularly important to the nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron. It is found that this potential provides a good description of experimental known neutron-capture cross sections and Maxwellian-averaged cross sections. For unstable neutron-rich nuclei, we comprehensively calculate the neutron-capture reaction rates for all nuclei with $26\leq Z\leq84$, located between the valley of stability and the neutron drip line, using the backward-forward Monte Carlo method with the $f_{rms}$ deviation as the $\chi^2$ estimator. The results reveal a noticeable separation in the uncertainty of rates around an isospin asymmetry of 0.28 under the constraint $f_{rms} \leq 1.56$. This highlights the critical role of isospin dependence in optical potentials and suggests that future developments of the WLH potential may pay special attention to the isospin dependence.</description>

Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbar\Omega$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach for predicting multiple observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC</title>

Abstract: We develop a neural network model, based on the processes of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, to study and predict several experimental observables in Au+Au collisions. We present a data-driven deep learning framework for predicting multiple bulk observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. A single neural network is trained exclusively on experimental measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions, transverse-momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients over a broad range of collision energies and centralities. The network architecture is inspired by the stages of a heavy-ion collision, from the quark-gluon plasma to chemical and kinetic freeze-out, and employs locally connected hidden layers and a structured input design that encodes basic geometric and kinematic features of the system. We demonstrate that these physics-motivated choices significantly improve test performance compared to purely fully connected baselines. The trained model is then used to predict the above observables at collision energies not yet explored experimentally at RHIC, and the results are validated using the energy dependence of the total charged-particle multiplicity per participant pair as well as comparisons to a CLVisc hydrodynamic calculation with TRENTo initial conditions. Our findings indicate that such physics-guided neural networks can serve as efficient surrogates to fill critical data gaps at RHIC and to support further phenomenological studies of QGP properties.</description>

      <title>The LPM effect in sequential bremsstrahlung 2: factorization</title>

Abstract: The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In this paper, we continue analysis of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-gluon approximations. In particular, this paper analyzes the subtle problem of how to precisely separate overlapping double splitting (e.g.\ overlapping double bremsstrahlung) from the case of consecutive, independent bremsstrahlung (which is the case that would be implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation based solely on single splitting rates). As an example of the method, we consider the rate of real double gluon bremsstrahlung from an initial gluon with various simplifying assumptions (thick media; $\hat q$ approximation; large $N_c$; and neglect for the moment of processes involving 4-gluon vertices) and explicitly compute the correction $\Delta\,d\Gamma/dx\,dy$ due to overlapping formation times.</description>

      <title>Momentum expansions in finite-density perturbative calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Violation and large-$N_c$ spin-flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the contribution of the QCD $\bar \theta$ term to the CP violating pion-nucleon couplings and the nucleon electric dipole moment in a combined large-$N_c$ and chiral perturbation theory framework. In particular, we approach this issue through the emergent spin-flavor symmetry of the baryon sector at large but finite $N_c$. We obtain good agreement with previous analyses for the pion-nucleon couplings and show that the large-$N_c$ framework indicates that tree-level contributions to the electric dipole moment possibly play a dominant role. The spin-flavor symmetry also enables us to provide novel constraints on CP violating pion-$\Delta$ couplings as well as the $\Delta$ electric dipole moment and $\Delta N$ transition moment.</description>
