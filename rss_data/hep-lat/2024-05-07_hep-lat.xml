      <title>Vector $K^{*}$ mesons in external magnetic field from SU(3) gluodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ground state energies of the neutral and charged vector $K^{*}$ mesons in the external abelian magnetic field of QCD scale using overlap fermions. We calculate the magnetic dipole polarizability of the $K^{*0}$ and $\bar{K}^{*0}$ mesons and investigate its dependence on the ratio of the strange quark mass to the light quark mass. It is found that the ground state energy and the magnetic dipole polarizability depends on the meson spin projection on the magnetic field axis. This leads to the appearance of dileptonic asymmetry, which can be characterized by the tensor polarizability value estimated for the $K^{*0}$ mesons. We found that the $g$-factor of the vector $K^{*\pm}$ mesons depends on the $m_s/m_u$ value. Also we do not observe any evidence of the tachyonic mode existence for the strange vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Gauging staggered fermion shift symmetries and lattice anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staggered fermion shift symmetries correspond to translations within the unit cell of a hypercubic lattice. They satisfy an algebra and in four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of $SU(4)$ which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered fermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global parameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation symmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To maintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher form gauge fields. We show how there is a geometrical obstruction to this procedure in the case of full staggered fermions which is consistent with the existence of a 't Hooft anomaly in the continuum $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry. However no such obstruction is encountered for reduced staggered fermions for which the continuum non-anomalous flavor symmetry is $SO(4)$.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and low-dimensionalization in four dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of low-dimensionalization in 4D QCD. We propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate low-dimensionalization in the DR gauge in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider ``$tz$-projection'' of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, 4D QCD is reduced into an ensemble of 2D QCD systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <title>Is holographic quark-gluon plasma homogeneous?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present evidence for a spatially modulated instability within the deconfined quark-gluon plasma phase of QCD. This evidence is based on robust predictions from generic holographic models, accurately fitted to lattice data, where the instability is driven by the Chern-Simons term mandated by the flavor anomalies of QCD. Such an instability occurs universally across holographic models at surprisingly low densities, within the crossover region amenable to lattice and experimental studies, therefore inviting further explorations of inhomogeneous phases in this region.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of $\boldsymbol{(2+1)}$D SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone modes in a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multi flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Observing quantum many-body scars in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model describes quantum electrodynamics in 1+1-dimensions, it is a prototype for quantum chromodynamics, and its lattice version allows for a quantum link model description that can be simulated using modern quantum devices. In this work, we devise quantum simulations to investigate the dynamics of this model in its low dimensional form, where the gauge field degrees of freedom are described by spin 1/2 operators. We apply trotterization to write quantum circuits that effectively generate the evolution under the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. We consider both sequential circuits, with a fixed gate sequence, and randomized ones. Utilizing the correspondence between the Schwinger model and the PXP model, known for its quantum scars, we investigate the presence of quantum scar states in the Schwinger model by identifying states exhibiting extended thermalization times in our circuit evolutions. Our comparison of sequential and randomized circuit dynamics shows that the non-thermal sector of the Hilbert space, including the scars, are more sensitive to randomization.</description>
