      <title>Collision-induced mass loss and mass gain on an extremely massive star. An analytical approach and a static proto-globular cluster test-case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to analytically explore mass loss and gain induced by stellar collisions on a gas-accreting extremely massive star (aEMS, 10^3 &lt;= M/M_sun &lt;= 10^4). We also consider its contribution to the mass budget in the context of forming multiple stellar populations in a typical protoglobular cluster. We used MESA to build a series of aEMS models up to 2e4 M_sun for three [Fe/H] values, covering the metallicity range of Galactic GCs, with different treatments of super-adiabatic convection. We set analytical prescriptions to quantify collision-induced mass loss when a star spirals in and deposits energy into the envelope of the aEMS. We used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the effects of multiple collisions on an aEMS of initial mass 10^3 M_sun in a static proto-GC, accounting for mass loss and gain from collisions, gas accretion, and stellar winds. We show that assumptions on super-adiabaticity in radiation-dominated layers significantly impact aEMS properties and their collision responses: extended stars tend to lose mass, while compact ones are more likely to gain it. Our MC simulations predict total mass lost and gained, along with timescales and contributions from winds and collisions. The results depend on both the aEMS structure and the gas accretion rate during the collision phase. Under certain conditions, the EMS shows a "conveyor belt" behavior, processing up to 10^5.5 M_sun of material in 5 Myr. This study provides theoretical predictions supporting aEMSs as contributors to the abundance anomalies observed in GCs. It emphasizes the need to include collision dynamics and mass transfer in aEMS formation and evolution models in dense stellar environments. We provide a grid of predictions for stellar M-R-[Fe/H]-structure relations and collision-induced mass loss and gain, suitable for hydro and N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Intense Hard X-ray Emissions in C-class Flares: A Statistical Study with ASO-S/HXI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard model of solar eruptive events, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares are associated with each other through magnetic reconnection initiated by erupting flux ropes. Observations also reveal an increasing association ratio between flares and CMEs with flare intensity. However, the fundamental relationship between flares and CMEs, and that between thermal and nonthermal processes, remains unknown. Here we investigate energetic C-class flares (ECFs) -- Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) C-class flares with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions above 30 keV -- using observations from Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI), Solar Dynamic Observatory, and GOES. Among 1331 C-class flares detected by HXI, 127 ECFs (9.5%) were identified for statistical analysis of their properties and associations with CMEs and other flare-related features. Our statistical results reveal that ECFs have relatively shorter durations and harder spectra (the mean electron power-law index is 4.65), with no significant correlation between soft X-ray flux and nonthermal parameters (e.g., HXR peak flux). Among the 127 events, 53 (42%) were associated with type III bursts, 38 (30%) with jets, at least 13 (~11%) with 360 nm brightenings, and only 5 (~4%) with CMEs. Crucially, all five CME events were narrow CMEs associated with jets. The surprising correlation between these ECFs and CMEs suggests that noneruptive or confined magnetic field configurations in these flares may favor electron acceleration, resulting in harder X-ray spectra.We discuss the potential formation mechanisms and efficient electron acceleration processes in these atypical flares, providing valuable insights into nonstandard flare behavior.</description>

      <title>New Field OB and OBe Binaries of the SMC Wing: Observational Properties and Population Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radial velocity (RV) survey of the field OB and OBe stars of the SMC Wing. We use multi-epoch observations of 55 targets obtained with the Magellan IMACS and M2FS multi-object spectrographs to identify single- and double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We also use TESS light curves to identify new eclipsing binary candidates. We find that 10 each of our 34 OB (29\%) and 21 OBe (48\%) stars are confirmed binaries, and at least $\sim$ 6 more are candidates. Using our RV measurements, we set constraints on the companion masses, and in some cases, on periods, eccentricities and inclinations. The RV data suggest that OB binaries favor more circular orbits (mean eccentricity $\langle e\rangle = 0.08\pm 0.02$) while OBe binaries are eccentric ($\langle e\rangle = 0.45\pm 0.04$). We identify 2 candidate black hole binaries, [M2002] 77616, and 81941. We use BPASS to predict the frequencies of ejected OB and OBe stars and binaries, assuming OBe stars are binary mass gainers ejected by the companion supernova. We also predict the frequencies of black-hole, neutron-star, and stripped-star companions, and we model the distributions of primary and secondary masses, periods, eccentricities, and velocity distributions. The models are broadly consistent with the binary origin scenario for OBe stars, and predict an even larger number of post-supernova OB binaries. Comparison with the kinematics supports a significant contribution from dynamical ejections for both OB and OBe stars, although less so for binaries.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Non-Potential Magnetic Field Parameters in a Super-Active Region with Complex Structures and Strong Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the non-potential magnetic field parameters of active region NOAA 9077 are investigated; this AR experienced a super-strong X5.7 solar flare. Using advanced extrapolation techniques, the 3D magnetic field structure from vector magnetograms is obtained from the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope (SMFT) at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS). Then various non-potential parameters are calculated, including current density, shear angle, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), twist, and field line helicity. By analyzing the spatial and temporal distributions of these parameters, we aim to shed light on the relationship between magnetic field properties and solar flare occurrence. Our findings reveal that high twist and complex magnetic field configurations are prevalent before flares, while these features tend to weaken after the eruption. Additionally, we observe decreases in helicity and free energy after the flare, while the free energy peaks approximately 1.5 days prior to the onset of the flare. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution of quasi-separatrix layers and twist, finding high degrees of complexity before flares. Multiple patterns of high current density regions suggest unstable magnetic structures prone to flaring, coinciding with shear angle distribution. Relative field line helicity patterns exhibit distinct characteristics compared to current density, concentrating before flares and diverging afterward. Overall, our results highlight the contrasting nature of current density and relative field line helicity patterns in relation to solar flares, in addition to the aforementioned feature in the set of commonly derived non-potential parameters for this particular event.</description>

      <title>Formation Channels of Gravitationally Resolvable Double White Dwarf Binaries Inside Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current gravitational wave detectors are sensitive to coalescing black holes and neutron stars. However, double white dwarfs (DWDs) have long been recognized as promising sources of gravitational waves, and upcoming detectors like LISA will be able to observe these systems in abundance. DWDs are expected to be the dominant gravitational wave (GW) sources in parts of the LISA frequency range, making it crucial to understand their formation for future detections. The Milky Way contains many white dwarfs (WDs) in both the field and star clusters, promising a rich population of DWDs for LISA. However, the large number of sources may make it difficult to resolve individual binaries, and DWDs in the field and clusters often have similar properties, complicating the identification of their origins from GW signals alone. In this work, we focus on eccentric and tight DWDs, which cannot form in the field, but require dynamical interactions in dense clusters to increase their eccentricity after circularization through mass transfer phases and common-envelope evolution during binary evolution. These binaries may also form in three- and four-body dynamical interactions where a DWD binary may directly form with high eccentricity and low separation. Our results show that we should expect eccentric and tight DWDs in clusters that can provide meaningful GW signal, however, the number is low; with an upper limit of 10-15 in the MW. These can be used to independently obtain distances of their host cluster.</description>

      <title>The efficiency of mixed modes for angular momentum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core rotation rates of red-giant stars inferred from asteroseismic observations are substantially lower than predicted by current stellar models. This indicates the lack of an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism in radiative interiors. Mixed pressure-gravity modes are a promising candidate to extract angular momentum from the core of red giants. We focus on determining the effect of mixed modes on the rotation rates of stars evolving along the red giant branch (RGB). We developed a post-processing code that computes the angular momentum transport by meridional currents, shear-induced turbulence and mixed modes. Rotation rates were computed for models along the RGB with different stellar masses and different initial rotation profiles. We find that the mixed modes can explain some of the spin down observed in red giant stars, however, the values of non-radial mode amplitudes strongly affect the efficiency of this mechanism. Rotation rates from models neglecting radiative damping on the mixed mode amplitudes overlap with observations and produce a localised spin down around the hydrogen-burning shell, whereas the inclusion of radiative damping strongly suppresses and delays this spin down. We also show that including an additional viscosity term with values in the range $10^3-10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ redistributes the localised spin down due to the mixed modes, enhancing their efficiency. Our results reveal that the mixed mode amplitudes need to be constraint to precisely quantify the spin down of red giant cores. Nevertheless, the mixed mode mechanism by itself cannot explain the full spread in observed core rotation rates along the RGB. This will only be possible with an additional mechanism for angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Mass of NGC 3603-A1: the Most Massive Binary Known?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is the most massive binary in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made by a fundamental method. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</description>

      <title>Near-Eddington mass loss of hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Very massive clusters and regions of intense star formation such as the center of our Milky Way contain young, hydrogen-burning stars very close to the Eddington Limit. Formally classified as hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, the winds and spectra of these stars are distinctively different to the more evolved, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars. Results. We find an overall downward trend of the mass-loss rate with increasing temperature and decreasing metallicity. However, at SMC metallicities and above, we find a maximum in the wind efficiency with the mass-loss eventually decreasing again at lower temperatures. For intermediate metallicities, we also find strong discontinuities in the mass-loss trends, which do not appear at high or very low metallicities. For the lowest metallicities, a more homogeneous behavior is obtained without any maximum in the wind efficiency. The terminal velocities are generally higher for hotter temperatures. For cooler temperatures, the combined effect of metallicity and mass-loss change significantly reduces the changes in terminal velocity with metallicity. Conclusions. Contrary to cWR stars, the spectral appearance of late-type WNh stars rules out supersonic winds launched at the hot iron bump. Instead, a more extended quasi-hydrostatic regime is necessary. The proximity to the Eddington limit and the complex interactions cause a lot of substructure in the global wind parameter trends. While the strong discontinuities show resemblances to the bi-stability jump predicted for the B-supergiant regime, our models reveal a more complex origin. At sub-SMC metallicity, iron is no longer a major key for setting the mass-loss rate in this WNh regime. Instead, other elements (e.g. nitrogen) and continuum contributions become important.</description>

      <title>Supernova explosions of runaway stars and young neutron stars above the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several supernova remnants and young neutron stars were recently discovered relatively high above the Galactic plane. One possibility is that they originate from runaway OB stars born in the Galactic disk. Understanding their origin will provide key insights into the properties of the Galactic halo. This paper aims to determine the spatial distribution of supernova explosions from runaway OB stars and to assess whether this model can explain certain observed neutron stars. We map the distribution of supernova events produced by runaway OB stars by incorporating their birth rate, initial spatial distribution, lifetime, ejection mechanisms, and velocity distributions. By tracking their motion in the Galactic potential, we determine their final distribution right before the explosion. We show that the neutron star Calvera, which is found at z around 2.2 kpc, could have originated from a runaway OB star. In addition, we compare the probabilities of finding a supernova remnant originating from Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae high above the Galactic plane, showing that supernova remnants related to core-collapse supernovae outnumber those related to Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Luminous, rapidly declining supernovae as stripped transitional objects in low metallicity environments: the case of SN 2022lxg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $&gt;15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Hubble's Multi-Year Search for Exospheres in the TRAPPIST-1 System Reveals Frequent Microflares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ly-$\alpha$ observations provide a powerful probe of stellar activity and atmospheric escape in exoplanetary systems. We present here an analysis of 104 HST/STIS orbits monitoring the TRAPPIST-1 system between 2017 and 2022, covering 3--5 transits for each of its seven planets. We rule out transit depths $\gtrsim20\%$, which translates into an upper limit on the escape rate of $1064~EO_H$/Gyr for planet b ($1~EO_H$ is the Earth-ocean-equivalent hydrogen content), in agreement with recent claims that planet b should be airless. These upper limits are $\sim$3 times larger than expected from the photon noise due to a large baseline scatter, which we ultimately link to TRAPPIST-1's intrinsic Ly-$\alpha$ variability from frequent ``microflares.'' While JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 in the near infrared have shown that $\sim10^{30}$-erg flares occur every $\sim$6 hours, we report here $\sim10^{29}$-erg flares on sub-hour timescales in the HST/STIS and also Very Large Telescope (VLT) $g^{'}$ observations. The FUV and optical amplitudes ($\sim$400$\%$ vs $\sim$3$\%$, respectively) for flares with similar waiting-times indicate flare temperatures of 11000$^{+4200}_{-3100}$~K over 0.011$^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$\% of the stellar disk. Finally, our multi-year baseline reveals a variability with $P = 3.27 \pm 0.04$ days, providing further validation of the previously reported 3.295-day rotation period for TRAPPIST-1. These results highlight the importance of accounting for stellar microvariability when searching for exospheres around active M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Updated line list for the principal isotopologue of carbon monoxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The line list for the principal isotopologue of CO calculated earlier by the present authors [1, 2] with the irregular dipole-moment function (DMF) is updated with use of the recent high-precision measurements in the 3-0 [3, 4] (Bielska et al. 2022, Hodges et al. 2025) and 7-0 [5] (Balashov et al. 2023) bands. The new data came in contradiction with the experimental data on the 1-0 band [6, 7]. Therefore, we performed fitting several model DMFs to the modified original data set of Meshkov et al. [8] by including the new above-referenced data and by excluding the data for the 1-0 band. The updated line list is calculated with the irregular DMF. In particular, excellent agreement with recent high-level ab initio calculations on the 3-0 band [3] is emphasized and predictions for the 1-0 and 8-0 bands are outlined. In the new update of the HITRAN database [9], new high-precision measurements in the cold and hot fundamental bands are announced. When these data are published, they will be compared with the predictions of our new line list.</description>

      <title>A Far-Infrared Search for Planet Nine Using AKARI All-Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An unusual orbital element clustering of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has been observed. The most promising dynamic solution is the presence of a giant planet in the outer Solar system, Planet Nine. However, due to its extreme distance, intensive searches in optical have not been successful. We aim to find Planet Nine in the far-infrared, where it has the peak of the black body radiation, using the most sensitive all-sky far-infrared survey to date, AKARI. In contrast to optical searches, where the energy of reflected sunlight decreases by $d^{4}$, thermal radiation in the infrared decreases with the square of the heliocentric distance $d^{2}$. We search for moving objects in the AKARI Single Scan Detection List. We select sources from a promising region suggested by an N-body simulation from Millholland and Laughlin 2017: $30^{\circ}&lt;$ R.A. $&lt;50^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}&lt;$ Dec. $&lt;20^{\circ}$. Known sources are excluded by cross-matching AKARI sources with 9 optical and infrared catalogues. Furthermore, we select sources with small background strength to avoid sources in the cirrus. Since Planet Nine is stationary in a timescale of hours but moves on a monthly scale, our primary strategy is to select slowly moving objects that are stationary in 24 hours but not in six months, using multiple single scans by AKARI. The selected slowly moving AKARI sources are scrutinised for potential contamination from cosmic rays. Our analysis reveals two possible Planet Nine candidates whose positions and flux are within the theoretical prediction ranges. These candidates warrant further investigation through follow-up observations to confirm the existence and properties of Planet Nine.</description>

      <title>First detection of HS2 in a cold dark cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first detection of HS2 towards the cold dark cloud TMC-1. This is the first observation of a chemical species containing more than one sulphur atom in this type of sources. The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a line survey of TMC-1 in the Q band (31-50 GHz). The detection is confirmed by the observation of the fine and hyperfine components of two rotational transitions (2(0,2)-1(0,1) and 3(0,3)-2(0,2)). Assuming a rotational temperature of 7 K, we derived an HS2 column density of 5.7x10^11 cm-2, using a local thermodynamic equilibrium model that reproduces the observed spectra. The abundance of HS2 relative to H2 is 5.7x10^-11, which means that it is about seven times more abundant than its oxygenated counterpart HSO. We also explored the main formation and destruction mechanisms of HS2 using a chemical model, which reproduces the observed abundance of HS2 and indicates that dissociative recombination reactions from the ions H2S2+ and H3S2+ play a major role in forming HS2.</description>

      <title>Stellar initial mass function in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important astrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution for stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the main-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar neighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the definition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple corrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We present a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from \textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star population while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias, Lutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by mixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In particular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical evolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio distribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with significantly reduced uncertainties: $\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, $\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at $m_{\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Our model also constrains the binary fraction to $\sim$25\% and the \textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular resolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the $\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to compare our result with other work.</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral variability in 2S 1417-624 observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the spectral and timing analyses of the accreting X-ray pulsar, 2S 1417-624, during the 2018 and 2021 outbursts with Insight-HXMT. We find that the pulse profiles in all energy bands exhibit clear double-peaked structures at low flux states. In the 1-10 keV band, the pulse profiles evolve from double to triple peaks at a flux level of $\sim$4.1$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and from triple to quadruple peaks at $\sim$6.4$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. In the 10-30 keV and 30-100 keV bands, the pulse profiles become narrower at the first transition flux level, followed by a stark transition to quadruple-peaked and triple-peaked structures around the second flux level, respectively. The change of the pulse profile {during the second transition} reveals the transition of the emission pattern from the sub-critical (pencil beam) to the supercritical (fan beam) regime. By performing the binary orbital fitting of the observed spin periods, we provide new measurements of the orbital parameters from the 2021 outburst. Applying different accretion torque models and using the critical luminosity inferred from the pulse profile transitions, we derive a self-consistent distance of {2S 1417-624} in the range of approximately 12.0-15.0~kpc, based on the magnetic field strength derived from the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). From the estimated distance of 13 kpc and Gaia's distance of 7.4 kpc, we can infer the observed transition luminosity of \((1.0-1.4) \times 10^{38} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\) and \((3.0-5.0) \times 10^{37} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\), respectively, and compare them with theoretical models. The spectral continuum parameters and the hardness ratio also show significant transitions around the second transition, strongly supporting a change in the accretion regime.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the twin branch. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>A new approach for predicting the stability of hierarchical triple systems -- I. Coplanar Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical contexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important. Traditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the ratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's semi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is impossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable and unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we introduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this mixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical triples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital periods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main peaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous components and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be stable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more periodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the triples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution and the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible to determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very high accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can serve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.</description>

      <title>Thermo-mechanic invariant in anisotropic plasma with heat fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear perturbations in an incompressible, weakly collisional, anisotropic plasma, taking heat fluxes into account. Our analysis identifies a new class of time-invariant perturbations that encompass heat flux variations and aperiodic longitudinal perturbations in the magnetic field and flow velocity. Under the Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) approximation, which neglects low-frequency heat flux effects, these perturbations are purely thermal and decoupled from magnetic and velocity fields. When heat fluxes are included, these perturbations gain kinematic and magnetic components, leading to the identification of a ``thermo-mechanic mode.''
  The nature of aperiodic linear modes suggests that they may reach higher amplitudes in perturbation structures, that can be revealed as filamentary formations. We discuss the potential implications of these filaments on the large-scale dynamics of flows and on the nonlinear energy balance within small-scale MHD turbulence. Our findings indicate that thermo-mechanic invariant may play a significant role in modulating turbulence energy transfer dynamics, potentially impacting both local and global flow behavior in weakly collisional anisotropic plasmas.</description>

      <title>ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars (ELPIS): II. The Jupiter-like Inhomogeneous Atmosphere of the First Directly Imaged Planetary-Mass Companion 2MASS 1207 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.</description>

      <title>On the Origins of "Hostless'' Supernovae: Testing the Faint-end Galaxy Luminosity Function and Supernova Progenitors with Events in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present arguments on the likely origins of supernovae without associated host galaxies from open field, non-clustered, environments. We show why it is unlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars (HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It is highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint to be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper limits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M_V&gt;-14$, which themselves may be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV luminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\Lambda$CDM into context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and metallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that occur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: A new Galactic map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Old open clusters (OCs) can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they are affected by low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old clusters ($\geq$ 500 Myr) from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest OCs as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old OCs with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease in metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.056 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is nicely explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>
