      <title>Type IIA String Theory and tmf with Level Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at a new string$^h$ tangential structure first introduced by Devalapurkar and relate it to the $W_7=0$ condition of Diaconescu-Moore-Witten for type IIA string theory and M-theory. We show that a string$^h$ structure on the target space automatically satisfies the $W_7=0$ condition and we also explain when the $W_7=0$ condition gives rise to a string$^h$ structure. Devalapurkar initially constructed $MString^h$ in such a way that it orients $tmf_1(3)$, we extend Devalapurkar's orientation and show that $MString^h$ orients $tmf_1(n)$. We compute the homotopy groups of $MString^h$ in the dimensions relevant for physical applications, and apply them to anomaly cancellation applications for compactifications of type IIA string theory.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for symplectic groups via algebraic arc complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use algebraic arc complexes to prove a homological stability result for symplectic groups with slope 2/3 for rings with finite unitary stable rank. Symplectic groups are here interpreted as the automorphism groups of formed spaces with boundary, which are algebraic analogues of surfaces with boundary, that we also study in the present paper. Our stabilization map is a rank one stabilization in the category of formed spaces with boundary, going through both odd and even symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the apparent incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces and we give some suggestions for future works.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theory of Moore flows (III)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16174v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The previous paper of this series shows that the q-model categories of $\mathcal{G}$-multipointed $d$-spaces and of $\mathcal{G}$-flows are Quillen equivalent. In this paper, the same result is established by replacing the reparametrization category $\mathcal{G}$ by the reparametrization category $\mathcal{M}$. Unlike the case of $\mathcal{G}$, the execution paths of a cellular $\mathcal{M}$-multipointed $d$-space can have stop intervals. The technical tool to overcome this obstacle is the notion of globular naturalization. It is the globular analogue of Raussen's naturalization of a directed path in the geometric realization of a precubical set. The notion of globular naturalization working both for $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{M}$, the proof of the Quillen equivalence we obtain is valid for the two reparametrization categories. Together with the results of the first paper of this series, we then deduce that $\mathcal{G}$-multipointed $d$-spaces and $\mathcal{M}$-multipointed $d$-spaces have Quillen equivalent q-model structures. Finally, we prove that the saturation hypothesis can be added without any modification in the main theorems of the paper.</description>

      <title>The cancellation property for projective modules over integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a partial classification of the finite groups $G$ for which the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has projective cancellation, i.e. for which $P \oplus \mathbb{Z} G \cong Q \oplus \mathbb{Z} G$ implies $P \cong Q$ for projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules $P$ and $Q$. In particular, we determine when projective cancellation holds for a finite group with no exceptional binary polyhedral quotients. To do this, we prove a cancellation theorem based on a relative version of the Eichler condition. We then use a group theoretic argument to precisely determine the class of groups not covered by this result. The final classification is then obtained by applying results of Swan, Chen and Bley-Hofmann-Johnston which show failure of projective cancellation for certain groups.</description>

      <title>Scalar Function Topology Divergence: Comparing Topology of 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we show that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.</description>
