      <title>Ultra-broadband acoustic absorber based on periodic acoustic rigid-metaporous composite array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the increasingly serious issue of noise pollution, we propose an ultra-broadband and wide-angle acoustic absorber based on a periodic acoustic rigid-metaporous composite array. Numerical simulation results verify the broadband good acoustic absorption performance of the proposed absorber, which can achieve an average absorption coefficient of approximately 90.9% within the frequency band from 500 to 4000 Hz with incident angles ranging from -75 to +75 degrees, thus compensating for the shortcomings of traditional acoustic absorbers that are not as effective at low frequencies. This work will provide a new approach for ultra-broadband and wide-angle acoustic wave absorption and noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Prob-cGAN: A Probabilistic Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for LSD1 Inhibitor Activity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inhibition of Lysine-Specific Histone Demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and targeting epigenetic mechanisms. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Prob-cGAN), designed to predict the activity of LSD1 inhibitors. The Prob-cGAN was evaluated against state-of-the-art models using the ChEMBL database, demonstrating superior performance. Specifically, it achieved a top-1 $R^2$ of 0.739, significantly outperforming the Smiles-Transformer model at 0.591 and the baseline cGAN at 0.488. Furthermore, it recorded a lower $RMSE$ of 0.562, compared to 0.708 and 0.791 for the Smiles-Transformer and cGAN models respectively. These results highlight the potential of Prob-cGAN to enhance drug design and advance our understanding of complex biological systems through machine learning and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Task Scheduling for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models on Single Moderate GPU Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are known for their high demand on computing resources and memory due to their substantial model size, which leads to inefficient inference on moderate GPU systems. Techniques like quantization or pruning can shrink model sizes but often impair accuracy, making them unsuitable for practical applications. In this work, we introduce \modelname{}, a high-performance inference engine designed to speed up LLM inference without compromising model accuracy. \modelname{} incorporates three innovative methods to increase inference efficiency: 1) model partitioning to allow asynchronous processing of tasks across CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU-GPU communication, 2) an adaptive partition algorithm to optimize the use of CPU, GPU, and PCIe communication capabilities, and 3) a token assignment strategy to handle diverse prompt and generation tasks during LLM inference. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with various LLMs such as Mixtral, LLaMA-2, Qwen, and PhiMoE across three test environments featuring different CPUs and GPUs. The experimental findings demonstrate that \modelname{} achieves speeds between $1.11\times$ to $1.80\times$ faster in decoding and $1.69\times$ to $6.33\times$ faster in pre-filling, leading to an overall speedup ranging from $1.25\times$ to $2.04\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, llama.cpp and Fiddler.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity $\unicode{x2013}$ from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
  In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to the Plastic Arbor framework, supporting simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the new framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. Using the new framework, we have already been able to investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, showing a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
  By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>

      <title>Model-based reinforcement corrosion prediction: Continuous calibration with Bayesian optimization and corrosion wire sensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chloride-induced corrosion significantly contributes to the degradation of reinforced concrete structures, making accurate predictions of chloride migration and its effects on material durability critical. This paper explores two modeling approaches to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient for chloride transport. The first approach follows Gehlen's interpretable diffusion model, which is based on established physical principles and incorporates time and temperature dependencies in predicting chloride migration. The second approach is a neural network-based method, where the neural network approximates the effective diffusion coefficient. In a subsequent step, the calibrated models are used to predict the penetration depth of the critical chloride content, taking into account the uncertainty in the critical chloride content. The models are calibrated using experimental data measured by a wire sensor installed in a concrete test bridge. The calibration results are compared to effective diffusion coefficients derived from drilling dust samples. A comparison of both approaches reveals the advantages of the physics-based model in terms of transparency and interpretability, while the neural network model demonstrates flexibility and adaptability in data-driven predictions. This study emphasizes the importance of combining traditional and machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of chloride migration predictions in reinforced concrete.</description>

      <title>Deriving Analytical Solutions Using Symbolic Matrix Structural Analysis: Part 2 -- Plane Trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the use of symbolic computation in Matrix Structural Analysis (MSA) to plane (2D) trusses, building on previous work that focused on continuous beams. An open-source MATLAB program, hosted on GitHub, was developed to perform symbolic analysis of 2D trusses under point loads for any configuration. Using MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox, the program derives analytical expressions for displacements, support reactions, and axial forces, providing a deeper understanding of truss behavior. The symbolic approach also supports efficient and scalable sensitivity analysis by directly computing partial derivatives of outputs with respect to input parameters, enhancing design exploration and optimization. This tool serves as a valuable resource for both engineering practice and education, offering clear insights into parameter relationships and enriching the understanding of structural mechanics. The accuracy of the symbolic results has been rigorously validated against two commercial finite element software programs and results from the literature, with full agreement, confirming the validity and generality of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Location-Based Service (LBS) Data Quality Metrics and Effects on Mobility Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, GPS-equipped mobile devices are ubiquitous, and they generate Location-Based Service (LBS) data, which has become a critical resource for understanding human mobility. However, inherent limitations in LBS datasets, primarily characterized by discontinuity and sparsity, may introduce significant biases in representing individual movement patterns. This study develops data quality metrics for LBS data, examines their disparities among different populations, and quantifies their effects on inferred individual movement, stays in particular, in the Boston Metropolitan Area. We find that data from higher-income, more educated, and predominantly white census block groups (CBGs) show higher sampling rates but paradoxically lower data quality. This contradiction may stem from greater privacy awareness in these communities. Additionally, we propose a new framework to resample LBS data and quantitatively evaluate the inferential biases associated with data of varying quality. This versatile framework can analyze the impacts originating from different data processing workflows with LBS data. Using linear regression models with clustered standard error, we assess the impact of data quality metrics on inferring the number of stay points. The results show that better data quality, characterized by the number of observations and temporal occupancy, can significantly reduce the bias when calculating the stay points of an individual. The introduction of additional data quality metrics into the regression model can further explain the bias. Overall, this study provides insights into how data quality can influence our understanding of human mobility patterns, highlighting the importance of carefully handling LBS data in research.</description>

      <title>Limeade: Let integer molecular encoding aid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a well-established framework for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</description>

      <title>RAMIE: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-task Information Extraction with Large Language Models on Dietary Supplements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Objective:} We aimed to develop an advanced multi-task large language model (LLM) framework to extract multiple types of information about dietary supplements (DS) from clinical records.
  \textbf{Methods:} We used four core DS information extraction tasks - namely, named entity recognition (NER: 2,949 clinical sentences), relation extraction (RE: 4,892 sentences), triple extraction (TE: 2,949 sentences), and usage classification (UC: 2,460 sentences) as our multitasks. We introduced a novel Retrieval-Augmented Multi-task Information Extraction (RAMIE) Framework, including: 1) employed instruction fine-tuning techniques with task-specific prompts, 2) trained LLMs for multiple tasks with improved storage efficiency and lower training costs, and 3) incorporated retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) techniques by retrieving similar examples from the training set. We compared RAMIE's performance to LLMs with instruction fine-tuning alone and conducted an ablation study to assess the contributions of multi-task learning and RAG to improved multitasking performance.
  \textbf{Results:} With the aid of the RAMIE framework, Llama2-13B achieved an F1 score of 87.39 (3.51\% improvement) on the NER task and demonstrated outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\% improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement), and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied to other domains.</description>

      <title>Lattice $\phi^{4}$ field theory as a multi-agent system of financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory with frustrated dynamics as a multi-agent system to reproduce stylized facts of financial markets such as fat-tailed distributions of returns and clustered volatility. Each lattice site, represented by a continuous degree of freedom, corresponds to an agent experiencing a set of competing interactions which influence its decision to buy or sell a given stock. These interactions comprise a cooperative term, which signifies that the agent should imitate the behavior of its neighbors, and a fictitious field, which compels the agent instead to conform with the opinion of the majority or the minority. To introduce the competing dynamics we exploit the Markov field structure to pursue a constructive decomposition of the $\phi^{4}$ probability distribution which we recompose with a Ferrenberg-Swendsen acceptance or rejection sampling step. We then verify numerically that the multi-agent $\phi^{4}$ field theory produces behavior observed on empirical data from the FTSE 100 London Stock Exchange index. We conclude by discussing how the presence of continuous degrees of freedom within the $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory enables a representational capacity beyond that possible with multi-agent systems derived from Ising models.</description>

      <title>Free Vibration analysis of Curvilinearly Stiffened Composite plates with an arbitrarily shaped cutout using Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the isogeometric vibration analysis of curvilinearly stiffened composite panels. The stiffness matrices and the mass matrices are derived using the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The present method models the plate and the stiffener separately, which allows the stiffener element nodes to not coincide with the plate shell-element nodes. The stiffness and mass matrices of a stiffener are transformed to those of the plate through the displacement compatibility conditions at the plate/stiffener interface by interpolation using NURBS basis functions. Cutouts are modeled using a single NURBS patch generated by creating a ruled surface between two curves. The proposed formulation is first validated by comparing it with available literature. The effects of width-to-thickness ratio, fiber orientation, ply layups, shape and size of the cutouts and the boundary conditions on the response of stiffened composite plates are then analyzed and the numerical results are used to derive useful conclusions.</description>

      <title>Vibration Analysis of Timoshenko Beams using Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the finite free-form beam element is formulated by the isogeometric approach based on the Timoshenko beam theory to investigate the free vibration behavior of the beams. The non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) functions which define the geometry of the beam are used as the basis functions for the finite element analysis. In order to enrich the basis functions and to increase the accuracy of the solution fields, the h-, p-, and k-refinement techniques are implemented. The geometry and curvature of the beams are modelled in a unique way based on NURBS. All the effects of the the shear deformation, and the rotary inertia are taken into consideration by the present isogeometric model. Results of the beams for non-dimensional frequencies are compared with other available results in order to show the accuracy and efficiency of the present isogeometric approach. From numerical results, the present element can produce very accurate values of natural frequencies and the mode shapes due to exact definition of the geometry. With higher order basis functions, there is no shear locking phenomenon in very thin beam situations. Finally, the benchmark tests described in this study are provided as future reference solutions for Timoshenko beam vibration problem.</description>

      <title>A Generic Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problem with the Vehicle Sharing and Drop-off and Pick-up Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new generic problem to the literature of Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problem. In this problem, multiple workers are assigned to a shared vehicle based on their qualifications and customer demands, and then the route is formed so that a traveler may be dropped off and picked up later to minimize total flow time. We introduced a mixed-integer linear programming model for the problem. To solve the problem, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm was developed with problem-specific heuristics and a decomposition-based constructive upper bound algorithm (UBA). To analyze the impact of newly introduced policies, service area, difficulty of service, distribution of care, and number of demand nodes type instance characteristics are considered. The empirical analyses showed that the ALNS algorithm presents solutions with up to 35% less total flow time than the UBA. The implementation of the proposed drop-off and pick-up (DP) and vehicle sharing policies present up to 24% decrease in total flow time or provide savings on the total cost of service especially when the demand nodes are located in small areas like in urban areas.</description>

      <title>Regression-based Physics Informed Neural Networks (Reg-PINNs) for Magnetopause Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09621v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research in the scientific field has utilized statistical empirical models and machine learning to address fitting challenges. While empirical models have the advantage of numerical generalization, they often sacrifice accuracy. However, conventional machine learning methods can achieve high precision but may lack the desired generalization. The article introduces a Regression-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Reg-PINNs), which embeds physics-inspired empirical models into the neural network's loss function, thereby combining the benefits of generalization and high accuracy. The study validates the proposed method using the magnetopause boundary location as the target and explores the feasibility of methods including Shue et al. [1998], a data overfitting model, a fully-connected networks, Reg-PINNs with Shue's model, and Reg-PINNs with the overfitting model. Compared to Shue's model, this technique achieves approximately a 30% reduction in RMSE, presenting a proof-of-concept improved solution for the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Rational kernel-based interpolation for complex-valued frequency response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the kernel-based approximation of a complex-valued function from data, where the frequency response function of a partial differential equation in the frequency domain is of particular interest. In this setting, kernel methods are employed more and more frequently, however, standard kernels do not perform well. Moreover, the role and mathematical implications of the underlying pair of kernels, which arises naturally in the complex-valued case, remain to be addressed. We introduce new reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of complex-valued functions, and formulate the problem of complex-valued interpolation with a kernel pair as minimum norm interpolation in these spaces. Moreover, we combine the interpolant with a low-order rational function, where the order is adaptively selected based on a new model selection criterion. Numerical results on examples from different fields, including electromagnetics and acoustic examples, illustrate the performance of the method, also in comparison to available rational approximation methods.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Entity Representation for Medicinal Synergy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medicinal synergy prediction is a powerful tool in drug discovery and development that harnesses the principles of combination therapy to enhance therapeutic outcomes by improving efficacy, reducing toxicity, and preventing drug resistance. While a myriad of computational methods has emerged for predicting synergistic drug combinations, a large portion of them may overlook the intricate, yet critical relationships between various entities in drug interaction networks, such as drugs, cell lines, and diseases. These relationships are complex and multidimensional, requiring sophisticated modeling to capture nuanced interplay that can significantly influence therapeutic efficacy. We introduce a salient deep hypergraph learning method, namely, Heterogeneous Entity Representation for MEdicinal Synergy prediction (HERMES), to predict anti-cancer drug synergy. HERMES integrates heterogeneous data sources, encompassing drug, cell line, and disease information, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions involved. By leveraging advanced hypergraph neural networks with gated residual mechanisms, HERMES can effectively learn complex relationships/interactions within the data. Our results show HERMES demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, particularly in forecasting new drug combinations, significantly surpassing previous methods. This advancement underscores the potential of HERMES to facilitate more effective and precise drug combination predictions, thereby enhancing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Turing Test: Can GPT-4 Sway Experts' Decisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers. We release our dataset to assist future research.</description>

      <title>D-Flow: Multi-modality Flow Matching for D-peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10618</link>

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in biological processes, with therapeutic peptides emerging as promising pharmaceutical agents. They allow new possibilities to leverage target binding sites that were previously undruggable. While deep learning (DL) has advanced peptide discovery, generating D-proteins composed of D-amino acids remains challenging due to the scarcity of natural examples. This paper proposes D-Flow, a full-atom flow-based framework for {de novo} D-peptide design. D-Flow is conditioned on receptor binding and utilizes a comprehensive representation of peptide structure, incorporating backbone frames, side-chain angles, and discrete amino acid types. A mirror-image algorithm is implemented to address the lack of training data for D-proteins, which converts L-receptors' chirality. Furthermore, we enhance D-Flow's capacity by integrating large protein language models (PLMs) with structural awareness through a lightweight structural adapter. A two-stage training pipeline and a controlling toolkit also enable D-Flow to transition from general protein design to targeted binder design while preserving pretraining knowledge.
  Extensive experimental results on the PepMerge benchmark demonstrate D-Flow's effectiveness, particularly in developing peptides with entire D-residues. This approach represents a significant advancement in computational D-peptide design, offering unique opportunities for bioorthogonal and stable molecular tools and diagnostics. The code is available in~\url{https://github.com/smiles724/PeptideDesign}.</description>

      <title>Prior Biological Knowledge And Epigenetic Information Enhances Prediction Accuracy Of Bayesian Wnt Pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4296</link>
      <description>arXiv:1307.4296v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational modeling of Wnt signaling pathway has gained prominence for its use as computer aided diagnostic tool to develop therapeutic cancer target drugs and predict of test samples as cancerous and non cancerous. This manuscript focuses on development of simple static bayesian network models of varying complexity that encompasses prior partially available biological knowledge about intra and extra cellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway and incorporates epigenetic information like methylation and histone modification of a few genes known to have inhibitory affect on Wnt pathway. It might be expected that such models not only increase cancer prediction accuracies and also form basis for understanding Wnt signaling activity in different states of tumorigenesis. Initial results in human colorectal cancer cases indicate that incorporation of epigenetic information increases prediction accuracy of test samples as being tumorous or normal. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) and their respective area under the curve (AUC) measurements, obtained from predictions of state of test sample and corresponding predictions of the state of activation of transcription complex of the Wnt pathway for the test sample, indicate that there is significant difference between the Wnt pathway being on (off) and its association with the sample being tumorous (normal). Two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirm the statistical deviation between the distributions of these predictions. At a preliminary stage, use of these models may help in understanding the yet unknown effect of certain factors like DKK2, DKK3-1 and SFRP-2/3/5 on {\beta}-catenin transcription complex.</description>

      <title>AI in Supply Chain Risk Assessment: A Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) has witnessed a profound evolution through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, revolutionizing predictive capabilities and risk mitigation strategies. The significance of this evolution stems from the critical role of robust risk management strategies in ensuring operational resilience and continuity within modern supply chains. Previous reviews have outlined established methodologies but have overlooked emerging AI/ML techniques, leaving a notable research gap in understanding their practical implications within SCRA. This paper conducts a systematic literature review combined with a comprehensive bibliometric analysis. We meticulously examined 1,439 papers and derived key insights from a select group of 51 articles published between 2015 and 2024. The review fills this research gap by addressing pivotal research questions and exploring existing AI/ML techniques, methodologies, findings, and future trajectories, thereby providing a more encompassing view of the evolving landscape of SCRA. Our study unveils the transformative impact of AI/ML models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and hybrids, in substantially enhancing precision within SCRA. It underscores adaptable post-COVID strategies, advocating for resilient contingency plans and aligning with evolving risk landscapes. Significantly, this review surpasses previous examinations by accentuating emerging AI/ML techniques and their practical implications within SCRA. Furthermore, it highlights the contributions through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, revealing publication trends, influential authors, and highly cited articles.</description>

      <title>A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>
