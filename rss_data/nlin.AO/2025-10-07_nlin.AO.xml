      <title>Collective dynamics on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions that nonlinearly couple more than two nodes are ubiquitous in networked systems. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of dynamical systems with higher-order interactions, and of the techniques which can be used to describe and analyze them. We focus in particular on new phenomena that emerge when nonpairwise interactions are considered. We conclude by discussing open questions and promising future directions on the collective dynamics of higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Swarmalators with frequency-weighted interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of frequency-weighted interactions in a solvable model of one-dimensional (1D) swarmalators confined to a ring, where both spatial and phase couplings are scaled by the heterogeneous natural frequencies of individual agents. Our analysis identifies three distinct collective states: the asynchronous state , the phase-wave state , and the bistrip mixed state characterized by antipodal clusters that are internally split into frequency-dependent sub-strips. We further establish that the onset of abrupt transitions are driven by heterogeneous coupling. Using a self-consistency analysis, we precisely determine the conditions for dynamical transitions among the identified states, thereby extending the theoretical understanding of swarmalator dynamics under heterogeneous interaction rules, which are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Growing-Dividing Autocatalytic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize the structure of a class of mathematical models of growing-dividing autocatalytic systems demonstrating that self-reproduction emerges only if the system's 'growth dynamics' and 'division strategy' are mutually compatible. Using various models in this class (the linear Hinshelwood cycle and nonlinear coarse-grained models of protocells and bacteria), we show that depending on the chosen division mechanism, the same chemical system can exhibit either (i) balanced exponential growth, (ii) balanced nonexponential growth, or (iii) system death (where the system either explodes to infinity or collapses to zero in successive generations). We identify the class of division processes that lead to these three outcomes, offering strategies to stabilize or destabilize growing-dividing systems. Our work provides a geometric framework to further explore growing-dividing systems and will aid in the design of self-reproducing synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>

      <title>Binary Option Market Manipulation by Influencing Belief Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques from information geometry, we construct a semi-Hamiltonian system modelling trader beliefs in a binary asset market and study the impact of inequality or asymmetry in beliefs, information, and power on price dynamics. We show that in a market with no inequality and $N$ completely symmetric traders, the resulting dynamics evolve on a $2N + 1$ dimensional manifold consisting of a $2N-2$ dimensional centre manifold, a $2$ dimensional stable manifold and a $1$ dimensional slow manifold. Introducing asymmetry into the traders has the potential to decrease the dimension of the centre manifold, which we prove using a parameter analysis. Using the belief model, we also study the impact of inter-agent communication, exogenous information and asymmetric purchasing power on price dynamics, showing that market bubbles can emerge when powerful traders produce outsize influence in the market, thus impacting other traders' beliefs as well as the price. This process is exacerbated when back-channel communication is permitted. The impact of areas of high curvature in belief space is also discussed.</description>

      <title>How many more is different?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Complete Synchronization and Pattern Selection through Amplitude Dynamics and Diffusion in Heterogeneous Oscillatory Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an intricate mechanism of pattern formation in globally coupled heterogeneous oscillatory media. In anodic electrochemical etching of silicon, the electrode surface splits into two amplitude-phase regions, while all oscillators remain frequency-locked. Additionally, the relative ratio of the pattern can be tuned via a coupling term. We introduce a heterogeneous, complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with global coupling to reproduce these patterns and study their formation. Neglecting diffusion shows that frequency entrainment arises from amplitude adaptation. Diffusion, on the other hand, enforces the selection of a unique cluster ratio. In quantitative agreement with simulations, a center-manifold reduction yields a Lyapunov functional that predicts the selected ratio. Both of these results establish a theoretical framework that connects experiment and theory. Moreover, they show how heterogeneity and diffusion convert degenerate cluster dynamics into robust pattern selection.</description>
