      <title>Hear Me, See Me, Understand Me: Audio-Visual Autism Behavior Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel problem of audio-visual autism behavior recognition, which includes social behavior recognition, an essential aspect previously omitted in AI-assisted autism screening research. We define the task at hand as one that is audio-visual autism behavior recognition, which uses audio and visual cues, including any speech present in the audio, to recognize autism-related behaviors. To facilitate this new research direction, we collected an audio-visual autism spectrum dataset (AV-ASD), currently the largest video dataset for autism screening using a behavioral approach. It covers an extensive range of autism-associated behaviors, including those related to social communication and interaction. To pave the way for further research on this new problem, we intensively explored leveraging foundation models and multimodal large language models across different modalities. Our experiments on the AV-ASD dataset demonstrate that integrating audio, visual, and speech modalities significantly enhances the performance in autism behavior recognition. Additionally, we explored the use of a post-hoc to ad-hoc pipeline in a multimodal large language model to investigate its potential to augment the model's explanatory capability during autism behavior recognition. We will release our dataset, code, and pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Less Peaky and More Accurate CTC Forced Alignment by Label Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) models are known to have peaky output distributions. Such behavior is not a problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but it can cause inaccurate forced alignments (FA), especially at finer granularity, e.g., phoneme level. This paper aims at alleviating the peaky behavior for CTC and improve its suitability for forced alignment generation, by leveraging label priors, so that the scores of alignment paths containing fewer blanks are boosted and maximized during training. As a result, our CTC model produces less peaky posteriors and is able to more accurately predict the offset of the tokens besides their onset. It outperforms the standard CTC model and a heuristics-based approach for obtaining CTC's token offset timestamps by 12-40% in phoneme and word boundary errors (PBE and WBE) measured on the Buckeye and TIMIT data. Compared with the most widely used FA toolkit Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), our method performs similarly on PBE/WBE on Buckeye, yet falls behind MFA on TIMIT. Nevertheless, our method has a much simpler training pipeline and better runtime efficiency. Our training recipe and pretrained model are released in TorchAudio.</description>

      <title>Breaking Walls: Pioneering Automatic Speech Recognition for Central Kurdish: End-to-End Transformer Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), as an interesting field of speech processing, is utilized in real applications and is implemented using various techniques amongst which the artificial neural network is the most popular. Increasing the performance, making these systems robust to noise and developing this technology for low-resource languages is among the current challenges. This paper addresses the development of an ASR system for the Central Kurdish language (CKB), as a low-resource language, using end to end transformers. Kurdish, as an Indo-European language, is categorized into three main dialects, i.e., Central Kurdish (i.e., Sorani), North Kurdish (Kirmanji), and South Kurdish which is spoken by more than 30 million people. In this research, a speech corpus of size 224 hours is collected using various sources. Then, this corpus is used to train the transformer-based acoustic model. A transfer learning technique is also utilized in training acoustic models. As a result of these efforts, our optimal model attains state-of-the-art results on the Asosoft test set, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13%. This accomplishment signifies a notable advancement in ASR technology for the Central Kurdish language, particularly in the context of low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Gated Low-rank Adaptation for personalized Code-Switching Automatic Speech Recognition on the low-spec devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, there has been a growing interest in utilizing personalized large models on low-spec devices, such as mobile and CPU-only devices. However, utilizing a personalized large model in the on-device is inefficient, and sometimes limited due to computational cost. To tackle the problem, this paper presents the weights separation method to minimize on-device model weights using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Moreover, some people speak multiple languages in an utterance, as known as code-switching, the personalized ASR model is necessary to address such cases. However, current multilingual speech recognition models are limited to recognizing a single language within each utterance. To tackle this problem, we propose code-switching speech recognition models that incorporate fine-tuned monolingual and multilingual speech recognition models. Additionally, we introduce a gated low-rank adaptation(GLoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal performance degradation. Our experiments, conducted on Korean-English code-switching datasets, demonstrate that fine-tuning speech recognition models for code-switching surpasses the performance of traditional code-switching speech recognition models trained from scratch. Furthermore, GLoRA enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning performance compared to conventional LoRA.</description>

      <title>A cost minimization approach to fix the vocabulary size in a tokenizer for an End-to-End ASR system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike hybrid speech recognition systems where the use of tokens was restricted to phones, biphones or triphones the choice of tokens in the end-to-end ASR systems is derived from the text corpus of the training data. The use of tokenization algorithms like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece is popular in identifying the tokens that are used in the overall training process of the speech recognition system. Popular toolkits, like ESPNet use a pre-defined vocabulary size (number of tokens) for these tokenization algorithms, but there is no discussion on how vocabulary size was derived. In this paper, we build a cost function, assuming the tokenization process to be a black-box to enable choosing the number of tokens which might most benefit building an end-to-end ASR. We show through experiments on LibriSpeech 100 hour set that the performance of an end-to-end ASR system improves when the number of tokens are chosen carefully.</description>

      <title>Combining X-Vectors and Bayesian Batch Active Learning: Two-Stage Active Learning Pipeline for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emphasizing a data-centric AI approach, this paper introduces a novel two-stage active learning (AL) pipeline for automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining unsupervised and supervised AL methods. The first stage utilizes unsupervised AL by using x-vectors clustering for diverse sample selection from unlabeled speech data, thus establishing a robust initial dataset for the subsequent supervised AL. The second stage incorporates a supervised AL strategy, with a batch AL method specifically developed for ASR, aimed at selecting diverse and informative batches of samples. Here, sample diversity is also achieved using x-vectors clustering, while the most informative samples are identified using a Bayesian AL method tailored for ASR with an adaptation of Monte Carlo dropout to approximate Bayesian inference. This approach enables precise uncertainty estimation, thereby enhancing ASR model training with significantly reduced data requirements. Our method has shown superior performance compared to competing methods on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and OOD test sets, demonstrating that strategic sample selection and innovative Bayesian modeling can substantially optimize both labeling effort and data utilization in deep learning-based ASR applications.</description>

      <title>Cluster-to-Predict Affect Contours from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous emotion recognition (CER) aims to track the dynamic changes in a person's emotional state over time. This paper proposes a novel approach to translating CER into a prediction problem of dynamic affect-contour clusters from speech, where the affect-contour is defined as the contour of annotated affect attributes in a temporal window. Our approach defines a cluster-to-predict (C2P) framework that learns affect-contour clusters, which are predicted from speech with higher precision. To achieve this, C2P runs an unsupervised iterative optimization process to learn affect-contour clusters by minimizing both clustering loss and speech-driven affect-contour prediction loss. Our objective findings demonstrate the value of speech-driven clustering for both arousal and valence attributes. Experiments conducted on the RECOLA dataset yielded promising classification results, with F1 scores of 0.84 for arousal and 0.75 for valence in our four-class speech-driven affect-contour prediction model.</description>

      <title>Selfsupervised learning for pathological speech detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech production is a complex phenomenon, wherein the brain orchestrates a sequence of processes involving thought processing, motor planning, and the execution of articulatory movements. However, this intricate execution of various processes is susceptible to influence and disruption by various neurodegenerative pathological speech disorders, such as Parkinsons' disease, resulting in dysarthria, apraxia, and other conditions. These disorders lead to pathological speech characterized by abnormal speech patterns and imprecise articulation. Diagnosing these speech disorders in clinical settings typically involves auditory perceptual tests, which are time-consuming, and the diagnosis can vary among clinicians based on their experiences, biases, and cognitive load during the diagnosis. Additionally, unlike neurotypical speakers, patients with speech pathologies or impairments are unable to access various virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, etc. To address these challenges, several automatic pathological speech detection (PSD) approaches have been proposed. These approaches aim to provide efficient and accurate detection of speech disorders, thereby facilitating timely intervention and support for individuals affected by these conditions. These approaches mainly vary in two aspects: the input representations utilized and the classifiers employed. Due to the limited availability of data, the performance of detection remains subpar. Self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as wav2vec2, and their multilingual versions, are being explored as a promising avenue to improve performance. These embeddings leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract rich representations from audio data, thereby offering a potential solution to address the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled data.</description>

      <title>PPINtonus: Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using Deep-Learning Tonal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PPINtonus is a system for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) utilizing deep-learning tonal analysis, providing a cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional neurological examinations. Partnering with the Parkinson's Voice Project (PVP), PPINtonus employs a semi-supervised conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data points, enhancing the training dataset for a multi-layered deep neural network. Combined with PRAAT phonetics software, this network accurately assesses biomedical voice measurement values from a simple 120-second vocal test performed with a standard microphone in typical household noise conditions. The model's performance was validated using a confusion matrix, achieving an impressive 92.5 \% accuracy with a low false negative rate. PPINtonus demonstrated a precision of 92.7 \%, making it a reliable tool for early PD detection. The non-intrusive and efficient methodology of PPINtonus can significantly benefit developing countries by enabling early diagnosis and improving the quality of life for millions of PD patients through timely intervention and management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has made significant progress in recent years, providing accurate transcription across various domains. However, some challenges remain, especially in noisy environments and specialized jargon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improved jargon word recognition by contextual biasing Whisper-based models. We employ a keyword spotting model that leverages the Whisper encoder representation to dynamically generate prompts for guiding the decoder during the transcription process. We introduce two approaches to effectively steer the decoder towards these prompts: KG-Whisper, which is aimed at fine-tuning the Whisper decoder, and KG-Whisper-PT, which learns a prompt prefix. Our results show a significant improvement in the recognition accuracy of specified keywords and in reducing the overall word error rates. Specifically, in unseen language generalization, we demonstrate an average WER improvement of 5.1% over Whisper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Always-on machine learning models require a very low memory and compute footprint. Their restricted parameter count limits the model's capacity to learn, and the effectiveness of the usual training algorithms to find the best parameters. Here we show that a small convolutional model can be better trained by first refactoring its computation into a larger redundant multi-branched architecture. Then, for inference, we algebraically re-parameterize the trained model into the single-branched form with fewer parameters for a lower memory footprint and compute cost. Using this technique, we show that our always-on wake-word detector model, RepCNN, provides a good trade-off between latency and accuracy during inference. RepCNN re-parameterized models are 43% more accurate than a uni-branch convolutional model while having the same runtime. RepCNN also meets the accuracy of complex architectures like BC-ResNet, while having 2x lesser peak memory usage and 10x faster runtime.</description>

      <title>ConPCO: Preserving Phoneme Characteristics for Automatic Pronunciation Assessment Leveraging Contrastive Ordinal Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) manages to evaluate the pronunciation proficiency of a second language (L2) learner in a target language. Existing efforts typically draw on regression models for proficiency score prediction, where the models are trained to estimate target values without explicitly accounting for phoneme-awareness in the feature space. In this paper, we propose a contrastive phonemic ordinal regularizer (ConPCO) tailored for regression-based APA models to generate more phoneme-discriminative features while considering the ordinal relationships among the regression targets. The proposed ConPCO first aligns the phoneme representations of an APA model and textual embeddings of phonetic transcriptions via contrastive learning. Afterward, the phoneme characteristics are retained by regulating the distances between inter- and intra-phoneme categories in the feature space while allowing for the ordinal relationships among the output targets. We further design and develop a hierarchical APA model to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset suggest the feasibility and efficacy of our approach in relation to some cutting-edge baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale universal speech models (USM) are already used in production. However, as the model size grows, the serving cost grows too. Serving cost of large models is dominated by model size that is why model size reduction is an important research topic. In this work we are focused on model size reduction using weights only quantization. We present the weights binarization of USM Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) and show that its model size can be reduced by 15.9x times at cost of word error rate (WER) increase by only 1.9% in comparison to the float32 model. It makes it attractive for practical applications.</description>

      <title>SYN2REAL: Leveraging Task Arithmetic for Mitigating Synthetic-Real Discrepancies in ASR Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the 'task vector' concept, which has significantly impacted various domains but remains underexplored in speech recognition. This paper presents a novel 'SYN2REAL' task vector for domain adaptation in automatic speech recognition (ASR), specifically targeting text-only domains. Traditional fine-tuning on synthetic speech often results in performance degradation due to acoustic mismatches. To address this issue, we propose creating a 'SYN2REAL' vector by subtracting the parameter differences between models fine-tuned on real and synthetic speech. This vector effectively bridges the gap between the two domains. Experiments on the SLURP dataset demonstrate that our approach yields an average improvement of 11.15% in word error rate for unseen target domains, highlighting the potential of task vectors in enhancing speech domain adaptation.</description>

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) can be classified into several network architectures, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), attention-based encoder-decoder, and mask-predict models. Each network architecture has advantages and disadvantages, leading practitioners to switch between these different models depending on application requirements. Instead of building separate models, we propose a joint modeling scheme where four decoders (CTC, RNN-T, attention, and mask-predict) share the same encoder -- we refer to this as 4D modeling. The 4D model is trained using multitask learning, which will bring model regularization and maximize the model robustness thanks to their complementary properties. To efficiently train the 4D model, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that stabilizes multitask learning. In addition, we propose three novel one-pass beam search algorithms by combining three decoders (CTC, RNN-T, and attention) to further improve performance. These three beam search algorithms differ in which decoder is used as the primary decoder. We carefully evaluate the performance and computational tradeoffs associated with each algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the jointly trained 4D model outperforms the E2E-ASR models trained with only one individual decoder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed one-pass beam search algorithm outperforms the previously proposed CTC/attention decoding.</description>

      <title>Singing Voice Graph Modeling for SingFake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting singing voice deepfakes, or SingFake, involves determining the authenticity and copyright of a singing voice. Existing models for speech deepfake detection have struggled to adapt to unseen attacks in this unique singing voice domain of human vocalization. To bridge the gap, we present a groundbreaking SingGraph model. The model synergizes the capabilities of the MERT acoustic music understanding model for pitch and rhythm analysis with the wav2vec2.0 model for linguistic analysis of lyrics. Additionally, we advocate for using RawBoost and beat matching techniques grounded in music domain knowledge for singing voice augmentation, thereby enhancing SingFake detection performance. Our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results within the SingFake dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA model across three distinct scenarios: it improves EER relatively for seen singers by 13.2%, for unseen singers by 24.3%, and unseen singers using different codecs by 37.1%.</description>

      <title>RevRIR: Joint Reverberant Speech and Room Impulse Response Embedding using Contrastive Learning with Application to Room Shape Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on room fingerprinting, a task involving the analysis of an audio recording to determine the specific volume and shape of the room in which it was captured. While it is relatively straightforward to determine the basic room parameters from the Room Impulse Responses (RIR), doing so from a speech signal is a cumbersome task. To address this challenge, we introduce a dual-encoder architecture that facilitates the estimation of room parameters directly from speech utterances. During pre-training, one encoder receives the RIR while the other processes the reverberant speech signal. A contrastive loss function is employed to embed the speech and the acoustic response jointly. In the fine-tuning stage, the specific classification task is trained. In the test phase, only the reverberant utterance is available, and its embedding is used for the task of room shape classification. The proposed scheme is extensively evaluated using simulated acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Once more Diarization: Improving meeting transcription systems through segment-level speaker reassignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diarization is a crucial component in meeting transcription systems to ease the challenges of speech enhancement and attribute the transcriptions to the correct speaker. Particularly in the presence of overlapping or noisy speech, these systems have problems reliably assigning the correct speaker labels, leading to a significant amount of speaker confusion errors. We propose to add segment-level speaker reassignment to address this issue. By revisiting, after speech enhancement, the speaker attribution for each segment, speaker confusion errors from the initial diarization stage are significantly reduced. Through experiments across different system configurations and datasets, we further demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability in various domains. Our results show that segment-level speaker reassignment successfully rectifies at least 40% of speaker confusion word errors, highlighting its potential for enhancing diarization accuracy in meeting transcription systems.</description>

      <title>CoLLAB: A Collaborative Approach for Multilingual Abuse Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate representations from paralingual Pre-Trained model (PTM) for Audio Abuse Detection (AAD), which has not been explored for AAD. Our results demonstrate their superiority compared to other PTM representations on the ADIMA benchmark. Furthermore, combining PTM representations enhances AAD performance. Despite these improvements, challenges with cross-lingual generalizability still remain, and certain languages require training in the same language. This demands individual models for different languages, leading to scalability, maintenance, and resource allocation issues and hindering the practical deployment of AAD systems in linguistically diverse real-world environments. To address this, we introduce CoLLAB, a novel framework that doesn't require training and allows seamless merging of models trained in different languages through weight-averaging. This results in a unified model with competitive AAD performance across multiple languages.</description>

      <title>Reference Channel Selection by Multi-Channel Masking for End-to-End Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In end-to-end multi-channel speech enhancement, the traditional approach of designating one microphone signal as the reference for processing may not always yield optimal results. The limitation is particularly in scenarios with large distributed microphone arrays with varying speaker-to-microphone distances or compact, highly directional microphone arrays where speaker or microphone positions change over time. Current mask-based methods often fix the reference channel during training, which makes it not possible to adaptively select the reference channel for optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an adaptive approach for selecting the optimal reference channel. Our method leverages a multi-channel masking-based scheme, where multiple masked signals are combined to generate a single-channel output signal. This enhanced signal is then used for loss calculation, while the reference clean speech is adjusted based on the highest scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR). The experimental results on the Spear challenge simulated dataset D4 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the conventional approach of using a fixed reference channel with single-channel masking</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most emotion recognition systems fail in real-life situations (in the wild scenarios) where the audio is contaminated by reverberation. Our study explores new methods to alleviate the performance degradation of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) algorithms and develop a more robust system for adverse conditions. We propose processing multi-microphone signals to address these challenges and improve emotion classification accuracy. We adopt a state-of-the-art transformer model, the Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), to handle multi-channel audio inputs. We evaluate two strategies: averaging mel-spectrograms across channels and summing patch-embedded representations. Our multimicrophone model achieves superior performance compared to single-channel baselines when tested on real-world reverberant environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CTC-based speech recognition with diverse modeling units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models has been remarkable, largely due to advances in deep learning architectures like transformer. On top of E2E systems, researchers have achieved substantial accuracy improvement by rescoring E2E model's N-best hypotheses with a phoneme-based model. This raises an interesting question about where the improvements come from other than the system combination effect. We examine the underlying mechanisms driving these gains and propose an efficient joint training approach, where E2E models are trained jointly with diverse modeling units. This methodology does not only align the strengths of both phoneme and grapheme-based models but also reveals that using these diverse modeling units in a synergistic way can significantly enhance model accuracy. Our findings offer new insights into the optimal integration of heterogeneous modeling units in the development of more robust and accurate ASR systems.</description>

      <title>The PESQetarian: On the Relevance of Goodhart's Law for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To obtain improved speech enhancement models, researchers often focus on increasing performance according to specific instrumental metrics. However, when the same metric is used in a loss function to optimize models, it may be detrimental to aspects that the given metric does not see. The goal of this paper is to illustrate the risk of overfitting a speech enhancement model to the metric used for evaluation. For this, we introduce enhancement models that exploit the widely used PESQ measure. Our "PESQetarian" model achieves 3.82 PESQ on VB-DMD while scoring very poorly in a listening experiment. While the obtained PESQ value of 3.82 would imply "state-of-the-art" PESQ-performance on the VB-DMD benchmark, our examples show that when optimizing w.r.t. a metric, an isolated evaluation on the same metric may be misleading. Instead, other metrics should be included in the evaluation and the resulting performance predictions should be confirmed by listening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the applicability of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models based on LSTM units for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task within peer-to-peer learning environments. Leveraging two distinct peer-to-peer learning methods, the study simulates the learning process of agents and evaluates their performance in ASR task using two different ASR datasets. In a centralized training setting, utilizing a scaled-down variant of the Deep Speech 2 model, a single model achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 84\% when trained on the UserLibri dataset, and 38\% when trained on the LJ Speech dataset. Conversely, in a peer-to-peer learning scenario involving 55 agents, the WER ranged from 87\% to 92\% for the UserLibri dataset, and from 52\% to 56\% for the LJ Speech dataset. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of employing Seq2Seq models in decentralized settings, albeit with slightly higher Word Error Rates (WER) compared to centralized training methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the construction of latent spaces through self-supervised learning to support semantically meaningful operations. Analogous to operational amplifiers, these "operational latent spaces" (OpLaS) not only demonstrate semantic structure such as clustering but also support common transformational operations with inherent semantic meaning. Some operational latent spaces are found to have arisen "unintentionally" in the progress toward some (other) self-supervised learning objective, in which unintended but still useful properties are discovered among the relationships of points in the space. Other spaces may be constructed "intentionally" by developers stipulating certain kinds of clustering or transformations intended to produce the desired structure. We focus on the intentional creation of operational latent spaces via self-supervised learning, including the introduction of rotation operators via a novel "FiLMR" layer, which can be used to enable ring-like symmetries found in some musical constructions.</description>

      <title>Textless Acoustic Model with Self-Supervised Distillation for Noise-Robust Expressive Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a textless acoustic model with a self-supervised distillation strategy for noise-robust expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST). Recently proposed expressive S2ST systems have achieved impressive expressivity preservation performances by cascading unit-to-speech (U2S) generator to the speech-to-unit translation model. However, these systems are vulnerable to the presence of noise in input speech, which is an assumption in real-world translation scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a U2S generator that incorporates a distillation with no label (DINO) self-supervised training strategy into it's pretraining process. Because the proposed method captures noise-agnostic expressivity representation, it can generate qualified speech even in noisy environment. Objective and subjective evaluation results verified that the proposed method significantly improved the performance of the expressive S2ST system in noisy environments while maintaining competitive performance in clean environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior works have demonstrated zero-shot text-to-speech by using a generative language model on audio tokens obtained via a neural audio codec. It is still challenging, however, to adapt them to low-latency scenarios. In this paper, we present LiveSpeech - a fully autoregressive language model-based approach for zero-shot text-to-speech, enabling low-latency streaming of the output audio. To allow multiple token prediction within a single decoding step, we propose (1) using adaptive codebook loss weights that consider codebook contribution in each frame and focus on hard instances, and (2) grouping codebooks and processing groups in parallel. Experiments show our proposed models achieve competitive results to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of content accuracy, speaker similarity, audio quality, and inference speed while being suitable for low-latency streaming applications.</description>

      <title>Text Injection for Neural Contextual Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing effectively improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) for crucial phrases within a speaker's context, particularly those that are infrequent in the training data. This work proposes contextual text injection (CTI) to enhance contextual ASR. CTI leverages not only the paired speech-text data, but also a much larger corpus of unpaired text to optimize the ASR model and its biasing component. Unpaired text is converted into speech-like representations and used to guide the model's attention towards relevant bias phrases. Moreover, we introduce a contextual text-injected (CTI) minimum word error rate (MWER) training, which minimizes the expected WER caused by contextual biasing when unpaired text is injected into the model. Experiments show that CTI with 100 billion text sentences can achieve up to 43.3% relative WER reduction from a strong neural biasing model. CTI-MWER provides a further relative improvement of 23.5%.</description>

      <title>Robots Have Been Seen and Not Heard: Effects of Consequential Sounds on Human-Perception of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many people expect robots to move fairly quietly, or make pleasant "beep boop" sounds or jingles similar to what they have observed in videos of robots. Unfortunately, this expectation of quietness does not match reality, as robots make machine sounds, known as 'consequential sounds', as they move and operate. As robots become more prevalent within society, understanding the sounds produced by robots and how these sounds are perceived by people is becoming increasingly important for positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper investigates how people respond to the consequential sounds of robots, specifically how robots make a participant feel, how much they like the robot, would be distracted by the robot, and a person's desire to colocate with robots. Participants were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared with a control condition of completely silent videos. The results in this paper demonstrate with data from 182 participants (858 trials) that consequential sounds produced by robots have a significant negative effect on human perceptions of robots. Firstly there were increased negative 'associated affects' of the participants, such as making them feel more uncomfortable or agitated around the robot. Secondly, the presence of consequential sounds correlated with participants feeling more distracted and less able to focus. Thirdly participants reported being less likely to want to colocate in a shared environment with robots.</description>

      <title>Addressing Index Collapse of Large-Codebook Speech Tokenizer with Dual-Decoding Product-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VQ-VAE, as a mainstream approach of speech tokenizer, has been troubled by ``index collapse'', where only a small number of codewords are activated in large codebooks. This work proposes product-quantized (PQ) VAE with more codebooks but fewer codewords to address this problem and build large-codebook speech tokenizers. It encodes speech features into multiple VQ subspaces and composes them into codewords in a larger codebook. Besides, to utilize each VQ subspace well, we also enhance PQ-VAE via a dual-decoding training strategy with the encoding and quantized sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that PQ-VAE addresses ``index collapse" effectively, especially for larger codebooks. The model with the proposed training strategy further improves codebook perplexity and reconstruction quality, outperforming other multi-codebook VQ approaches. Finally, PQ-VAE demonstrates its effectiveness in language-model-based TTS, supporting higher-quality speech generation with larger codebooks.</description>

      <title>AVFF: Audio-Visual Feature Fusion for Video Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth in deepfake video content, we require improved and generalizable methods to detect them. Most existing detection methods either use uni-modal cues or rely on supervised training to capture the dissonance between the audio and visual modalities. While the former disregards the audio-visual correspondences entirely, the latter predominantly focuses on discerning audio-visual cues within the training corpus, thereby potentially overlooking correspondences that can help detect unseen deepfakes. We present Audio-Visual Feature Fusion (AVFF), a two-stage cross-modal learning method that explicitly captures the correspondence between the audio and visual modalities for improved deepfake detection. The first stage pursues representation learning via self-supervision on real videos to capture the intrinsic audio-visual correspondences. To extract rich cross-modal representations, we use contrastive learning and autoencoding objectives, and introduce a novel audio-visual complementary masking and feature fusion strategy. The learned representations are tuned in the second stage, where deepfake classification is pursued via supervised learning on both real and fake videos. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that our novel representation learning paradigm is highly discriminative in nature. We report 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% AUC on the FakeAVCeleb dataset, outperforming the current audio-visual state-of-the-art by 14.9% and 9.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Distillation Generative Model for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for speech rely on large datasets, presenting computational challenges. Yet, performance hinges on training data size. Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to learn a smaller dataset without much performance degradation when training with it. DD has been investigated in computer vision but not yet in speech. This paper presents the first approach for DD to speech targeting Speech Emotion Recognition on IEMOCAP. We employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) not to mimic real data but to distil key discriminative information of IEMOCAP that is useful for downstream training. The GAN then replaces the original dataset and can sample custom synthetic dataset sizes. It performs comparably when following the original class imbalance but improves performance by 0.3% absolute UAR with balanced classes. It also reduces dataset storage and accelerates downstream training by 95% in both cases and reduces speaker information which could help for a privacy application.</description>

      <title>StreamSpeech: Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation with Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST, a.k.a streaming speech translation) outputs target speech while receiving streaming speech inputs, which is critical for real-time communication. Beyond accomplishing translation between speech, Simul-S2ST requires a policy to control the model to generate corresponding target speech at the opportune moment within speech inputs, thereby posing a double challenge of translation and policy. In this paper, we propose StreamSpeech, a direct Simul-S2ST model that jointly learns translation and simultaneous policy in a unified framework of multi-task learning. Adhering to a multi-task learning approach, StreamSpeech can perform offline and simultaneous speech recognition, speech translation and speech synthesis via an "All-in-One" seamless model. Experiments on CVSS benchmark demonstrate that StreamSpeech achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline S2ST and Simul-S2ST tasks. Besides, StreamSpeech is able to present high-quality intermediate results (i.e., ASR or translation results) during simultaneous translation process, offering a more comprehensive real-time communication experience.</description>

      <title>A Frame-based Attention Interpretation Method for Relevant Acoustic Feature Extraction in Long Speech Depression Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection tools could help early screening of depression. Here, we address two issues that may hinder the clinical practicality of such tools: segment-level labelling noise and a lack of model interpretability. We propose a speech-level Audio Spectrogram Transformer to avoid segment-level labelling. We observe that the proposed model significantly outperforms a segment-level model, providing evidence for the presence of segment-level labelling noise in audio modality and the advantage of longer-duration speech analysis for depression detection. We introduce a frame-based attention interpretation method to extract acoustic features from prediction-relevant waveform signals for interpretation by clinicians. Through interpretation, we observe that the proposed model identifies reduced loudness and F0 as relevant signals of depression, which aligns with the speech characteristics of depressed patients documented in clinical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although current fake audio detection approaches have achieved remarkable success on specific datasets, they often fail when evaluated with datasets from different distributions. Previous studies typically address distribution shift by focusing on using extra data or applying extra loss restrictions during training. However, these methods either require a substantial amount of data or complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a stable learning-based training scheme that involves a Sample Weight Learning (SWL) module, addressing distribution shift by decorrelating all selected features via learning weights from training samples. The proposed portable plug-in-like SWL is easy to apply to multiple base models and generalizes them without using extra data during training. Experiments conducted on the ASVspoof datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of SWL in generalizing different models across three evaluation datasets from different distributions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Source Tracing: Detecting Novel Audio Deepfake Algorithm with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of deepfake audio, there is an urgent need to investigate their attribution. Current source tracing methods can effectively distinguish in-distribution (ID) categories. However, the rapid evolution of deepfake algorithms poses a critical challenge in the accurate identification of out-of-distribution (OOD) novel deepfake algorithms. In this paper, we propose Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion (REFD) strategy for audio deepfake algorithm recognition, demonstrating its effectiveness in discriminating ID samples while identifying OOD samples. For effective OOD detection, we first explore current post-hoc OOD methods and propose NSD, a novel OOD approach in identifying novel deepfake algorithms through the similarity consideration of both feature and logits scores. REFD achieves 86.83% F1-score as a single system in Audio Deepfake Detection Challenge 2023 Track3, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Genuine-Focused Learning using Mask AutoEncoder for Generalized Fake Audio Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization of Fake Audio Detection (FAD) is critical due to the emergence of new spoofing techniques. Traditional FAD methods often focus solely on distinguishing between genuine and known spoofed audio. We propose a Genuine-Focused Learning (GFL) framework guided, aiming for highly generalized FAD, called GFL-FAD. This method incorporates a Counterfactual Reasoning Enhanced Representation (CRER) based on audio reconstruction using the Mask AutoEncoder (MAE) architecture to accurately model genuine audio features. To reduce the influence of spoofed audio during training, we introduce a genuine audio reconstruction loss, maintaining the focus on learning genuine data features. In addition, content-related bottleneck (BN) features are extracted from the MAE to supplement the knowledge of the original audio. These BN features are adaptively fused with CRER to further improve robustness. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EER of 0.25% on ASVspoof2019 LA.</description>

      <title>ASoBO: Attentive Beamformer Selection for Distant Speaker Diarization in Meetings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker Diarization (SD) aims at grouping speech segments that belong to the same speaker. This task is required in many speech-processing applications, such as rich meeting transcription. In this context, distant microphone arrays usually capture the audio signal. Beamforming, i.e., spatial filtering, is a common practice to process multi-microphone audio data. However, it often requires an explicit localization of the active source to steer the filter. This paper proposes a self-attention-based algorithm to select the output of a bank of fixed spatial filters. This method serves as a feature extractor for joint Voice Activity (VAD) and Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD). The speaker diarization is then inferred from the detected segments. The approach shows convincing distant VAD, OSD, and SD performance, e.g. 14.5% DER on the AISHELL-4 dataset. The analysis of the self-attention weights demonstrates their explainability, as they correlate with the speaker's angular locations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have rapidly become the preferred choice for audio classification, surpassing methods based on CNNs. However, Audio Spectrogram Transformers (ASTs) exhibit quadratic scaling due to self-attention. The removal of this quadratic self-attention cost presents an appealing direction. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have demonstrated potential in language and vision tasks in this regard. In this study, we explore whether reliance on self-attention is necessary for audio classification tasks. By introducing Audio Mamba (AuM), the first self-attention-free, purely SSM-based model for audio classification, we aim to address this question. We evaluate AuM on various audio datasets - comprising six different benchmarks - where it achieves comparable or better performance compared to well-established AST model.</description>

      <title>Physics and geometry informed neural operator network with application to acoustic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a physics and geometry informed neural operator network with application to the forward simulation of acoustic scattering. The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.</description>

      <title>HAAQI-Net: A Non-intrusive Neural Music Audio Quality Assessment Model for Hearing Aids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces HAAQI-Net, a non-intrusive deep learning model for music audio quality assessment tailored for hearing aid users. Unlike traditional methods like the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI), which rely on intrusive comparisons to a reference signal, HAAQI-Net offers a more accessible and efficient alternative. Using a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) architecture with attention mechanisms and features from the pre-trained BEATs model, HAAQI-Net predicts HAAQI scores directly from music audio clips and hearing loss patterns. Results show HAAQI-Net's effectiveness, with predicted scores achieving a Linear Correlation Coefficient (LCC) of 0.9368, a Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9486, and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0064, reducing inference time from 62.52 seconds to 2.54 seconds. Although effective, feature extraction via the large BEATs model incurs computational overhead. To address this, a knowledge distillation strategy creates a student distillBEATs model, distilling information from the teacher BEATs model during HAAQI-Net training, reducing required parameters. The distilled HAAQI-Net maintains strong performance with an LCC of 0.9071, an SRCC of 0.9307, and an MSE of 0.0091, while reducing parameters by 75.85% and inference time by 96.46%. This reduction enhances HAAQI-Net's efficiency and scalability, making it viable for real-world music audio quality assessment in hearing aid settings. This work also opens avenues for further research into optimizing deep learning models for specific applications, contributing to audio signal processing and quality assessment by providing insights into developing efficient and accurate models for practical applications in hearing aid technology.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sample Dynamic Time Warping for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-sample keyword spotting, each keyword class is represented by multiple spoken instances, called samples. A na\"ive approach to detect keywords in a target sequence consists of querying all samples of all classes using sub-sequence dynamic time warping. However, the resulting processing time increases linearly with respect to the number of samples belonging to each class. Alternatively, only a single Fr\'echet mean can be queried for each class, resulting in reduced processing time but usually also in worse detection performance as the variability of the query samples is not captured sufficiently well. In this work, multi-sample dynamic time warping is proposed to compute class-specific cost-tensors that include the variability of all query samples. To significantly reduce the computational complexity during inference, these cost tensors are converted to cost matrices before applying dynamic time warping. In experimental evaluations for few-shot keyword spotting, it is shown that this method yields a very similar performance as using all individual query samples as templates while having a runtime that is only slightly slower than when using Fr\'echet means.</description>

      <title>Improving the Adversarial Robustness for Speaker Verification by Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous works have shown that automatic speaker verification (ASV) is seriously vulnerable to malicious spoofing attacks, such as replay, synthetic speech, and recently emerged adversarial attacks. Great efforts have been dedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a few approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the existing approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge for adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know the exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This work is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing the specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models (SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the inputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work regards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial defense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial defense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2) adversarial perturbation detection. Experimental results show that our detection module effectively shields the ASV by detecting adversarial samples with an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, since there is no common metric for evaluating the adversarial defense performance for ASV, this work also formalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both purification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely encourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed evaluation framework.</description>

      <title>Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive neural vocoders have achieved outstanding performance in speech synthesis tasks such as text-to-speech and voice conversion. An autoregressive vocoder predicts a sample at some time step conditioned on those at previous time steps. Though it synthesizes natural human speech, the iterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the utterance length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to generating the whole speech sequence in parallel and proposed GAN-based, flow-based, and score-based vocoders. This paper proposed a new thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is split into frequency subbands, and a subband is generated conditioned on the previously generated one. Similarly, in BAR, an 8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By redesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time domain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer proportional to the utterance length but to the number of subbands/bits, significantly increasing inference efficiency. Besides, a post-filter is employed to sample signals from output posteriors; its training objective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model can synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration. Compared with baseline vocoders, the proposed model achieves better MUSHRA results and shows good generalization ability for unseen speakers and 44 kHz speech.</description>

Abstract: Pronunciation assessment models designed for open response scenarios enable users to practice language skills in a manner similar to real-life communication. However, previous open-response pronunciation assessment models have predominantly focused on a single pronunciation task, such as sentence-level accuracy, rather than offering a comprehensive assessment in various aspects. We propose MultiPA, a Multitask Pronunciation Assessment model that provides sentence-level accuracy, fluency, prosody, and word-level accuracy assessment for open responses. We examined the correlation between different pronunciation tasks and showed the benefits of multi-task learning. Our model reached the state-of-the-art performance on existing in-domain data sets and effectively generalized to an out-of-domain dataset that we newly collected. The experimental results demonstrate the practical utility of our model in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Dance Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dance serves as a powerful medium for expressing human emotions, but the lifelike generation of dance is still a considerable challenge. Recently, diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless, current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally, lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements, people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior, we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation, where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother, a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions, which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and consolidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat, the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches on the prominent benchmark for music-to-dance generation.</description>

      <title>Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13086</link>

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio. We train the decoder with a loss function that maximizes the confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion. Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>SimpleSpeech: Towards Simple and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Scalar Latent Transformer Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a simple and efficient Non-Autoregressive (NAR) text-to-speech (TTS) system based on diffusion, named SimpleSpeech. Its simpleness shows in three aspects: (1) It can be trained on the speech-only dataset, without any alignment information; (2) It directly takes plain text as input and generates speech through an NAR way; (3) It tries to model speech in a finite and compact latent space, which alleviates the modeling difficulty of diffusion. More specifically, we propose a novel speech codec model (SQ-Codec) with scalar quantization, SQ-Codec effectively maps the complex speech signal into a finite and compact latent space, named scalar latent space. Benefits from SQ-Codec, we apply a novel transformer diffusion model in the scalar latent space of SQ-Codec. We train SimpleSpeech on 4k hours of a speech-only dataset, it shows natural prosody and voice cloning ability. Compared with previous large-scale TTS models, it presents significant speech quality and generation speed improvement. Demos are released.</description>
