      <title>Protein binding affinity prediction under multiple substitutions applying eGNNs on Residue and Atomic graphs combined with Language model information: eGRAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in numerous biological processes. Developing methods that predict binding affinity changes under substitution mutations is fundamental for modelling and re-engineering biological systems. Deep learning is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool capable of bridging the gap between in-silico predictions and in-vitro observations. With this contribution, we propose eGRAL, a novel SE(3) equivariant graph neural network (eGNN) architecture designed for predicting binding affinity changes from multiple amino acid substitutions in protein complexes. eGRAL leverages residue, atomic and evolutionary scales, thanks to features extracted from protein large language models. To address the limited availability of large-scale affinity assays with structural information, we generate a simulated dataset comprising approximately 500,000 data points. Our model is pre-trained on this dataset, then fine-tuned and tested on experimental data.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous network and graph attention auto-encoder for LncRNA-disease association prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging research shows that lncRNAs are associated with a series of complex human diseases. However, most of the existing methods have limitations in identifying nonlinear lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs), and it remains a huge challenge to predict new LDAs. Therefore, the accurate identification of LDAs is very important for the warning and treatment of diseases. In this work, multiple sources of biomedical data are fully utilized to construct characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases, and linear and nonlinear characteristics are effectively integrated. Furthermore, a novel deep learning model based on graph attention automatic encoder is proposed, called HGATELDA. To begin with, the linear characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases are created by the miRNA-lncRNA interaction matrix and miRNA-disease interaction matrix. Following this, the nonlinear features of diseases and lncRNAs are extracted using a graph attention auto-encoder, which largely retains the critical information and effectively aggregates the neighborhood information of nodes. In the end, LDAs can be predicted by fusing the linear and nonlinear characteristics of diseases and lncRNA. The HGATELDA model achieves an impressive AUC value of 0.9692 when evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation indicating its superior performance in comparison to several recent prediction models. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of HGATELDA in identifying novel LDAs is further demonstrated by case studies. the HGATELDA model appears to be a viable computational model for predicting LDAs.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Stochastic Importation Dynamics and Establishment of Novel Pathogenic Strains using a General Branching Processes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importation and subsequent establishment of novel pathogenic strains in a population is subject to a large degree of uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Mathematical models need to take this stochasticity in the early phase of an outbreak in order to adequately capture the uncertainty in disease forecasts. We propose a general branching process model of disease spread that includes host-level heterogeneity, and that can be straightforwardly tailored to capture the salient aspects of a particular disease outbreak. We combine this with a model of case importation that occurs via an independent marked Poisson process. We use this framework to investigate the impact of different control strategies, particularly on the time to establishment of an invading, exogenous strain, using parameters taken from the literature for COVID-19 as an example. We also demonstrate how to combine our model with a deterministic approximation, such that longer term projections can be generated that still incorporate the uncertainty from the early growth phase of the epidemic. Our approach produces meaningful short- and medium-term projections of the course of a disease outbreak when model parameters are still uncertain and when stochasticity still has a large effect on the population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy enhances organisms' performance in rock-paper-scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a five-species cyclic system wherein individuals of one species strategically adapt their movements to enhance their performance in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. Environmental cues enable the awareness of the presence of organisms targeted for elimination in the cyclic game. If the local density of target organisms is sufficiently high, individuals move towards concentrated areas for direct attack; otherwise, they employ an ambush tactic, maximising the chances of success by targeting regions likely to be dominated by opponents. Running stochastic simulations, we discover that the ambush strategy enhances the likelihood of individual success compared to direct attacks alone, leading to uneven spatial patterns characterised by spiral waves. We compute the autocorrelation function and measure how the ambush tactic unbalances the organisms' spatial organisation by calculating the characteristic length scale of typical spatial domains of each species. We demonstrate that the threshold for local species density influences the ambush strategy's effectiveness, while the neighbourhood perception range significantly impacts decision-making accuracy. The outcomes show that long-range perception improves performance by over 60\%, although there is potential interference in decision-making under high attack triggers. Understanding how organisms' adaptation to their environment enhances their performance may be helpful not only for ecologists but also for data scientists aiming to improve artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>AntiFold: Improved antibody structure-based design using inverse folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of antibodies requires an intricate balance across multiple properties. Protein inverse folding models, capable of generating diverse sequences folding into the same structure, are promising tools for maintaining structural integrity during antibody design. Here, we present AntiFold, an antibody-specific inverse folding model, fine-tuned from ESM-IF1 on solved and predicted antibody structures. AntiFold outperforms existing inverse folding tools on sequence recovery across complementarity-determining regions, with designed sequences showing high structural similarity to their solved counterpart. It additionally achieves stronger correlations when predicting antibody-antigen binding affinity in a zero-shot manner, while performance is augmented further when including antigen information. AntiFold assigns low probabilities to mutations that disrupt antigen binding, synergizing with protein language model residue probabilities, and demonstrates promise for guiding antibody optimization while retaining structure-related properties.

      <title>Fibration symmetries and cluster synchronization in the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing how the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome structure gives rise to its neuron functionality remains unclear. It is through fiber symmetries found in its neuronal connectivity that synchronization of a group of neurons can be determined. To understand these we investigate graph symmetries and search for such in the symmetrized versions of the forward and backward locomotive sub-networks of the Caenorhabditi elegans worm neuron network. The use of ordinarily differential equations simulations admissible to these graphs are used to validate the predictions of these fiber symmetries and are compared to the more restrictive orbit symmetries. Additionally fibration symmetries are used to decompose these graphs into their fundamental building blocks which reveal units formed by nested loops or multilayered fibers. It is found that fiber symmetries of the connectome can accurately predict neuronal synchronization even under not idealized connectivity as long as the dynamics are within stable regimes of simulations.</description>

      <title>BOLD v4: A Centralized Bioinformatics Platform for DNA-based Biodiversity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BOLD, the Barcode of Life Data System, supports the acquisition, storage, validation, analysis, and publication of DNA barcodes, activities requiring the integration of molecular, morphological, and distributional data. Its pivotal role in curating the reference library of DNA barcodes, coupled with its data management and analysis capabilities, make it a central resource for biodiversity science. It enables rapid, accurate identification of specimens and also reveals patterns of genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among taxa. Launched in 2005, BOLD has become an increasingly powerful tool for advancing understanding of planetary biodiversity. It currently hosts 17 million specimen records and 14 million barcodes that provide coverage for more than a million species from every continent and ocean. The platform has the long-term goal of providing a consistent, accurate system for identifying all species of eukaryotes. BOLD's integrated analytical tools, full data lifecycle support, and secure collaboration framework distinguish it from other biodiversity platforms. BOLD v4 brought enhanced data management and analysis capabilities as well as novel functionality for data dissemination and publication. Its next version will include features to strengthen its utility to the research community, governments, industry, and society-at-large.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>
