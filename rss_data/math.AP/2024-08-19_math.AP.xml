      <title>A holographic uniqueness theorem for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a plane wave, a radiation solution, and the sum of these solutions (total solution) for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^2$. We consider a straight line in this region, such that the direction of propagation of the plane wave is not parallel to this line. We show that the radiation solution in the exterior region is uniquely determined by the intensity of the total solution on an interval of this line. In particular, this result solves one of the old mathematical questions of holography in its two-dimensional setting. Our proofs also contribute to the theory of the Karp expansion of radiation solutions in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Initial Boundary Value Problem For A Non-conservative System In Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the initial boundary value problem for a nonconservative system of hyperbolic equation appearing in elastodynamics in the space time domain $x &gt; 0, t &gt; 0$. The number of boundary conditions to be prescribed at the boundary $x = 0$, depend on the number of characteristics entering the domain. Since our system is nonlinear the characteristic speeds depends on the unknown and the direction of the characteristics curves are known apriori. As it is well known, the boundary condition has to be understood in a generalised way. One of the standard way is using vanishing viscosity method. We use this method to construct solution for a particular class of initial and boundary data, namely the initial and boundary datas that lie on the level sets of one of the Riemann invariants.</description>

      <title>Minimal mass blow-up solutions for a inhomogeneous NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger (INLS) equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ \begin{align}\label{inls} i \partial_t u +\Delta u +V(x)|u|^{\frac{4-2b}{N}}u = 0, \end{align} where $V(x) = k(x)|x|^{-b}$, with $b&gt;0$. Under suitable assumptions on $k(x)$, we established the threshold for global existence and blow-up and then study the existence and non-existence of minimal mass blow-up solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for multiple species in a porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations form a coupled parabolic-elliptic system, which models the transport of charged particles under the influence of diffusion and electric force. In this paper, we rigorously derive a homogenized model for the PNP equations, for the case of multiple species, defined on a periodic porous medium in spatial dimensions two and three. This extends the previous homogenization results for the PNP equations concerning two species. Here, the main difficulty is that the microscopic concentrations remain uniformly bounded in a space with relatively weak regularity. Therefore, the standard Aubin-Lions-Simon-type compactness results for porous media, which give strong convergence of the microscopic solutions, become inapplicable in our weak setting. We overcome this problem by constructing suitable cut-off functions. The cut-off function, together with the previously known energy functional associated with the system, gives us equicontinuity of the microscopic concentrations on the part of the domain where the values of the concentrations do not exceed the height of the cut-off function. Moreover, it turns out that, on the remaining part of the domain where the concentrations are larger than the height of the cut-off function, the application of the energy functional is enough in order to obtain equicontinuity. These arguments eventually yield strong convergence of the microscopic concentrations in $L^1_t L^r_x$, for some $r&gt;2$, enabling us to pass to the limit in the nonlinear drift term. Finally, we derive the homogenized equations by means of two-scale convergence in $L^p_t L^q_x$ setting.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Wasserstein dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a drift-diffusion process on the probability simplex to study stochastic fluctuations in probability spaces. We construct a counting process for linear detailed balanced chemical reactions with finite species such that its thermodynamic limit is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) on the probability simplex. This ODE can be formulated as a gradient flow with an Onsager response matrix that induces a Riemannian metric on the probability simplex. After incorporating the induced Riemannian structure, we propose a diffusion approximation of the rescaled counting process for molecular species in the chemical reactions, which leads to Langevin dynamics on the probability simplex with a degenerate Brownian motion constructed from the eigen-decomposition of Onsager's response matrix. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation on the simplex can be regarded as the usual drift-diffusion equation with the extrinsic representation of the divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator. The invariant measure is the Gibbs measure, which is the product of the original macroscopic free energy and a volume element. When the drift term vanishes, the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the heat equation with the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which we refer to as canonical Wasserstein diffusions on graphs. In the case of a two-point probability simplex, the constructed diffusion process is converted to one dimensional Wright-Fisher diffusion process, which leads to a natural boundary condition ensuring that the process remains within the probability simplex.</description>

      <title>Delay rough evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we accomplish the existence and stability of the solution of a class of delay rough partial differential equations (DRPDEs). Moreover, we prove that the solution of DRPDEs can converge to that of RPDEs in sense of some distance as the delay tends to zero. As applications, we employ the main results to the study of a class of delay stochastic partial differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$.</description>

      <title>Stability of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili multi-line solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the long-standing inverse scattering theory (IST) of perturbed Kadomtsev Petviashvili multi-line solitons. Our work is the first rigorous IST of a multi-dimensional integrable system when both continuous and discrete scattering data are present, and the support of continuous scattering data does not degenerate into contours in the complex plane. As an application, an $L^\infty$-stability theorem of the Kadomtsev Petviashvili multi-line solitons is justified.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between validity of the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality and finiteness of the strict $p$-capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Singular Solutions to the Complex Monge-Amp\`ere Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit pluripotential and viscosity solution to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation with constant right-hand side on $\mathbb D\times\mathbb C^{n-1}\,(n\geq 2)$, which lies merely in $W^{1,2}_{loc}\cap W^{2,1}_{loc}$ and is not even Dini continuous. Additionally, we exhibit two families of explicit entire toric solutions on $\mathbb C^n$ with continuous H\"older exponent $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $W^{2,p}_{loc}$ exponent $p\in (1,2)$.</description>
