      <title>The Labeled Coupon Collector Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the well-known Coupon Collector Problem (CCP) in combinatorics. Our problem is to find the minimum and expected number of draws, with replacement, required to recover $n$ distinctly labeled coupons, with each draw consisting of a random subset of $k$ different coupons and a random ordering of their associated labels. We specify two variations of the problem, Type-I in which the set of labels is known at the start, and Type-II in which the set of labels is unknown at the start. We show that our problem can be viewed as an extension of the separating system problem introduced by R\'enyi and Katona, provide a full characterization of the minimum, and provide a numerical approach to finding the expectation using a Markov chain model, with special attention given to the case where two coupons are drawn at a time.</description>

      <title>Sharp Square Root Bounds for Edge Eigenvector Universality in Sparse Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eigenvectors of random regular graphs behave when projected onto fixed directions. For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the degree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow approximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen bound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\sqrt{d} \cdot N^{-1/6+\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly improves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we prove our $\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities that exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a vector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and (3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control higher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for eigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers, Clique Covers, and Induced Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Cops and Robbers game played on finite simple graphs. In a graph $G$, the number of cops required to capture a robber in the Cops and Robbers game is denoted by $c(G)$. For all graphs $G$, $c(G) \leq \alpha(G) \leq \theta(G)$ where $\alpha(G)$ and $\theta(G)$ are the independence number and clique cover number respectively. In 2022 Turcotte asked if $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$ for all graphs with $\alpha(G) \geq 3$. Recently, Char, Maniya, and Pradhan proved this is false, at least when $\alpha = 3$,by demonstrating the compliment of the Shrikhande graph has cop number and independence number $3$. We prove, using random graphs, the stronger result that for all $k\geq 1$ there exists a graph $G$ such that $c(G) = \alpha(G) = \theta(G) = k$. Next, we consider the structure of graphs with $c(G) = \theta(G) \geq 3$. We prove, using structural arguments, that any graphs $G$ which satisfies $c(G) = \theta(G) = k \geq 3$ contain induced cycles of all lengths $3\leq t \leq k+1$. This implies all perfect graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)\geq 4$ have $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$. Additionally,we discuss if typical triangle-free and $C_4$-free graphs will have $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of Expander Walks via Fourier Analysis on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to study the pseudorandomness properties of walks on expander graphs is to label the vertices of an expander with elements from an alphabet $\Sigma$, and study the mean of functions over $\Sigma^n$. We say expander walks $\varepsilon$-fool a function if, for any unbiased labeling of the vertices, the expander walk mean is $\varepsilon$-close to the true mean. We show that:
  - The class of symmetric functions is $O(|\Sigma|\cdot\lambda)$-fooled by expander walks over any generic $\lambda$-expander, and any alphabet $\Sigma$ . This generalizes the result of Cohen, Peri, Ta-Shma [STOC'21] which analyzes it for $|\Sigma| =2$, and exponentially improves the previous bound of $O(|\Sigma|^{O(|\Sigma|)}\cdot \lambda)$, by Golowich and Vadhan [CCC'22]. Additionally, if the expander is a Cayley graph over $\mathbb{Z}_{|\Sigma|}$, we get a further improved bound of $O(\sqrt{|\Sigma|}\cdot\lambda)$.
  Morever, when $\Sigma$ is a finite group $G$, we show the following for functions over $G^n$:
  - The class of symmetric class functions is $O\Big({\frac{\sqrt{|G|}}{D}\cdot\lambda}\Big)$-fooled by expander walks over "structured" $\lambda$-expanders, if $G$ is $D$-quasirandom.
  - We show a lower bound of $\Omega(\lambda)$ for symmetric functions for any finite group $G$ (even for "structured" $\lambda$-expanders).
  - We study the Fourier spectrum of a class of non-symmetric functions arising from word maps, and show that they are exponentially fooled by expander walks.
  Our proof employs Fourier analysis over general groups, which contrasts with earlier works that have studied either the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. This enables us to get quantitatively better bounds even for unstructured sets.</description>

      <title>Graphs With the Same Edge Count in Each Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Caro, Lauri, Mifsud, Yuster, and Zarb ask which parameters $r$ and $c$ admit the existence of an $r$-regular graph such that the neighborhood of each vertex induces exactly $c$ edges. They show that every $r$ with $c$ satisfying $0\leq c\leq {r\choose 2}-5r^{3/2}$ is achievable, but no $r$ with $c$ satisfying ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor\leq c\leq {r\choose 2}-1$ is. We strengthen the bound in their nonexistence result from ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor$ to ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$. Additionally, when the graph is the Cayley graph of an abelian group, we obtain a much more fine-grained characterization of the achievable values of $c$ between $\binom{r}{2} - 5r^{3/2}$ and $\binom{r}{2} - \lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$, which we conjecture to be the correct answer for general graphs as well. That result relies on a lemma about approximate subgroups in the "99% regime," quantifying the extent to which nearly-additively-closed subsets of an abelian group must be close to actual subgroups. Finally, we consider a generalization to graphs with multiple types of edges and partially resolve several open questions of Caro et al. about $\textit{flip}$ colorings of graphs.</description>

      <title>Dvorak-Dell-Grohe-Rattan theorem via an asymptotic argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two graphs $G_1,G_2$ are distinguished by the Weisfeiler--Leman isomorphism test if and only if there is a tree $T$ that has a different number of homomorphisms to $G_1$ and to $G_2$. There are two known proofs of this fact -- a logical proof by Dvorak and a linear-algebraic proof by Dell, Grohe, and Rattan. We give another simple proof, based on ordering WL-labels and asymptotic arguments.</description>

      <title>A Myhill-Nerode Type Characterization of 2detLIN Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear automata are automata with two reading heads starting from the two extremes of the input, are equivalent to 5' -&gt; 3' Watson-Crick (WK) finite automata. The heads read the input in opposite directions and the computation finishes when the heads meet. These automata accept the class LIN of linear languages. The deterministic counterpart of these models, on the one hand, is less expressive, as only a proper subset of LIN, the class 2detLIN is accepted; and on the other hand, they are also equivalent in the sense of the class of the accepted languages. Now, based on these automata models, we characterize the class of 2detLIN languages with a Myhill-Nerode type of equivalence classes. However, as these automata may do the computation of both the prefix and the suffix of the input, we use prefix-suffix pairs in our classes. Additionally, it is proven that finitely many classes in the characterization match with the 2detLIN languages, but we have some constraints on the used prefix-suffix pairs, i.e., the characterization should have the property to be complete and it must not have any crossing pairs.</description>

      <title>Paired many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover of Johnson graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two 2 disjoint vertex-sets $S=\{u,x\}$ and $T=\{v,y\}$, a paired many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover joining S and T, is a set of two vertex-disjoint paths with endpoints $u,v$ and $x,y$, respectively, that cover every vertex of the graph. If the graph has a many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover for any two disjoint vertex-sets $S$ and $T$, then it is called paired 2-coverable. It is known that if a graph is paired 2-coverable, then it must be Hamilton-connected, but the reverse is not true. It has been proved that Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$, $0\le k\le n$, are Hamilton-connected by Brian Alspach in [Ars Math. Contemp. 6 (2013) 21--23]. In this paper, we prove that Johnson graphs are paired 2-coverable. Moreover, we obtain that another family of graphs $QJ(n,k)$ constructed from Johnson graphs by Alspach are also paired 2-coverable.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Color-constrained Paths in Semicomplete Multipartite Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every semicomplete multipartite digraph contains a quasi-Hamiltonian path, but the problem of finding a quasi-Hamiltonian path with prescribed start and end vertex is NP-complete even when restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number exactly 3. Bang-Jensen, Wang and Yeo (arXiv 2024) showed that deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which does not contain at least one vertex from each color class is NP-complete. Similarly, deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which intersects every part exactly once is also NP-complete as shown in the same work.
  In this paper, we continue the study of paths with constraints on the number of covered vertices from each color class. We consider the problem of finding a path with prescribed start and end vertex that contains at least $a$ and at most $b$ vertices from each color class where all color classes have size exactly $\alpha$. This unifies the Hamiltonian path problem, the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem and the path-version of the cycle problems mentioned above, among other problems. Using Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, we classify the complexity of almost all problems in our framework. Notable open problems are the Hamiltonian path problem on semicomplete multipartite digraphs as well as the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number 2.
  We then investigate the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number 2. We generalize sufficient criteria for Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in semicomplete digraphs to sufficient criteria for quasi-Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in this class. Although this does not settle the problem, the initial results suggest that this special case may be solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13153v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem.
  Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths and forbidden patterns: Polylogarithmic bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a long path $P$. When is it the case that $G$ also contains a long induced path? This question has been investigated in general as well as within a number of different graph classes since the 80s. We have recently observed in a companion paper (Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns, arXiv:2411.08685, 2024) that most existing results can recovered in a simple way by considering forbidden ordered patterns of edges along the path $P$. In particular we proved that if we forbid some fixed ordered matching along a path of order $n$ in a graph $G$, then $G$ must contain an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. Moreover, we completely characterized the forbidden ordered patterns forcing the existence of an induced path of polynomial size.
  The purpose of the present paper is to completely characterize the ordered patterns $H$ such that forbidding $H$ along a path $P$ of order $n$ implies the existence of an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. These patterns are star forests with some specific ordering, which we called constellations.
  As a direct consequence of our result, we show that if a graph $G$ has a path of length $n$ and does not contain $K_t$ as a topological minor, then $G$ contains an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1/t \log^2 t)}$. The previously best known bound was $(\log n)^{f(t)}$ for some unspecified function $f$ depending on the Topological Minor Structure Theorem of Grohe and Marx (2015).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative, simple method to prove isoperimetric inequalities over the hypercube. In particular, we show:
  1. An elementary proof of classical isoperimetric inequalities of Talagrand, as well as a stronger isoperimetric result conjectured by Talagrand and recently proved by Eldan and Gross.
  2. A strengthening of the Friedgut junta theorem, asserting that if the $p$-moment of the sensitivity of a function is constant for some $1/2 + \varepsilon\leq p\leq 1$, then the function is close to a junta. In this language, Friedgut's theorem is the special case that $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a data fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>

Abstract: We present an explicit closed-form formula for the vertices of the classical cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors of the complete graph $K_n$. Our derivation proceeds via a related polytope, denoted $\mathbf{1}$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, whose vertices are obtained by flipping all bits of the $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$ vertices. This polytope arises naturally in a probabilistic context involving agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables which serves as the starting point of this work.
  Our approach constructs the vertex set recursively via a binary encoding that stems from this probabilistic perspective. We prove that the resulting sequence of encoded integers, when appropriately scaled, exhibits an almost-linear behavior closely approximating the line $y = x - \frac{1}{2}$. This structure motivates the introduction of the alternating cycle function, an integer-valued map whose key property is power-of-two composition invariance. The function serves as the foundation for our closed-form enumeration formula.
  The result provides a rare instance of explicit vertex characterization for a $0$/$1$-polytope and offers a transparent combinatorial construction independent of enumeration algorithms.</description>
