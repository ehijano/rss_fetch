      <title>The Steenrod squares via unordered joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steenrod squares are cohomology operations with important applications in algebraic topology. While these operations are well-understood classically, little is known about them in the setting of homotopy type theory. Although a definition of the Steenrod squares was put forward by Brunerie (2017), proofs of their characterising properties have remained elusive. In this paper, we revisit Brunerie's definition and provide proofs of these properties, including stability, Cartan's formula and the Adem relations. This is done by studying a higher inductive type called the unordered join. This approach is inherently synthetic and, consequently, many of our proofs differ significantly from their classical counterparts. Along the way, we discuss upshots and limitations of homotopy type theory as a synthetic language for homotopy theory. The paper is accompanied by a computer formalisation in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Multiparameter Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dey and Xin (J.Appl.Comput.Top., 2022, arXiv:1904.03766) describe an algorithm to decompose finitely presented multiparameter persistence modules using a matrix reduction algorithm. Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Morgan's mixed Hodge structures on $p$-filiform Lie algebras and low-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Real Bott manifold structure of $n$-dimensional Klein bottle and its rational Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Donald Davis initiated the study of an $n$-dimensional analogue of the Klein bottle. This generalized Klein bottle occurs as a moduli space of planar polygons for a certain choice of side lengths. In this paper, we show that the $n$-dimensional Klein bottle is a real Bott manifold and determine the corresponding Bott matrix. We determine the small cover structure on two other classes of moduli spaces of planar polygons. As an application, we compute the rational Betti numbers of these spaces using a formula, due to Suciu and Trevisan.</description>

      <title>Persistent Stiefel-Whitney Classes of Tangent Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stiefel-Whitney classes are invariants of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, represented as cohomology classes of the base manifold. These classes are essential in obstruction theory, embedding problems, and cobordism theory. In this work, we first reestablish an appropriate notion of vector bundles in a persistent setting, allowing characteristic classes to be interpreted through topological data analysis. Next, we propose a concrete algorithm to compute persistent cohomology classes that represent the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. Given a point cloud, we construct a \v{C}ech or alpha filtration. By applying the Wu formula in this setting, we derive a sequence of persistent cohomology classes from the filtration. We show that if the filtration is homotopy equivalent to a smooth manifold, then one of these persistent cohomology classes corresponds to the $k$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of that manifold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on real-world datasets, including applications to complex manifolds, image patches, and molecular conformation space.</description>

      <title>Hermitian K-theory for stable $\infty$-categories II: Cobordism categories and additivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07224v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Grothendieck-Witt spectra in the setting of Poincar\'e $\infty$-categories and show that they fit into an extension with a K- and an L-theoretic part. As consequences we deduce localisation sequences for Verdier quotients, and generalisations of Karoubi's fundamental and periodicity theorems for rings in which 2 need not be invertible. Our set-up allows for the uniform treatment of such algebraic examples alongside homotopy-theoretic generalisations: For example, the periodicity theorem holds for complex oriented $\mathrm{E}_1$-rings, and we show that the Grothendieck-Witt theory of parametrised spectra recovers Weiss and Williams' LA-theory.
  Our Grothendieck-Witt spectra are defined via a version of the hermitian Q-construction, and a novel feature of our approach is to interpret the latter as a cobordism category. This perspective also allows us to give a hermitian version -- along with a concise proof -- of the theorem of Blumberg, Gepner and Tabuada, and provides a cobordism theoretic description of the aforementioned LA-spectra.</description>

      <title>Syntomic cohomology of Morava K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the MU-based syntomic cohomologies, mod $(p,v_1,\cdots,v_{n+1})$, of all $\mathbb{E}_1$-MU-algebra forms of connective Morava K-theory k(n). As qualitative consequences, we deduce the Lichtenbaum--Quillen conjecture, telescope conjecture, and redshift conjecture for the algebraic K-theories of all $\mathbb{E}_{1}$-$\mathbb{S}$-algebra forms of $(2p^n-2)$-periodic Morava K-theory. Notably, the motivic spectral sequence computing $\pi_*TC(k(n))_p$ is concentrated on at most three lines, independently of $n$.</description>
