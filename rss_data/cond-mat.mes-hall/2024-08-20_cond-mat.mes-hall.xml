      <title>Mapping the topological proximity-induced gap of multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs), devices in which a normal metal is in contact with three or more superconducting leads, have been proposed as artificial analogs of topological crystals. The topological nature of MTJJs manifests as a modulation of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) in the normal metal that may be probed by tunneling measurements. We show that one can reveal this modulation by measuring the resistance of diffusive MTJJs with normal contacts, which shows rich structure as a function of the phase differences $\{\phi_i \}$. Our approach demonstrates a simple yet powerful technique for exploring topological effects in MTJJs.</description>

      <title>Perspective on Atomic-Resolution Vibrational Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instrumentation developments in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) one decade ago paved the way for combining milli-electronvolt energy resolution in spectroscopy with \r{A}ngstr\"om-sized electron probes, unlocking new realms for solid state physics at the nanometer-scale. The fundamental understanding of the scattering processes involved has made it possible to separate atomically localized signals, providing new insights into vibrations at the atomic scale. In this Letter, we outline the experimental, conceptual and theoretical advances in this field and also make comparisons with tip-based optical techniques before discussing future perspectives of this exciting technique. Optimization of dark-field signal collection will play a fundamental role in making this technique more widely applicable to a range of materials problems. The benefits of adding momentum-resolution will also be discussed and a novel acquisition scheme proposed.</description>

      <title>Surface spectroscopy and surface-bulk hybridization of Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal showing open-arc surface states is a prominent example of topological quantum matter in three dimensions. With the bulk-boundary correspondence present, nontrivial surface-bulk hybridization is inevitable but less understood. Spectroscopies have been often limited to verifying the existence of surface Fermi arcs, whereas its spectral shape related to the hybridization profile in energy-momentum space is not well studied. We present an exactly solvable formalism at the surface for a wide range of prototypical Weyl semimetals. The resonant surface state and the bulk influence coexist as a surface-bulk hybrid and are treated in a unified manner. Directly accessible to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analytically reveal universal information about the system obtained from the spectroscopy of resonant topological states. We systematically find inhomogeneous and anisotropic singular responses around the surface-bulk merging borderline crossing Weyl points, highlighting its critical role in the Weyl topology. The response in scanning tunneling spectroscopy is also discussed. The results will provide much-needed insight into the surface-bulk-coupled physical properties and guide in-depth spectroscopic investigation of the nontrivial hybrid in many topological semimetal materials.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Steady State Full Counting Statistics in the Noncrossing Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transport is often characterized not just by mean observables like the particle or energy current, but by their fluctuations and higher moments, which can act as detailed probes of the physical mechanisms at play. However, relatively few theoretical methods are able to access the full counting statistics (FCS) of transport processes through electronic junctions in strongly correlated regimes. While most experiments are concerned with the steady state properties, most accurate theoretical methods rely on computationally expensive propagation from a tractable initial state. Here, we propose a simple approach for computing the FCS through a junction directly at the steady state, utilizing the propagator noncrossing approximation (NCA). Compared to time propagation, our method offers reduced computational cost at the same level of approximation; but the idea can also be used within other approximations or as a basis for numerically exact techniques. We demonstrate the method's capabilities by investigating the impact of lead dimensionality on electronic transport in the nonequilibrium Anderson impurity model at the onset of Kondo physics. Our results reveal a distinct signature of one dimensional leads in the noise and Fano factor not present for other dimensionalities, showing the potential of FCS measurements as a probe of the environment surrounding a quantum dot.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Magnetic State Configurations in Nanotubes with FMR spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanotubes have garnered immense attention for their potential in high-density magnetic memory, owing to their stable flux closure configuration and fast, reproducible reversal processes. However, characterizing their magnetic configuration through straightforward methodologies remains a challenge in both scope and detail. Here, we elucidate the magnetic state details using Remanence Field Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (RFMR) for arrays of electrodeposited nanotubes. Micromagnetic simulations revealed distinct spin configurations while coming from saturation, including the edge vortex, onion, uniform and curling states, with chirality variations depending on the preparation field direction. Dynamic measurements, coupled with RFMR spectra analysis, unveiled multiple FMR modes corresponding to these spin configurations. The evolution of spin configurations under bias fields were studied, indicating nucleation within the curling state. Observations revealed opposite RFMR spectra, denoting opposite magnetic spin configurations after removing the positive and negative saturating fields when the magnetic field was applied along {theta_H=0} and perpendicular {theta_H= 90} to the nanotube axis. We observed a mixture of the non-uniform curling states with the end vortex state (onion-like curling state) at the end of the nanotubes for the theta_H=0(90) and uniform magnetization states in the middle of the nanotubes for the theta_H=0 configuration. Building on RFMR information, frequency-swept FMR absorption spectra obtained at different bias fields allowed the characterization of magnetization states. This picture was supported by micromagnetic simulations. These findings were further substantiated with First Order Reversal Curve measurements (FORC).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear planar magnetotransport as a probe of the quantum geometry of topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently established that transport measurements in the nonlinear regime can give direct access to the quantum metric (QM): the real part of the quantum geometric tensor characterizing the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid. In topological materials, the QM has been so far revealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where it provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the driving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong three-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from the nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally applied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while coexisting with the extrinsic part generating the so-called bilinear magnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear transport arise both in topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ materials class and in the series of cubic mercury chalcogenides as a result of the combined action of the Zeeman coupling with hexagonal warping and particle-hole symmetry breaking effects respectively.</description>

      <title>Reorientation transition between square and hexagonal skyrmion lattices near the saturation into the homogeneous state in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I revisit the well-known phase transition between the hexagonal skyrmion lattice and the homogeneous state within the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii theory for chiral magnets which includes only the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Zeeman energy contributions. I show that, in a narrow field range near the saturation field, the hexagonal skyrmion order gradually transforms into a square arrangement of skyrmions. Then, by the second-order phase transition during which the lattice period diverges, the square skyrmion lattice releases a set of repulsive isolated skyrmions. On decreasing magnetic field, isolated skyrmions re-condense into the square lattice at the same critical field as soon as their eigen-energy becomes negative with respect to the field-aligned state. The underlying reason of the reorientation transition between two skyrmion orders can be deduced from the energy density distribution within isolated skyrmions surrounded by the homogeneous state. When the negative energy within the ring-shaped area at the skyrmion outskirt outweighs the positive energy amount around the skyrmion axis, skyrmions tend to form the square lattice, in which the overlap of skyrmion profiles results in smaller energy losses as compared with the hexagonal crystal. With the further decreasing field, the hexagonal lattice achieves smaller energy density in comparison with the square one due to the denser packing of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Observation of electrical high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), an extreme nonlinear effect, introduces an unprecedented paradigm to detect emergent quantum phases and electron dynamics inconceivable in the framework of linear and low-order nonlinear processes. As an important manifestation, the optical HHG (o-HHG) enables extraordinary opportunities to underpin attosecond physics. In addition to nonlinear optics, emerging nonlinear electric transport has been demonstrated recently and opens new paradigms to probe quantum phase transition, symmetry breaking, band geometrical and topological properties. Thus far, only electrical second-/third-harmonic generation in perturbative regime has been elucidated, while the electrical HHG (e-HHG) that can advance to extreme non-perturbative physics remains elusive. Here we report the observation of e-HHG up to 300th-order. Remarkably, the e-HHG shows a clear non-perturbative character and exhibits periodic oscillations with the reciprocal of driving current. Further, theoretical simulations corroborate the experiments, suggesting the contribution of singular distribution of Berry curvature near band edges. Our results demonstrate e-HHG in extreme nonlinear regime and may shed light on a plethora of exotic physics and applications, such as extreme non-equilibrium quantum phenomena, ultra-fast and coherent electrical signal generations and detections.</description>

      <title>Rapid infrared imaging for rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extrinsic stacking sequence based on intrinsic crystal symmetry in multilayer two-dimensional materials plays a significant role in determining their electronic and optical properties. Compared with Bernal-stacked (ABA) multilayer graphene, rhombohedral (ABC) multilayer graphene hosts stronger electron-electron interaction due to its unique dispersion at low-energy excitations and has been utiliazed as a unique platform to explore strongly correlated physics. However, discerning the stacking sequence has always been a quite time-consuming process by scanning mapping methods. Here, we report a rapid recognition method for ABC- stacked graphene with high accuracy by infrared imaging based on the distinct optical responses at infrared range. The optical contrast of the image between ABC and ABA stacked graphene is strikingly clear, and the discernibility is comparable to traditional optical Raman microscopy but with higher consistency and throughput. We further demonstrate that the infrared imaging technique can be integrated with dry transfer techniques commonly used in the community. This rapid and convenient infrared imaging technique will significantly improve the sorting efficiency for differently stacked multilayer graphene, thereby accelerating the exploration of the novel emergent correlated phenomena in ABC stacked graphene.</description>

      <title>Induced charge generated by a Coulomb impurity in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate analytically the charge density $\rho_{\text{ind}}(\boldsymbol{r})$ at small distances induced by a Coulomb impurity in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. The calculations were performed exactly in the coupling constant. We found the first three leading terms of the charge density asymptotics at small distances. Using this result, we demonstrate that the impurity with charge number $Z=1$ remains subcritical at any value of the coupling constant, whereas impurities with higher charge number could become supercritical at certain coupling constant values. Such a behavior is similar to that in graphene.</description>

      <title>Arrays of one-dimensional conducting channels in minimally twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimally twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with interlayer potential asymmetry host one-dimensional (1D) topological helical states (THSs) at domain walls between AB/BA stacking regions. However, the nature of THS propagation remains elusive. Although it is widely believed that they form a two-dimensional (2D) triangular network, a few argue that they self-organize into 1D topological zigzag modes (TZMs) that propagate independently. In this Letter, we propose a protocol based on a two-terminal TBG nanoflake transport device and resolve this issue. Through rigorous calculations on the differential conductance and the nonequilibrium local density of states, we show that, these THSs indeed self-construct the 1D distorted TZMs, each bypassing the AA-stacking spots and propagating independently. By considering a long TBG nanoflake, we obtain a nearly quantized conductance plateau with its value close to 1, 2, and 3 (in units of $2e^2/h$), which serves as a strong experimental sign for the existence of TZMs. Our work not only clarifies the propagation nature of the THSs, but also realizes an array of 1D conducting channels on a 2D platform. This work provides an unprecedented way to engineering topological states intrinsic in TBG.</description>

      <title>Magnetophotogalvanic Effects Driven by Terahertz Radiation in CdHgTe Crystals with Kane Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation and comprehensive study of the terahertz radiation induced magneto-photogalvanic effect (MPGE) in bulk CdHgTe crystals hosting Kane fermions. The MPGE has been detected in Cd$_{x}$Hg$_{1-x}$Te films with Cd contents $x = 0.15$ and $0.22$ subjected to an in-plane magnetic field. At liquid helium temperature we observed multiple resonances in MPGE current upon variation of magnetic field. In the $x = 0.22$ with noninverted band structure, the resonances are caused by cyclotron resonance (CR) and photoionization of an impurity level. In the $x = 0.15$ films with an inverted band structure, they originate from the CR and interband optical transitions. Band structure calculated by the Kane model perfectly describes positions of all resonances. In particularly, the resonant MPGE caused by interband transitions excited by THz radiation is caused by the gapless energy spectrum of Kane fermions realized in materials with certain Cd contents and temperature range. In addition to the resonant MPGE current we detected a nonresonant one due to indirect optical transitions (Drude-like). This contribution has a nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence increasing linearly at low magnetic field $B$, approaching a maximum at moderate field and decreasing at high $B$. While the nonresonant MPGE decreases drastically with increasing temperature, it is well measurable up to room temperature. The developed theory demonstrates that the MPGE current arises due to cubic in momentum spin-dependent terms in the scattering probability. The asymmetry caused by these effects results in a pure spin current which is converted into an electric current due to the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic materials exhibit strong magneto-optic effects and high tunability by electrostatic gating, making them very attractive for new magneto-photonic devices. Here, we characterize the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) spectrum of thin Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ from 1.13 to 2.67 eV, and demonstrate electrostatic control over of its magnetic and magneto-optic properties. The MOKE spectrum exhibits a strong feature around 1.43 eV which we attribute to a magnetic exchange-split excitonic state in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, in agreement with \textit{ab-initio} calculations. The gate dependence of the MOKE signals shows that the magneto-optical efficiency - rather than the saturation magnetization - is affected by electrostatic gating. We demonstrate a modulation of the magneto-optical strength by over 1 mdeg, with some wavelengths showing a modulation of 65% of the total magneto-optical signals, opening the door for efficient electrical control over light polarization through two-dimensional magnets. Our findings bring forward the fundamental understanding of magneto-optic processes in two-dimensional magnets and are highly relevant for the engineering of devices which exploit excitonic resonances for electrically-tunable magneto-photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetically modulated superconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) Josephson junctions and their tunability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based Josephson junctions played an important role in various quantum devices from their inception. Magnetic tunnel junctions or vertical devices were also made out of graphene by exposing the graphene layer to localised pattern of strong magnetic field created by hard ferromagnetic material. By combining the essence of these different methods for constructing graphene based junctions, in this work we propose that the temperature-dependent Josephson current in such junctions can be tuned by exposing the graphene regions to a combination of highly localised non-uniform magnetic field, dubbed as magnetic barrier, and spatially modulated gate voltage. Within the framework of Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (DBDG) theory, we show by explicit calculation that in such magnetically modulated Josephson Junctions, the band structure of graphene gets significantly altered, which results in the change of the Andreev reflections in such junctions. This leads to a significant modulation of the Josephson current. We numerically evaluated the Josephson current as a function of the strength of the magnetic barrier and the gate voltage and discussed the practical consequences of such controlling of Josephson currents.</description>

      <title>Goos-H\"anchen shift of inelastically scattered spin-wave beams and cascade nonlinear excitation of spin-wave leaky modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, by means of micromagnetic simulations, inelastic scattering of spin-wave beams on edge-localized spin waves modes. The outcome of the investigated inelastic scattering is creation of new spin-waves beams of frequencies shifted by the edge mode frequencies. We report that inelastically scattered spin-wave beams in both stimulated splitting and confluence processes not only change their direction of propagation, but also undergo lateral shifts along the interface, analogous to the Goos-H\"anchen effect. We report that the lateral shifts of inelastically scattered beams can be much larger than the classical Goos-H\"anchen shifts for reflected spin waves, taking both positive and negative values. In addition, we report the cascade nonlinear excitation of spin-wave leaky modes accompanied by a substantial increase in the value of the lateral shift of the inelastically scattered spin-wave beam in the confluence process. Our results are an important contribution to the understanding of the nonlinear nature of spin waves, which is crucial for spin wave applications.</description>

      <title>The fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an analytical explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall coexistence phases in higher Landau levels of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer graphene under a strong magnetic field near charge neutrality manifests the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. Since only some of the four spin/valley flavors available to the electrons in each Landau level manifold are filled, they also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking the in spin/valley sector, a phenomenon known as quantum Hall ferromagnetism. In this work, we study quantum Hall ferromagnets in the higher Landau level manifolds of monolayer graphene and show that there is an even richer set of symmetry-broken phases than in the lowest Landau level manifold. Specifically, both valley polarized and valley equatorial (where the occupied Landau levels are in an equal superposition of both valleys) ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and canted antiferromagnets are found. Several types of spin valley entangled phases are found, all of which manifest the simultaneous spontaneous symmetry breaking of both magnetic and lattice symmetries.</description>

      <title>Current-Induced Circular Dichroism on Metallic Surfaces: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use {\it ab initio} calculations to understand the current-induced optical response and orbital moment accumulation at the surfaces of metallic films. These two quantities are related by a sum rule that equates the circular dichroic absorption integrated over frequency to the gauge-invariant self-rotation contribution to the orbital magnetization, $\vec{M}_{\rm SR}$. In typical ferromagnets, $\vec{M}_{\rm SR}$ is a good approximation to the total orbital magnetization. We compute the current-induced $\vec{M}_{\rm SR}$ for a Pt thin film and compare it to the current-induced orbital moment accumulation calculated with the atom-centered approximation (ACA). We find significant differences: the size of $\vec{M}_{\rm SR}$ is, in general, larger than the ACA orbital moment accumulation by an order of magnitude and includes substantial finite-size effects. The differences between the two quantities caution against interpreting optical measurements with models utilizing the ACA. Finally, we compute the total $\vec{M}_{\rm SR}$ and ACA orbital moment accumulation as a function of layer thickness. For both quantities, the length scale at which the total surface accumulation saturates is on the order of the mean free path and longer than the length scale of their spatial profiles.</description>

      <title>Interplay of electronic crystals with integer and fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e pentalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of moir\'e quantum matter has recently led to the remarkable discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, and sparked predictions of other novel correlation-driven topological states. Here, we investigate the interplay of electronic crystals with integer and fractional Chern insulators in a moir\'e lattice of rhomobohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At a doping of one electron per moir\'e unit cell, we see a correlated insulator with a Chern number that can be tuned between $C=0$ and $+1$ by an electric displacement field, accompanied by an array of other such insulators formed at fractional band fillings, $\nu$. Collectively, these states likely correspond to trivial and topological electronic crystals, some of which spontaneously break the discrete translational symmetry of the moir\'e lattice. Upon applying a modest magnetic field, a narrow region forms around $\nu=2/3$ in which transport measurements imply the emergence of a fractional Chern insulator, along with hints of weaker states at other fractional $\nu$. In the same sample, we also see a unique sequence of incipient Chern insulators arising over a broad range of incommensurate band filling near two holes per moir\'e unit cell. Our results establish moir\'e RPG as a fertile platform for studying the competition and potential intertwining of electronic crystallization and topological charge fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Angstrom-scale ion-beam engineering of ultrathin buried oxides for quantum and neuro-inspired computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

      <title>Intervalley mixing of interface excitons at lateral heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$ We demonstrate that the low symmetry of armchair lateral heterojunction between transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers allows for the mixing of $\mathbf{K}_+$ and $\mathbf{K}_-$ valleys. From the tight binding model we estimate the strength of the valley coupling to be of the order of $0.2$ eV$\cdot{\AA}$ for typical heteropairs. We show that the valley mixing gives rise to the in-plane $g$-factor of localized electrons leading to the spin precession in the in-plane magnetic field. We further study the effects of the valley mixing on the fine structure and dynamics of excitons at type-II lateral heterojunctions. We find that the interplay of the valley mixing and long-range exchange interaction leads to the linear polarization of exciton photoluminescence along the armchair heterojunction with the degree of polarization up to $1/3$ under unpolarized excitation. Application of the in-plane magnetic field of the order of 10$-$100 mT in any direction leads to the depolarization of the photoluminescence.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and spin canting in spin-orbit proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide flat-band systems show similar phase diagrams, replete with magnetic and superconducting phases. An abiding question has been whether magnetic ordering competes with superconductivity or facilitates pairing. The advent of crystalline graphene superconductors enables a new generation of controlled experiments to probe the microscopic origin of superconductivity. For example, recent studies of Bernal bilayer graphene show a dramatic increase in the observed domain and critical temperature $T_c$ of superconducting states in the presence of enhanced spin-orbit coupling; the mechanism for this enhancement, however, remains unclear. Here, we show that introducing spin-orbit coupling in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) via substrate proximity effect generates new superconducting pockets for both electron and hole doping, with maximal $T_c\approx$ 300mK three times larger than in RTG encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride alone. Using local magnetometry and thermodynamic compressibility measurements, we show that superconductivity straddles an apparently continuous transition between a spin-canted state with a finite in-plane magnetic moment and a state with complete spin-valley locking. This transition is reproduced in our Hartree-Fock calculations, where it is driven by the competition between spin-orbit coupling and the carrier-density-tuned Hund's interaction. Our experiment suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by spin-orbit coupling is driven not by a change in the ground state symmetry or degeneracy but rather by a quantitative change in the canting angle. These results align with a recently proposed mechanism for the enhancement of superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled rhombohedral multilayers, in which fluctuations in the spin-canting order contribute to the pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>Extended Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in topological flat bands can form novel topological states driven by the correlation effects. The penta-layer rhombohedral graphene/hBN moire superlattice has been shown to host fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) at ~400 mK, triggering discussions around the underlying mechanism and the role of moire effects. In particular, novel electron crystal states with non-trivial topology have been proposed. Here we report DC electrical transport measurement in rhombohedral penta- and tetra-layer graphene/hBN moire superlattices at electronic temperatures down to ~40 mK. We observed two more FQAH states in the penta-layer devices than previously reported. In a new tetra-layer device, we observed FQAHE at filling factors v = 3/5 and 2/3 at 300 mK. With a small bias current and the lowest temperature, we observed a new extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) state and magnetic hysteresis, where Rxy = h/e2 and vanishing Rxx span a wide range of moire filling factor v from 0.5 to up to 1.3. By increasing the temperature or current, FQAHE can be recovered -- suggesting the break-down of the EQAH states and a phase transition into the fractional quantum Hall liquid. Furthermore, we observed displacement field-induced quantum phase transitions from the EQAH states to Fermi liquid, FQAH liquid and the likely composite Fermi liquid. Our observation establishes a new topological phase of electrons with quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field, and enriches the emergent quantum phenomena in materials with topological flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and characterize a novel two-dimensional material, 2D-CRO, derived from bulk calcium-based ruthenates (CROs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, Ca$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n = 1$ and $2$). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer limit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic properties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by zero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through dimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion symmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the absence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and computational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both with and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that contribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO as a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and topological features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a particularly useful quantum resource, which finds broad applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and sensing, and biological measurements. It has been successfully generated in various physical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce squeezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we adopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports both linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity photons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can induce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role of the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and improving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results indicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials with high exciton binding energy.</description>

      <title>Interplay of phonon directionality and emission polarization in two-dimensional layered metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With polarized and angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy studies on single two-dimensional layered perovskites (2DLP) flakes with different ammonium molecules as organic cations, in 2020 we revealed the very rich phonon spectra in the low-frequency regime. Although the phonon bands at low frequency can generally be attributed to the vibrations of the inorganic lattice, we found very different phonon spectra for the same lead-bromide octahedra composition by only changing the type of the organic cations. In addition, the intensity of the different phonon modes depended strongly on the angle of the linearly polarized excitation beam with respect to the in-plane axes of the octahedra lattice. In 2022, we mapped this angular dependence of the phonon modes, which enabled to identify the directionality of the different lattice vibrations. By correlating the phonon spectra with the temperature-dependent emission for a set of 2DLPs that featured very different STE emission, we demonstrated that the exciton relaxation cannot be related to coupling with a single (longitudinal optical) phonon band, and that several phonon bands should be involved in the emission process. We performed angle-resolved polarized emission and Raman spectroscopy on the same two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite microcrystals, which revealed the impact of the organic cations on the linear polarization of the emission, and corroborated our interpretation that multiple phonon bands should be involved in the radiative recombination process. Our studies revealed a wealth of highly directional low-frequency phonons in 2DLPs from which several bands are involved in the emission process, which leads to diverse optical and vibrational properties depending on the type of organic cation in the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The thus obtained microscopy images compliment the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach is extendible to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the fusion rules of Majorana Kramers pairs in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors. We find that the fusion of Majorana Kramers pairs is a process that Ising anyons fuse independently in the two distinct time-reversal sectors. Considering the full fusion including the initialization and the fusion, we explore the observation of a supersymmetry that emerges in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors, and design the schemes for the nontrivial fusion and the trivial fusion to show the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana Kramers pairs. We also show the possible influence of local adiabatic mixing on the fusion and the differentiation between distinct fusion processes remains feasible even in the presence of such mixing. Our proposals are applied in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave topological superconductors, and the theoretical framework can be extended to the fusion of multiple Majorana zero modes protected by unitary symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between two ferromagnets separated by a superconductor has been mostly investigated for the case of Cooper pairs with spin-singlet symmetry. Here, we consider a spin-triplet superconductor with chiral pairing. By full self-consistent analysis of the spatial dependent superconducting order parameter, we determine the magnetic ground state of the superconducting spin valve. The study is performed by investigating the role of the orientation and strength of the magnetization in the ferromagnets including spin-valve asymmetries in the magnetic configurations. Due to the nonvanishing angular momentum of the spin-triplet Cooper pairs we demonstrate that the induced magnetic coupling has an anisotropic character and a structure that can favor collinear or noncollinear magnetic orientations, thus mimicking a magnetic interaction of the Heisenberg or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type, respectively. We investigate the role of the physical parameters controlling the character of the magnetic exchange: the amplitude of the magnetization in the ferromagnets and the length of the superconducting spacer in the spin valve. Our study demonstrates that spin-triplet superconductors can be employed to devise anisotropic magnetic exchange and to allow for transitions in the spin-valve state from a collinear to noncollinear magnetic configuration.</description>

      <title>Tunable interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling in asymmetric AlxIn1-xSb/InSb/CdTe quantum well heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in molecular beam epitaxy-grown AlxIn1-xSb/InSb/CdTe quantum well heterostructures is reported. The effective band bending provides robust two-dimensional quantum confinement, while the unidirectional built-in electric field from the asymmetric hetero-interfaces results in pronounced Rashba SOC strength. By tuning the Al concentration in the top AlxIn1-xSb barrier layer, the optimal structure with x = 0.15 shows the largest Rashba coefficient of 0.23 eV-Angstrom. and the highest low-temperature electron mobility of 4400 cm^2/Vs . Quantitative investigations of the weak anti-localization effect further confirm the dominant D'yakonov-Perel (DP) spin relaxation mechanism during charge-to-spin conversion. These findings highlight the significance of quantum well engineering in shaping magneto-resistance responses, and narrow bandgap semiconductor-based heterostructures may offer a reliable platform for energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Gapless spin excitations in nanographene-based antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haldane's seminal work established two fundamentally different types of excitation spectra for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin chains: gapped excitations in integer-spin chains and gapless excitations in half-integer-spin chains. In finite-length half-integer spin chains, quantization, however, induces a gap in the excitation spectrum, with the upper bound given by the Lieb-Schulz-Mattis (LSM) theorem. Here, we investigate the length-dependent excitations in spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains obtained by covalently linking olympicenes--Olympic rings shaped nanographenes carrying spin-1/2--into one-dimensional chains. The large exchange interaction (J~38 mV) between olympicenes and the negligible magnetic anisotropy in these nanographenes make them an ideal platform for studying quantum spin excitations, which we directly measure using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. We observe a power-law decay of the lowest excitation energy with increasing chain length L, remaining below the LSM boundary. In a long chain with L = 50, a nearly V-shaped excitation continuum is observed, reinforcing the system's gapless nature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we visualize the standing wave of a single spinon confined in odd-numbered chains using low-bias current maps. Our results provide compelling evidence for the realization of a one-dimensional analog of a gapless spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Excitonic-trion population in two-dimensional halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many reports of a surprisingly high charge-carrier density with sizable mobility in photo-excited two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites despite their unusually high exciton binding-energy. In this work we study the thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium of the relative population of photoexcited free quasi-electron/quasi-hole pairs, neutral-excitons and excitonic trions, in 2D materials that support such excitonic complexes with large binding energy. We derive and solve the general Saha equations which describe the detailed balance of such a system of photo-excited electronic degrees of freedom forming a multi-component fluid of excitations in thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium.The solution to these equations, for the special case of 2D perovskites where the reported exciton and excitonic trion binding-energies are of the order of 0.3-0.4 eV for the former and 30-40 meV for the latter, reveals that while the charge-neutral excitonic population dominates all other excitations, at room temperature and below, the excitonic trion component can be the dominant population among charge carriers. We also argue that trionic hopping can take place via a tunneling mechanism which is speculated to play a role in a novel charge-transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary order transfer matrix exceptional points and van Hove singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lattice models with quadratic finite-range Hermitian Hamiltonians, the inherently non-Hermitian transfer matrix (TM) governs the band dispersion. The van Hove singularities (VHSs) are special points in the band dispersion where the density of states (DOS) diverge. Considering a lattice chain with hopping of a finite range $n$, we find a direct fundamental connection between VHSs and exceptional points (EPs) of TM, both of arbitrary order. In particular, we show that VHSs are EPs of TM of the same order, thereby connecting two different types of critical points usually studied in widely different branches of physics. Consequently, several properties of band dispersion and VHSs can be analyzed in terms of spectral properties of TM. We further provide a general prescription to generate any order EP of the TM and therefore corresponding VHS. For a given range of hopping $n$, our analysis provides restrictions on allowed orders of EPs of TM. Finally, we exemplify all our results for the case $n=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a solid state qubit defined on valley isospin of an electron confined in a gate-defined quantum dot created in an area of monolayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ lateral junction, where a steep dipolar potential emerges. We show that the junction oriented along an armchair direction can induce intervalley transitions of the electron confined in the neighboring quantum dot when the (gate-controllable) overlapping with the junction is significant and pumping frequency tuned. The pumping scheme that induces transitions is all-electrical: obtained by applying oscillating voltages to control gates and thus enables for scalable qubit architectures. We also report another possibility of valley-qubit manipulation by accumulating non-Abelian valley Berry phase. To model nanodevice we solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations in a tight-binding approach and obtain exact time-evolution of the valley-qubit system.</description>

      <title>Shot noise as a diagnostic in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall edge zoo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\nu = 2/3$ filling is the simplest paradigmatic example of a fractional quantum Hall state, which contains counter-propagating edge modes. These modes can be either in the unequilibrated regime or equilibrated to different extents, on top of a possible edge reconstruction. In the unequilibrated regime, two distinct renormalization group fixed points have been previously proposed, namely Kane-Fischer-Polchinski and Wang-Meir-Gefen. In the equilibration regime, different degree of thermal equilibration may occur, while charge is fully equilibrated. Here, we show that this rich variety of models can give rise to three possible conductance plateaus at $e^2/2h$ (recently observed in experiments), $5e^2/9h$ (predicted here), and $e^2/3h$ (observed earlier in experiments) in a quantum point contact geometry. We identify different mechanisms for \emph{electrical shot noise} generation at these plateaus, which provides an experimentally accessible venue for distinguishing among the distinct models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description. Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

      <title>Fractional Topological Charges in 2D Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are characterised by an integer topological charge $\mathcal Q =\mp 1$, describing the winding of the magnetic orientation. Half-integer winding numbers, $\mathcal Q=\pm \frac{1}{2}$, can be obtained for magnetic vortices (merons). Here, we discuss the physics of magnets with fractional topological charge which is neither integer nor half-integer. We argue that in ferromagnetic films with cubic anisotropy, textures with $\mathcal Q=\pm\frac{1}{6} $ or $\pm\frac{1}{8}$ arise naturally when three or more magnetic domains meet. We also show that a single magnetic skyrmion with $\mathcal Q =-1$ can explode into four fractional defects, each carrying charge $\mathcal Q=-\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we investigate a point defect with a non-quantised fractional charge ($\mathcal Q\neq \frac{n}{m}, n,m\in\mathbb{Z}$) which can move parallel to a magnetic domain wall. Only defects with fractional charge lead to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for magnons. We investigate the resulting forces on a fractional defect due to magnon currents.</description>

Abstract: We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of single channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise protected qubits, which map to the bifluxon and $0{-}\pi$ qubits in the tunneling regime. We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description of these quantum circuits dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are time-reversal broken antiferromagnets, where the $z$ component of the N\'{e}el vector is detectable by anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, recently proposed $p$-wave magnets are time-reversal preserved antiferromagnets, and it is a highly nontrivial problem how to detect and control a domain wall. We study a one-dimensional hybrid system made of a $p$-wave magnet and a metal possessing the orbital degree of freedom. The hybrid system is a topological insulator without the spin-orbit interaction. There emerge two edge states per one edge, because the system is mapped to a set of two copies of a topological insulator. Each copy resembles the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but it is topologically different. Topological interface states emerge at a domain wall in the $p$-wave magnet, which are charged due to the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. Consequently, a domain wall in the $p$-wave magnet will be controllable and detectable purely by electrical means. We also study Majorana fermions induced by proximity coupling of $s$-wave superconductivity and $p$-wave magnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor moir\'e systems, characterized by their periodic spatial light emission, unveil a new paradigm of active metasurfaces. Here, we show that ferroelectric moir\'e domains formed in a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN) substrate can modulate light emission from an adjacent semiconductor MoSe$_2$ monolayer, enhancing its functionality as an active metasurface. The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe$_2$ monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated due to a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a novel functionality beyond conventional semiconductor moir\'e systems. Our findings chart an exciting pathway for integrating nanometer-scale moir\'e ferroelectric domains with various optically active functional layers, paving the way for advanced nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, based on the quantum kinetic equation approach, we systematically present the radio-electric effect in asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells under the influence of a laser radiation field taking into account the electron-longitudinal optical phonon scattering mechanism. The numerical results show that the blue-shift of the maximum peaks in the photon energy range is less than 60 meV. The height of maximum peaks increases according to an exponential rule, depending nonlinearly on the structural parameters of the asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells. In the photon energy range greater than 100 meV, the saturated radio-electric field increases with temperature and geometric parameters of the quantum well. Temperature also strongly affects full-width at half-maximum with rules consistent with previous theoretical calculations and experimental observations. The results show the differences between symmetric and asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells, highlighting the influence of asymmetric structures on radio-electric effects in two-dimensional quantum well systems.</description>

Abstract: InAs semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the near infrared are promising platforms for on-demand single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces. However, the realization of quantum-photonic nanodevices emitting in the second and third telecom windows with similar performance remains an open challenge. Here, we report an optimized heterostructure design for QDs emitting in the O- and C-bands grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy. The InAs QDs are grown on compositionally graded InGaAs buffers, which act as virtual substrates, and are embedded in mostly relaxed active regions. Reciprocal space maps of the indium profiles and optical absorption spectra are used to optimize In0.22Ga0.78As and In0.30Ga0.70As active regions, accounting for the chosen indium grading profile. This approach results in a tunable QD photoluminescence (PL) emission from 1200 up to 1600 nm. Power and polarization dependent micro-PL measurements performed at 4 K reveal exciton-biexciton complexes from quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C-bands. The presented study establishes a flexible platform that can be an essential component for advanced photonic devices based on InAs/GaAs that serve as building blocks for future quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: A quantum system interacting with a time-periodic excitation creates a ladder of hybrid eigenstates in which the system is mixed with an increasing number of photons. This mechanism, referred to as dressing, has been observed in the context of light-matter interaction in systems as varied as atoms, molecules and solid-state qubits. In this work, we demonstrate state dressing in a semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We observe the emergence of a Floquet ladder of states in the system's high-frequency electrical response, manifesting as interference fringes at the multiphoton resonances despite the system lacking an avoided crossing. We study the dressed quantum dot while changing reservoir temperature, charge lifetime, and excitation amplitude and reveal the fundamental nature of the mechanism by developing a theory based on the quantum dynamics of the Floquet ladder, which is in excellent agreement with the data. Furthermore, we show how the technique finds applications in the accurate electrostatic characterisation of semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Spin chirality and fermion stirring in topological bands</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that in metals, both normal and superconducting, orbital currents present in the ground state when time reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken, generate spin chirality. Nonzero chirality can emerge in the absence of any spin-dependent interactions, even when the ground state remains spin-unpolarized. The chirality effect is derived diagrammatically and illustrated for Haldane model and the topological superconductivity problem. Chirality in the carrier band results in a chiral three-spin RKKY interaction between localized spins coupled to carriers by s-d Hamiltonian, an effect that can be detected by local probes such as spin-sensitive STM. In systems where detecting TRS breaking by conventional means is challenging, such as topological superconductors, local detection of spin chirality can serve as a reliable diagnostic of superconducting topological phases.</description>

      <title>Majorana's approach to nonadiabatic transitions validates the adiabatic-impulse approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The approach by Ettore Majorana for non-adiabatic transitions between two quasi-crossing levels is revisited. We rederive the transition probability, known as the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana formula, and introduce Majorana's approach to modern readers. This result typically referred as the Landau-Zener formula, was published by Majorana before Landau, Zener, St\"{u}ckelberg. Moreover, we obtain the full wave function, including its phase, which is important nowadays for quantum control and quantum information. The asymptotic wave function correctly describes dynamics far from the avoided-level crossing, while it has limited accuracy in that region.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene I: Interaction-Driven Chern Bands and Fractional Quantum Hall States at Zero Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene flakes with a substrate induced moir\'e potential have identified both Chern insulators and fractional Quantum Hall states in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Surprisingly, these states are observed in strong displacement fields where the effects of the moir\'e lattice are weak, and seem to be readily accessed without fine-tuning. To address these experimental puzzles we study an interacting model of electrons in this geometry, first within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. We find an isolated Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$, that moreover is relatively flat and shows good quantum geometry. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods at fractional filling establish the presence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states. The $|C|=1$ band in SCHF is remarkably robust to varying microscopic parameters, and is also found in the $N_L=4$ and $N_L=6$ layer systems. Remarkably, it appears stable even to switching off the moir\'e potential, pointing to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We term this topological crystalline state the ``anomalous Hall crystal" (AHC), and argue that it constitutes a general mechanism for creating stable Chern bands in rhombohedral graphene. Our work elucidates the physics behind the recent rhombohedral pentalayer graphene observations, predicts the appearance of the same phase in other systems, and opens the door to studying the interplay between electronic topology and spontaneous translation symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Reduced decay in Josephson coupling across ferromagnetic junctions with spin-orbit coupling layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of $S_z=1$ triplet Cooper pairs has been predicted theoretically in superconducting-ferromagnetic hybrid heterostructures in the presence of spin-orbit coupling [F. S. Bergeret and I. V. Tokatly, Phys. Rev. B 89, 134517 (2014) and Jacobsen et al., Sci. Rep. 6, 23926 (2016)]. In this study, we experimentally investigate vertical Josephson junctions where the weak link is formed from a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy sandwiched by two non-magnetic layers with weak or strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that the decay of the Josephson coupling is reduced in the latter case, possibly indicating the presence of $S_z=1$ spin-triplet correlations. We speculate that the canted magnetization required for these correlations is provided by the interaction of magnetization with Meissner effect in the superconducting layers.</description>
