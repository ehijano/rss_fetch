      <title>Construction of symplectic systems from parameter-drift Hamiltonian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the symplectic nature of parameter-drift maps by embedding them into extended phase space. Applying the embedding to the parameter-drift standard nontwist map, our construction yields an autonomous symplectic map in extended phase space that preserves key dynamics of the original system. Computing finite time Lyapunov exponents, the symplectic map shows limitations of ensemble-based diagnostics, common in the parameter-drift literature, and provides new insights into transport phenomena in these nonautonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Resonance and chaos in the stochastic Mackey-Glass equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study focuses on noise-induced phenomena in stochastic Mackey-Glass equations. In the weak nonlinearity region, the standard stochastic resonances (SRs) switching between two point, periodic, and chaotic attractors are observed with the negative largest Lyapunov exponent. The numerically computed resonant period deviates from the classical estimation based on time delays and we provide a more precise estimation based on a linear mode analysis of the existing unstable spiral. In the strong nonlinearity region, we newly discover high-dimensional chaotic SR with multiple positive Lyapunov exponents, which has not been previously reported. Unlike the dynamics in the weak nonlinearity region, the point of resonance precedes the zero-crossing point of the largest Lyapunov exponent, resulting in the coexistence of high-dimensional stochastic chaos and SR.</description>

      <title>Self-Replication of Turbulent Puffs: On the edge between chaotic saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pipe flow is a canonical example of a subcritical flow, the transition to turbulence requiring a finite perturbation. The Reynolds number ($Re$) serves as the control parameter for this transition, going from the ordered (laminar) to the chaotic (turbulent) phase with increasing $Re$. Just above the critical $Re$, where turbulence can be sustained indefinitely, turbulence spreads via the self-replication of localized turbulent structures called puffs. To reveal the workings behind this process, we consider transitions between one and two-puff states, which dynamically are transitions between two distinct chaotic saddles. We use direct numerical simulations to explore the phase space boundary between these saddles, adapting a bisection algorithm to identify an attracting state on the boundary, termed an edge state. At $Re = 2200$, we also examine spontaneous transitions between the two saddles, demonstrating the relevance of the found edge state to puff self-replication. Our analysis reveals that the process of self-replication follows a previously proposed splitting mechanism, with the found edge state as its tipping point. Additionally, we report results for lower values of $Re$, where the bisection algorithm yields a different type of edge state. As we cannot directly observe splits at this $Re$, the self-replication mechanism here remains an open question. Our analysis suggests how this question could be addressed in future studies, and paves the way to probing the turbulence proliferation mechanism in other subcritical flows.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig mode decomposition: Comparison with time-delay embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Mori-Zwanzig Mode Decomposition (MZMD), a novel data-driven technique for efficient modal analysis of and reduced-order modeling of large-scale spatio-temporal dynamical systems. MZMD represents an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by providing an approximate closure term with MZ memory kernels accounting for how the unresolved modes of DMD interact with the resolved modes, thus addressing limitations when the state-space observables do not form a Koopman-invariant subspace. Leveraging the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism, MZMD identifies the modes and spectrum of the discrete-time Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE); an integro-differential equation that governs the dynamics of selected observables and their memory-dependent coupling with the unresolved degrees of freedom. This feature fundamentally distinguishes MZMD from time-delay embedding methods, such as Higher-Order DMD (HODMD). In this work, we derive and analyze MZMD and compare it with DMD and HODMD, using two exemplary Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) datasets: a 2D flow over a cylinder (as validation) and laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition over a flared cone at Mach 6. We demonstrate that MZMD, via the addition of MZ memory terms, improves the resolution of spatio-temporal structures within the transitional/turbulent regime by the introduction of transient and periodic modes (not captured by DMD), which contain features that arise due to nonlinear mechanisms, such as the generation of the so-called hot streaks on the surface of the flared cone. Our results demonstrate that MZMD serves as an efficient generalization of DMD (reducing to DMD in the absence of memory), improves stability, and exhibits greater robustness and resistance to overfitting compared to HODMD.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium fluxes shape the self-organization of locally-interacting turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the self-organization of turbulence in a geophysically motivated two-dimensional fluid with local interactions. Using simulations and theory, we show that the out-of-equilibrium flux to small scales imposes a constraint on the large-scale emergent flow. Consequently, a rich phase diagram of large-scale configurations emerges, replacing the unique state found in flows with energy injection below the interaction scale. We explain what sets the boundaries between the different phases, and the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates that the selection mechanism of large-scale structures in quasi-geostrophic flows can be dramatically altered by forcing above the interaction scale.</description>
