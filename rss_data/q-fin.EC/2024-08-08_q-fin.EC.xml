      <title>"The Strength of Weak Ties" Varies Across Viral Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of novel information through social networks is essential for dismantling echo chambers and promoting innovation. Our study examines how two major types of viral channels, specifically Direct Messaging (DM) and Broadcasting (BC), impact the well-known "strength of weak ties" in disseminating novel information across social networks. We conducted a large-scale empirical analysis, examining the sharing behavior of 500,000 users over a two-month period on a major social media platform. Our results suggest a greater capacity for DM to transmit novel information compared to BC, although DM typically involves stronger ties. Furthermore, the "strength of weak ties" is only evident in BC, not in DM where weaker ties do not transmit significantly more novel information. Our mechanism analysis indicates that the content selection by both senders and recipients, contingent on tie strength, contributes to the observed differences between these two channels. These findings expand both our understanding of contemporary weak tie theory and our knowledge of how to disseminate novel information in social networks.</description>

      <title>Firms' Risk Adjustments to Minimum Wage: Financial Leverage and Labor Share Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of the German minimum wage policy on firms' financial leverage. By using a comprehensive firm-establishment-employee linked dataset and a difference-in-differences estimation with firm-level variation in treatment intensity, the analysis shows that the average minimum wage level reduces firms' financial leverage by about 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points, corresponding to 1 to 2 percent of the mean of financial leverage. Further investigation of the mechanism shows that the minimum wage does not lead to significant capital-labor substitution; therefore, the labor share increases. Firms react to the increased labor share by deleveraging. The results suggest that while the minimum wage benefits workers by allocating more earnings to the labor force, it also introduces greater operating risks and encourages conservative financial behavior among firms.</description>

      <title>New fairness criteria for truncated ballots in multi-winner ranked-choice elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world elections where voters cast preference ballots, voters often provide only a partial ranking of the candidates. Despite this empirical reality, prior social choice literature frequently analyzes fairness criteria under the assumption that all voters provide a complete ranking of the candidates. We introduce new fairness criteria for multiwinner ranked-choice elections concerning truncated ballots. In particular, we define notions of the independence of losing voters blocs and independence of winning voters blocs, which state that the winning committee of an election should not change when we remove partial ballots which rank only losing candidates, and the winning committee should change in reasonable ways when removing ballots which rank only winning candidates. Of the voting methods we analyze, the Chamberlin-Courant rule performs the best with respect to these criteria, the expanding approvals rule performs the worst, and the method of single transferable vote falls in between.</description>

      <title>Agricultural Roots of Social Conflict in Southeast Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether harvest-time transitory shifts in employment and income lead to changes in political violence and social unrest in rice-producing croplands of Southeast Asia. Using monthly data from 2010 to 2023 on over 86,000 incidents covering 376 one-degree cells across eight Southeast Asian countries, we estimate a general increase in political violence and a decrease in social unrest in croplands with rice production during the harvest season relative to the rest of the crop year. In a finding that is least sensitive to alternative model specifications and data subsetting, we estimate a nine percent increase in violence against civilians in locations with considerable rice production compared to other parts of the region during the harvest season, relative to the rest of the year. We show that the harvest-time changes in conflict are most evident in rural cells with rainfed agriculture. Using location-specific annual variation in growing season rainfall, we then show that the harvest-time increase in violence against civilians occurs in presumably good harvest years, whereas increase in battles between actors of political violence follows growing seasons with scarce rainfall. The harvest-time decrease in social unrest, protests in particular, occurs after presumably bad harvest years. These findings contribute to research on the agroclimatic and economic roots of conflict and offer insights to policymakers by suggesting the spatiotemporal concentration of conflict as well as diverging effects by forms of conflict at harvest time in the rice-producing regions of Southeast Asia.</description>

      <title>Do Productivity Shocks Cause Inputs Misallocation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08760v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firms exhibit varying productivity levels even within narrowly defined industries and face uncertainty when predicting future performance. This paper investigates the link between productivity uncertainty, heterogeneity, and misallocation across all inputs. Using a model where heterogeneous firms face staggered productivity shocks, creating gaps between expected and actual productivity, I find a positive association between marginal revenue product dispersions and productivity variability. The analysis reveals that productivity shocks predominantly drive marginal revenue product dispersions. By comparing baseline estimates with those from the factor shares approach, I highlight the limitations of the latter method in analyzing the effects of productivity evolution.</description>

      <title>Sources of capital growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03403v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from national accounts show no effect of change in net saving or consumption, in ratio to market-value capital, on change in growth rate of market-value capital (capital acceleration). Thus it appears that capital growth and acceleration arrive without help from net saving or consumption restraint. We explore ways in which this is possible, and discuss implications for economic teaching and public policy</description>

      <title>Networks And Productivity -- A Study In Economic Scholars During COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, offering a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and collaboration dynamics on research productivity. Using a novel network dataset, this paper investigates the role of peer effects on the productivity of economists, as measured by their publication count, during both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that peer effects were significant in the pre-pandemic period but not during the pandemic. Additionally, the study sheds light on gender and race differences. These findings enhance our understanding of how research collaboration impacts knowledge production and provide insights that may inform policies aimed at promoting collaboration and boosting research productivity within the academic community.</description>
