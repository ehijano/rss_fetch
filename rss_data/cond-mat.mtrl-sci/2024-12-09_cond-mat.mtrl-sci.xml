      <title>Spin Chern number in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the topological properties of altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials. We employ equivariant K-theory of magnetic groups and Hamiltonian models to formulate a robust $C^z_4 \mathbb{T}$ topological invariant to classify 2D and 3D altermagnetic systems. Our findings demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological index, corresponding to the half-quantized Chern number of the divided Brillouin zone. This indicator enables the prediction of a topologically protected 2D altermagnetic insulators and 3D Weyl altermagnetic semimetals, highlighting the relationship between altermagnetism and topological phases. Furthermore, our results provide a pathway to the exploration of topological applications in $d$-wave altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Surface molecular engineering to enable processing of sulfide solid electrolytes in humid ambient air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfide solid state electrolytes are promising candidates to realize all solid state batteries due to their superior ionic conductivity and excellent ductility. However, their hypersensitivity to moisture requires processing environments that are not compatible with todays lithium ion battery manufacturing infrastructure. Herein, we present a reversible surface modification strategy that enables the processability of sulfide SSEs under humid ambient air. We demonstrate that a long chain alkyl thiol, undecanethiol, is chemically compatible with the electrolyte with negligible impact on its ion conductivity. Importantly, the thiol modification extends the amount of time that the sulfide SSE can be exposed to air with 33 percent relative humidity with limited degradation of its structure while retaining a conductivity of above 1 mS per cm for up to 2 days, a more than 100 fold improvement in protection time over competing approaches. Experimental and computational results reveal that the thiol group anchors to the SSE surface, while the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail provides protection by repelling water. The modified Li6PS5Cl SSE maintains its function after exposure to ambient humidity when implemented in a Li0.5In LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 ASSB. The proposed protection strategy based on surface molecular interactions represents a major step forward towards cost competitive and energy efficient sulfide SSE manufacturing for ASSB applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice Lingo: Effect of Textual Detail on Multimodal Learning for Property Prediction of Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most prediction models for crystal properties employ a unimodal perspective, with graph-based representations, overlooking important non-local information that affects crystal properties. Some recent studies explore the impact of integrating graph and textual information on crystal property predictions to provide the model with this "missing" information by concatenation of embeddings. However, such studies do not evaluate which type of textual information is actually beneficial. We concatenate graph representations with text representations derived from textual descriptions with varying levels of detail. These descriptions, generated using the Robocrystallographer package, encompass global (e.g., space group, crystal type), local (e.g., bond lengths, coordination environment), and semiglobal (e.g., connectivity, arrangements) information about the structures. Our approach investigates how augmenting graph-based information with various levels of textual detail influences the performance for predictions for shear modulus and bulk modulus. We demonstrate that while graph representations can capture local structural information, incorporating semiglobal textual information enhances model performance the most. Global information can support performance further in the presence of semiglobal information. Our findings suggest that the strategic inclusion of textual information can enhance property prediction, thereby advancing the design and discovery of advanced novel materials for battery electrodes, catalysts, etc.</description>

      <title>A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.</description>

      <title>Driving Thermoelectric Optimization in AgSbTe2 via Design of Experiments and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic optimization of thermoelectric materials is arduous due to their conflicting electrical and thermal properties. A strategy based on Design of Experiments and machine learning is developed to optimize the thermoelectric efficiency of AgSb1+xTe2+y, an established thermoelectric. From eight experiments, high thermoelectric performance in AgSb1.021Te2.04 is revealed with a peak and average thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.61 +/- 0.24 at 600 K and 1.18 +/- 0.18 (300 - 623 K), respectively, which is over 30% higher than the best literature values for AgSb1+xTe2+y. Ag-deficiency and suppression of secondary phases in AgSb1.021Te2.04 improves the electrical properties and reduces the thermal conductivity (~0.4 W m-1 K-1). Our strategy is implemented into an open-source graphical user interface, and it can be used to optimize the methodologies, properties, and processes across different scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Unveiling hole-facilitated amorphisation in pressure-induced phase transformation of silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-induced phase transformation occurs during silicon (Si) wafering processes. \b{eta}-tin (Si-II) phase is formed at high pressures, followed by the transformation to Si-XII, Si-III or/and amorphous Si ({\alpha}-Si) phases during the subsequent decompression. While the imposed pressure and its release rate are known to dictate the phase transformation of Si, the effect of charge carriers are ignored. Here, we experimentally unveil that the increased hole concentration facilitates the amorphization in the pressure-induced phase transformation of Si. The underlying mechanism is elucidated by the theoretical calculations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials. The hole-facilitated amorphization is also experimentally confirmed to occur in the indented Ge, GaAs or SiC. We discover that hole concentration is another determining factor for the pressure-induced phase transformations of the industrially important semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond two-pulse laser approach for spall failure in thin foils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spall failure in materials occurs when tensile waves, propagating through a material, interact leading to failure once the generated hydrostatic stress exceeds the material's strength. In this study, we introduce a novel two-pulse laser approach to induce spall failure by simultaneously illuminating both free surfaces of micro- and nanoscale-thick Ni foils using femtosecond laser pulses.By comparing this method with the conventional single-pulse approach, we demonstrate the unique effects of introducing a secondary laser pulse. Experimental observations utilizing electron microscopy and focused ion beam milling reveal that the proposed approach effectively induces failure at the center of the sample, resulting from the interaction of unloading tensile waves in the bulk. Notably, the spall threshold for nanoscale Ni foils is significantly reduced in the two-pulse approach compared to the single-pulse method. While the single-pulse method requires a threshold fluence of 2,500 $\mathrm{J \cdot m^{-2}}$, the two-pulse approach lowers this to 1,750 $\mathrm{J \cdot m^{-2}}$, highlighting its potential to generate higher hydrostatic stress with less laser pulse energy. Both experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations indicate ductile failure mechanisms involving nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids, preceded by the emission of stacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations. These findings suggest that the two-pulse approach can be an effective approach for high-throughput photomechanical spallation experiments in metals.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of rhenium under high temperatures and pressures predicted by ensemble theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature and high-pressure equations of states (EOSs) of rhenium up to 3000 K and 900 GPa are predicted by a recently developed method in the framework of statistical ensemble theory with \textit{ab initio} computational precision. The predicted isothermal EOSs are generally consistent with semi-empirical calculations below 150 GPa and 3000 K. Especially, the predicted isobaric EOS at one atmosphere is in good agreement with previous experiments. Moreover, the bulk modulus obtained in this work is closer to the experimental measurements than other theoretical works. Based on our calculations, the disputes between previous experiments are analyzed, and it is expected that the EOSs predicted under extreme conditions might be verified in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Origin of Increased Curie Temperature in Lithium-Substituted Ferroelectric Niobate Perovskite: Enhancement of the Soft Polar Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of ferroelectrics is often constrained by their Curie temperature, above which depolarization occurs. Lithium (Li) is the only experimentally known substitute that can increase the Curie temperature in ferroelectric niobate-based perovskites, yet the mechanism remains unresolved. Here, the unique phenomenon in Li-substituted KNbO3 is investigated using first-principles density functional theory. Theoretical calculations show that Li substitution at the A-site of perovskite introduces compressive chemical pressure, reducing Nb-O hybridization and associated ferroelectric instability. However, the large off-center displacement of the Li cation compensates for this reduction and further enhances the soft polar mode, thereby raising the Curie temperature. In addition, the stability of the tetragonal phase over the orthorhombic phase is predicted upon Li substitution, which reasonably explains the experimental observation of a decreased orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature. Finally, a metastable anti-phase polar state in which the Li cation displaces oppositely to the Nb cation is revealed, which could also contribute to the variation of phase transition temperatures. These findings provide critical insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms governing Curie temperature enhancement in ferroelectrics and pave the way for designing advanced ferroelectric materials with improved thermal stability and functional performance.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability and Topological Charge Fragmentation in Antiskyrmions of Rhombohedral Barium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiskyrmions, as topological quasi-particles, hold significant promise for spintronics and nanoscale data storage applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the thermal stability of antiskyrmion nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate. At 1 K, antiskyrmions with a topological charge of -2 emerge as the most stable nanodomain state across all examined diameters. In our systematic study, the most robust antiskyrmion was found to have a diameter of 4 nm, maintaining its original size, shape, and topological charge up to the characteristic temperature T* ~ 85 K. Domains with diameters between 2.8 and approximately 4.5 nm exhibit fragmentation into six topological defects, termed quarks, each carrying a fractional skyrmion charge of -1/3. For domains larger than 4.5 nm, each topological quark splits into two pre-quarks, each with a charge of -1/6. These larger nanodomains demonstrate increased mobility and a growing tendency for shape and skyrmion charge fluctuations. Above the T* temperature, all larger nanodomains gradually shrink to a diameter of about 4 nm before collapsing into a single-domain state. These findings reveal the relatively high stability of antiskyrmions over a broad temperature range, even in the absence of a stabilizing bias field, and emphasize the pivotal role of topological quark dynamics. This establishes barium titanate as a key platform for exploring and applying topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Orbital torque switching of room temperature two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently manipulating the magnetization of van der Waals ferromagnets has attracted considerable interest in developing room-temperature two-dimensional material-based memory and logic devices. Here, taking advantage of the unique properties of the van der Waals ferromagnet as well as promising characteristics of the orbital Hall effect, we demonstrate the room-temperature magnetization switching of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 through the orbital torque generated by the orbital Hall material, Titanium (Ti). The switching current density is estimated to be around 1.6 x 10^6 A/cm^2, comparable to that achieved in Fe3GaTe2 using spin-orbit torque from spin Hall materials. The efficient magnetization switching arises from the combined effects of the large orbital Hall conductivity of Ti and the strong spin-orbit correlation of the Fe3GaTe2, as confirmed through theoretical calculations. Our findings advance the understanding of orbital torque switching and pave the way for exploring material-based orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Near- and mid-infrared excitation of ultrafast demagnetization in a cobalt multilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, ultrafast demagnetization elicited by ultrashort laser pulses has been the subject of a large body of work that aims to better understand and control this phenomenon. Although specific magnetic materials' properties play a key role in defining ultrafast demagnetization dynamics, features of the driving laser pulse such as its duration and photon energy might also contribute. Here, we report ultrafast demagnetization of a cobalt/platinum multilayer in a broad spectral range spanning from the near-infrared (near-IR) to the mid-infrared (mid-IR), with wavelengths between 0.8 and 8.7 $\mu$m. The ultrafast dynamics of the macroscopic magnetization is tracked via the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. We show that the ultrafast demagnetization of the sample can be efficiently induced over that entire excitation spectrum with minimal dependence on the excitation wavelength. Instead, we confirm that the temporal profile of the pump excitation pulse is an important factor influencing ultrafast demagnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Curie temperature in substitutionally disordered alloys using a first-principles based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Br\"{a}nnvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Rashba effects at the Ni/HfO$_2$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the giant ferroelectric control of interfacial properties of Ni/HfO2, namely, (i) the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and (ii) the inverse spin and orbital Rashba effects. The reversible control of magnetic properties using electric gating is a promising route to low-energy consumption magnetic devices, including memories and logic gates. Synthetic multiferroics, composed of a ferroelectric in proximity to a magnet, stand out as a promising platform for such devices. Using a combination of $ab$ $initio$ simulations and transport calculations, we demonstrate that reversing the electric polarization modulates the interface magnetocrystalline anisotropy from in-plane to out-of-plane. This modulation compares favorably with recent reports obtained upon electromigration induced by ionic gating. In addition, we find that the current-driven spin and orbital densities at the interface can be modulated by about 50% and 30%, respectively. This giant modulation of the spin-charge and orbit-charge conversion efficiencies opens appealing avenues for voltage-controlled spin- and orbitronics devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted control of magnonic and electronic band splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically the ability to control non-relativistic magnonic and electronic spin splitting by manipulating phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a representative material, exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting in its electronic bands, we identify an equivalent $d$-wave splitting in magnon modes of specific handedness. Our study reveals a direct correlation between magnonic and electronic splittings, showing that the energy splitting in both magnon and electronic bands can be tuned by jointly modulating the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes with frequencies of 8.52 and 9.74 THz, respectively. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spin-split antiferromagnets, offering new pathways for phonon-driven control in magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-temperature ferromagnetism in ultrathin insulating films with ripple-infinite-layer structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetism and electrical insulation are often at odds, signifying an inherent trade off. The simultaneous optimization of both in one material, essential for advancing spintronics and topological electronics, necessitates the individual manipulation over various degrees of freedom of strongly correlated electrons. Here, by selective control of the spin exchange and Coulomb interactions, we report the achievement of SrFeO2 thin films with resistivity above 106 Ohm.cm and strong magnetization with Curie temperature extrapolated to be 1200 K. Robust ferromagnetism is obtained down to 1.0 nm thickness on substrate and 2.0 nm for freestanding films. Featuring an out of plane oriented ripple infinite layer structure, this ferromagnetic insulating phase is obtained through extensive reduction of as grown brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 films at high compressive strains. Pronounced spin Hall magnetoresistance signals up to 0.0026 is further demonstrated with a Pt Hall bar device. Our findings promise emerging spintronic and topological electronic functionalities harnessing spin dynamics with minimized power dissipations.</description>

      <title>Angstrom Scale Ionic Memristors' Engineering with van der Waals Materials- A Route to Highly Tunable Memory States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors that mimic brain functions are crucial for energy-efficient neuromorphic devices. Ion channels that emulate biological synapses are still in the early stages of development, especially the tunability of memory states. Here, we demonstrate that cations such as K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Al3+ intercalated in the interlayer spaces of vermiculite, result in highly confined channels of size 3-5 {\AA}. They host exotic memristor properties through ion exchange dynamics, even at high salt concentrations of 1 M. The bipolar memristor characteristics observed are tunable with frequency, geometric asymmetry, ion concentration, and intercalants. Notably, we observe polarization-flipping memristor behavior in two cases: one with Al3+ ions and another with devices having a geometric asymmetry ratio greater than 15. This inversion is attributed to the over-screening of counter-ions due to their accumulation at the channel entrance. Our results suggest that ion exchange dynamics, ion-ion interactions, and ion accumulation/depletion mechanisms, particularly with multivalent ions, can be harnessed to develop advanced memristor devices.</description>

      <title>Heat transport in crystalline organic semiconductors: coexistence of phonon propagation and tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding heat transport in organic semiconductors is of fundamental and practical relevance. Therefore, we study the lattice thermal conductivities of a series of (oligo)acenes, where an increasing number of rings per molecule leads to a systematic increase of the crystals' complexity. Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity experiments in these systems disagree with predictions based on the traditional Peierls-Boltzmann framework, which describes heat transport in terms of particle-like phonon propagation. We demonstrate that accounting for additional phonon-tunneling conduction mechanisms through the Wigner Transport Equation resolves this disagreement and quantitatively rationalizes experiments. The pronounced increase of tunneling transport with temperature explains several unusual experimental observations, such as a weak temperature dependence in naphthalene's conductivity and an essentially temperature-invariant conductivity in pentacene. While the anisotropic conductivities within the acene planes are essentially material-independent, the tunneling contributions (and hence the total conductivities) significantly increase with molecular length in the molecular backbone direction, which for pentacene results in a surprising minimum of the thermal conductivity at 300K.</description>

      <title>Analysis of long-lived effects in high-repetition-rate stroboscopic transient X-ray absorption experiments on thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (tr-XAS) has been shown to be a versatile measurement technique for investigating non-equilibrium dynamics. Novel X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities like the European XFEL offer increased repetition rates for stroboscopic XAS experiments through a burst operation mode, which enables measurements with up to 4.5 MHz. These higher repetition rates lead to higher data acquisition rates but can also introduce long-lived excitations that persist and thus build up during each burst. Here, we report on such long-lived effects in Ni and NiO thin film samples that were measured at the European XFEL. We disentangle the long-lived excitations from the initial pump-induced change and perform a detailed modelling-based analysis of how they modify transient X-ray spectra. As a result, we link the long-lived effects in Ni to a local temperature increase, as well as the effects in NiO to excited charge carrier trapping through polaron formation. In addition, we present possible correction methods, as well as discuss ways in which the effects of these long-lived excitations could be minimized for future time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (&lt; 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quasi-Quantum Hall Effect and Coulomb Disorder in Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low carrier densities in topological semimetals (TSMs) enable the exploration of novel magnetotransport in the quantum limit (QL). Reports consistent with 3D quasi-quantum Hall effect (QQHE) have repositioned TSMs as promising platforms for exploring 3D quantum Hall transport, but the lack of tunability in the Fermi has thus far limited the ability to control the QQHE signal. Here, we tune the defect concentrations in the Dirac semimetal Cd${}_3$As${}_2$ to achieve ultra-low carrier concentrations at 2 K around $2.9\times10^{16}$cm${}^{-3}$, giving way to QQHE signal at modest fields under 10 T. At low carrier densities, where QQHE is most accessible, we find that a zero resistivity state is obscured by a carrier density dependent background originating from Coulomb disorder from charged point defects. Our results highlight the interplay between QQHE and Coulomb disorder scattering, demonstrating that clear observation of QQHE in TSMs intricately depends on Fermi level. Predicted in TSMs a decade ago, we find that Coulomb disorder is an essential ingredient for understanding the magnetoresistivity for a spectrum of Fermi levels, experimentally anchoring the important roles of defects and charged disorder in TSM applications. We discuss future constraints and opportunities in exploring 3D QHE in TSMs.</description>

      <title>The emergence of bulk structure in clusters via isotropic multi-well pair potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical, optical, and chemical properties of a wide variety of soft materials are enabled and constrained by their bulk structure. How this structure emerges at small system sizes during self-assembly has been the subject of decades of research, with the aim of designing and controlling material functionality. Despite these efforts, it is still not fundamentally understood how nontrivial interparticle interactions in a finite $N$-body system influence resultant structure, and how that structure depends on $N$. In this study, we investigate the emergence of non-close packings using multi-well isotropic pair potentials to simulate finite cluster formation of four distinct two-dimensional crystal structures. These pair potentials encode multiple preferred length scales into the system, allowing us to understand how anisotropic structural motifs -- as opposed to close-packing -- emerge as cluster size $N$ increases. We find a tendency toward close-packing at small system sizes irrespective of the bulk structure; however, the system size at which bulk structure emerges is influenced by the coordination number of the bulk and the shape of the pair potential. Anisotropic structure emerges through the formation of bonds at a secondary bonding length at larger system sizes, and it is also dependent upon the shape of the pair potential. Our findings demonstrate that tuning particle-particle interactions can enable the engineering of nano- or mesoscale soft matter clusters, in applications as diverse as drug delivery and hierarchical materials design.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups as the K-theory groups associated to magnetic groups and their respective magnetic equivariant complex bundles. We restrict the magnetic group to its subgroup of elements that act complex linearly, and we show that this restriction induces a rational isomorphism with the conjugation invariant part of the complex equivariant K-theory of the restricted group. This isomorphism allows to calculate the torsion free part of the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups reducing it to known calculations in complex equivariant K-theory</description>

      <title>Bias Voltage Driven Tunneling Magnetoresistance Polarity Reversal in 2D Stripy Antiferromagnet CrOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin materials with coupled magnetic and electric polarization are critical for developing energy-efficient and high-density spintronic devices, yet they remain scarce due to often conflicting requirements of stabilizing both magnetic and electric orders. The recent discovery of the magnetoelectric effect in the 2D stripy antiferromagnet CrOCl highlights this semiconductor as a promising platform to explore electric field effects on magnetoresistance. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetoresistance in tunneling junctions of bilayer and monolayer CrOCl. We observe that the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic phases in both cases induces a positive magnetoresistance at low bias voltages, which reverses to a negative value at higher bias voltages. This polarity reversal is attributed to the additional electric dipoles present in the antiferromagnetic state, as supported by our theoretical calculations. These findings suggest a pathway for the electric control of spintronic devices and underscore the potential of 2D magnets like CrOCl in advancing energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Solid-state qubits in moire superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits are the fundamental units in quantum computing, but they are also pivotal for advancements in quantum communication and sensing. Currently, there are a variety of platforms for qubits, including cold atoms, superconducting circuits, point defects, and semiconductor quantum dots. In these systems, each qubit requires individual preparation, making identical replication a challenging task. Constructing and maintaining stable, scalable qubits remains a formidable challenge, especially for solid-state qubits. The race to identify the best one remains inconclusive, making the search for new qubits a welcome endeavor. Our study introduces moir\'e superlattices of twisted bilayer materials as a promising platform for qubits due to their tunability, natural patterns, and extensive materials library. Our first-principles calculations reveal that when the twist angle between the two layers is sufficiently small, these materials foster identical, localized quantum wells within the moir\'e superlattices. Each quantum well accommodates a few dispersionless bands and localized states, akin to the discrete energy levels of an alkali atom. Existing experimental techniques allow for individual initialization, manipulation, and readout of the local quantum states. The vast array of 2D materials provides a multitude of potential candidates for qubit exploration in such systems. Due to their inherent scalability and uniformity, our proposed qubits present significant advantages over conventional solid-state qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

Abstract: This article presents GRFsaw, an open-source software for generating two-phase (binary) microstructures with user-defined structural properties. Unlike most standard software for microstructure generation, GRFsaw is based on the concept of thresholding Gaussian random fields (GRF). It is designed to be used by researchers or engineers in need of a lightweight tool to generate microstructures of various geometries, for example as input to simulations or to other models where such geometries are needed. This could be simulations of fluid flow through porous media, in predictive models of electromagnetic scattering by materials, or in mechanical loading simulations in order to assess, e.g., the material's elasticity or strength.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a non-centrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its non-centrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirms that its structure is non-centrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>The origin of the ferroelectric-like orthorhombic phase in oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we established the relationship between the crystalline structure symmetry, point defects and possible appearance of the ferroelectric-like polarization in HfO2-y nanoparticles. Notably, that XRD and EPR analysis revealed the formation of the ferroelectric-like orthorhombic phase in the oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles (pure and doped with rare-earth element yttrium). DFT calculations showed that small HfO2 nanoparticles may become polar, especially in the presence of impurity atoms and/or oxygen vacancies. To explain the experimental results, we have modified the effective LGD model through the parameterization approach, focusing on the Landau expansion coefficients associated with the polar (FE) and antipolar (AFE) orderings, which agrees with the performed DFT calculations. The effective LGD model can be useful for the development of the novel generation of silicon-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on the HfxZr1-xO2-y.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.</description>

      <title>Instability of the charge density wave in Kagome magnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals show rich competing quantum phases due to geometry frustration, flat bands, many-body effects, and non-trivial topology. Recently, a novel charge density wave (CDW) was discovered deep inside the antiferromagnetic phase of FeGe, attracting intense attention due to close relation with magnetism. Here, via a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we find the 2*2 CDW in FeGe is very fragile and can be readily disrupted into the initial 1*1 phase; Small sqrt3*sqrt3 CDW puddles are found to coexist with the 2*2 CDW in as-grown samples, and can also be induced in the intermediate process of CDW disruption, which will eventually transform into the initial 1*1 phase. Moreover, an exotic intermediate CDW state and standalone CDW nuclei appear unexpectedly during the disruption process. Our first-principle calculations find equal softening of a flat optical phonon mode in a large momentum region around the CDW wave vector, corresponding to numerous competing CDWs with close energies. This might lead to strong instability of the CDW ground state, responsible for STM observations. Our findings provide more novel experimental aspects to understand the CDW in FeGe and suggest FeGe-like Kagome metals are ideal platforms for studying the physics of competing CDW instabilities.</description>

      <title>Tunable ultrastrong magnon magnon coupling and spin Hall magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a remarkable maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.47. Our investigation unveils the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. Additionally, we show the prospect for further enhancement to the deep-strong magnon-magnon coupling regime by manipulating the anisotropy. Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of semiclassical and response theories for second-order nonlinear ac Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that the semiclassical theory and the response theory can equivalently give the Drude and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivities in the linear order of electric field. However, recent theoretical advances implied that the second-order nonlinear conductivities calculated with both approaches are no longer equivalent, which leads to various experimental explanations even in a similar experimental setup conducted in \href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf1506}{[\textit{Science \textbf{381}, 181 (2023)}]} and \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06363-3}{[\textit{Nature \textbf{621}, 487 (2023)}]}, respectively. Herein, by extending the AC semiclassical theory up to the second order of electric field, we show that the semiclassical theory is still equivalent to the response theory in the second order of electric field when the relaxation is taken into account on the same footing. In particular, we show that the familiar second-order nonlinear current responses, including the nonlinear Drude current and the Berry curvature (quantum metric) dipole driven extrinsic (intrinsic) nonlinear Hall current, can be derived by both approaches. Further, we show that the quantum-corrected intrinsic nonlinear longitudinal current, as recently proposed by the response theory or in a similar manner, can also be reproduced by the semiclassical theory. Beyond those known second-order current responses, with both approaches, we uncover two previously overlooked nonlinear displacement currents unique to the AC electric field. As a consequence of this equivalence,...</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin transistors and circuits for conformable electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with low particle mass and weak inter-particle interactions can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons naturally bind to the surfaces of QLS in a vacuum, exhibiting unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. This article reviews the historical development and recent progress in this field. Key topics include collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen; theoretical proposals and experimental efforts toward single-electron qubits on superfluid helium; the recent experimental realization of single-electron charge qubits on solid neon; and related theoretical calculations. Finally, we discuss and envision future exploration of quantum electronics in heterogeneous QLS systems.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>How polarization fields can be beneficial in nitride emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can actually enhance the overlap of electron and hole wave functions in III-nitride quantum wells, which are being considered for polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications. By systematically exploring the design space of AlInGaN heterostructures with machine learning, we uncover that larger electric fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emitters. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to reveal unexpected trends for informing the design of semiconductor heterostructures.</description>
