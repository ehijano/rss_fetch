      <title>Tuneable skyrmion and anti-skyrmion fluids via mechanical strain in chiral kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Visualization of Excitonic Pair Breaking at Individual Impurities in Ta2Pd3Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators host the condensates of bound electron-hole pairs, offering a platform for studying correlated bosonic quantum states. Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ..In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory...</description>

      <title>Imaging Intermediate Melting Phases of Dual Magnetic-Field-Stabilized Wigner Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy in correlated systems can allow electrons to crystallize into Wigner solids. Despite researches across diverse two-dimensional Wigner platforms, the microscopic melting processes through possible intermediate phases remains largely unknown. Here, we present the visualization of electron-lattice melting in monolayer VCl3 on graphite, where two Wigner crystals coexist with markedly different critical temperatures Tc and lattice periods as stabilized by high magnetic field. One Wigner crystal possesses both record-high Tc and electron density, and undergoes melting through an intermediate nematic phase upon decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, the other Wigner crystal with a lower Tc yields a different intermediate phase during melting, exhibiting an anomalous electron liquid with an energy-independent modulation period. First-principles calculations corroborate the band-selective occupations of interface-transferred electrons in the formation of dual Wigner crystals. Our atomically resolved intermediate phases provide crucial insights into the microscopic melting pathways of Wigner crystals, enabling a phase diagram parameterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure and formation mechanism of a newly discovered charge density wave in the m=2 monophosphate tungsten bronze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $m$=2 member of the monophosphate tungsten bronze family has been considered the only one in the family without an electronic instability at low temperature. In this paper, we report the discovery of a charge density wave phase in this compound, with a transition temperature of 290 K and an incommensurate modulation vector \textbf{q}=0.245\textbf{b*}+ $\upxi$\textbf{c*}. The presence of this new phase is confirmed by diffraction and resistivity measurements. Pre-transitional dynamics are investigated using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, revealing a clear Kohn anomaly. We analyze both structural and electronic contributions to the phase transition, providing a comprehensive picture of the mechanism driving this newly identified instability.</description>

      <title>Pseudospin Formulation of Quench Dynamics in the Semiclassical Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pseudospin formulation for the post-quench dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the half-filled spinless Holstein model on a square lattice, assuming spatially homogeneous evolution. This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Electronic Nematicity Revealed by Polarized Ultrafast Spectroscopy in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous Hall Effect in the Eu-Based Compound with a Diamond Network: The Centrosymmetric Cubic Antiferromagnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centrosymmetric cubic compound EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu ions form a diamond network, undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ = 3.3 K and exhibits metamagnetic transitions at H$_{m1}$ = 1.7 T and H$_{m2}$ = 2.8 T for H || [100] at 1.9 K. Between these fields, the magnetization shows a step-like behavior, defining an intermediate field-induced phase (Phase~II). We investigated the electronic transport in Phase~II and found that both the resistivity and Hall resistivity are markedly enhanced, while remaining nearly field independent within the phase. Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence. These features differ from the strongly orientation-selective behavior often observed in skyrmion-lattice phases of several 4f-electron compounds, suggesting that Phase II may host a field-induced spin texture with a topological character distinct from that of a conventional skyrmion lattice.</description>

      <title>Multiple nodal superconducting phases and order-parameter evolution in pressurized UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle \Delta_{z}\rangle/\langle\Delta_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</description>

      <title>Emergent Spin Supersolids in Frustrated Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the emergence of spin supersolids in frustrated quantum magnets, establishing a material-based platform for supersolidity beyond its original context in solid helium. A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic properties in the high-temperature magnetic phase of the skyrmion compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of a GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ single crystal under a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic [001] and [110] directions. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity that is consistent with the complex phase diagram reported previously for this compound. In particular, in our study we focus on the recently identified magnetic phase in the high-temperature region. We show that while this phase is easily destroyed for magnetic fields applied along [001], it is rather stable for fields along [110]. Furthermore, we introduce a Landau theory and a microscopic toy model describing the elastic response at zero field. We reproduce qualitatively the observed anomalies for different acoustic modes, which allows us to propose a magnetic structure for this new high-temperature phase.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of the Fractionalized Dirac Semimetal in the Kitaev-Kondo Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($\Delta{\rho} \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Tunable chiral spiral phases in a non-Hermitian Ising-Gamma spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.</description>

      <title>Family of High-Chern-Number Orbital Magnets in Twisted Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moir\'e unit cell when they are polarized away from the moir\'e interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the St\v{r}eda trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moir\'e systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetries of lattice staggered fermions in 2+1d. Using the symmetries, we can place the system on any sheared torus or Klein bottle. These different backgrounds provide diagnostics of various 't Hooft anomalies associated with the crystalline symmetries. We then compare the lattice model to its continuum limit. The symmetries of the lattice system are mapped in a nontrivial way to the symmetries of the continuum theories. Using this map, we match the 't Hooft anomalies on the lattice and the continuum. Along the way, we develop a general formalism to study Hamiltonian lattice models on nontrivial, compact, flat spaces.</description>

      <title>Bond Additivity and Persistent Geometric Imprints of Entanglement in Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the intricate structure of entanglement in quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge, as standard measures often obscure underlying geometric details. In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\{\omega_j\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $\omega_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic structures encode the underlying symmetries of magnetic materials and play a central role in determining their physical properties. However, reliable magnetic structures are known for only limited compounds. Traditional methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of irreducible representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations are performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 260 materials. Our method correctly identifies the magnetic structure for 207 of these materials, corresponding to an accuracy of 80%. We further apply our highly efficient method to the compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), and establish a database containing 2,800 magnetic materials. As a demonstration of its utility, we apply our magnetic structure database to the systematic identification of 1,070 magnetic topological phases and 389 altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements and band-structure calculations for YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our improved band structure successfully explained the origins of the large dHvA frequencies $\beta$ and $\zeta$, which were inexplicable in previous works. By comparing experimental effective masses with band masses, we determined the electron-phonon coupling for each orbit. The results showed a clear Fermi-surface-sheet dependence of the electron-phonon coupling strength, especially highlighting that the coupling for the band-28 sheet is very weak, almost absent for the orbit with $B \parallel c$. This finding is consistent with previous observations of dHvA oscillations from this orbit in the mixed state down to very low fields. Amidst growing interest in high-temperature superconductivity driven by electron-phonon coupling in hydrides under high pressure, this study provides foundational data pivotal to precisely understanding electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of the Maximal R\'{e}nyi Divergence for a Matrix Product State via Generalized Eigenvalue Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(\rho_{A}\right)+S\left(\rho_{B}\right)-S\left(\rho_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on R\'{e}nyi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal R\'{e}nyi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal R\'enyi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the low-energy electronic structure of the triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ through quasiparticle interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification, control and theoretical modelling of spin-triplet superconductors (STC) remain a central theme in quantum materials research. Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing magnetic fluctuations is one of the keys to understanding the origin of superconductivity in the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ which exhibits two superconducting (SC) phases (SC1 and SC2) under pressure: SC1 where a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with pressure while $T_{\rm c}$ of SC2 rises with pressure. Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>

Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</description>

Abstract: CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $\lambda_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. Finding direct evidence for Kitaev interaction and determining its value has been an essential but formidable challenge in Kitaev physics. Here we report the direct Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. $K$ and $\Gamma$ exhibit dominant dependencies on $\lambda_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides a foundation for designing 2D magnetic materials exhibiting novel behaviors by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</description>

Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response for realistic Kitaev materials under strong magnetic fields and described by the generalized Kitaev $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on using more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe experimental observations well, and hence should be the candidate state realized in the Kitaev material, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show that the polar-angle dependence of the fermionic gap can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiments.</description>

      <title>Large magnetostriction and first-order phase transition induced by ultrahigh magnetic fields in V$_6$O$_{13}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V$_6$O$_{13}$ exhibits the metal-insulator transition (MIT) at around 150 K with the formation of vanadium-vanadium (V-V) dimers. We measured the magnetostriction of V$_6$O$_{13}$ along the crystallographic $b$-axis in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 186 T at various temperatures. An abrupt and large negative magnetostriction of $\Delta L / L \sim 10^{-3}$ was observed above 120 T below 150 K which is attributed to the collapse of the V-V dimer. A pronounced hysteresis exceeding 50 T was observed, indicating a first-order phase transition. The field-induced collapse of the V-V dimer is expected to be accompanied by the insulator-to-metal transition. The robustness of the insulating phase against magnetic fields was discussed based on thermodynamics and the comparison with the case of VO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants to the correlated regime. We construct the interacting Hofstadter model defined on square lattice with the rotation and translation symmetry defects: disclination and dislocation. The model realizes Chern insulator and the charge density wave state as one tunes interactions. Employing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we calculate the excess charge around the defects and find that the topological invariants remain quantized in both phases, with the topological quantity extracted to great precision. This study paves the way for utilizing matrix product state, and potentially other quantum many-body computation methods, to efficiently study crystalline symmetry defects on 2D interacting lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its central role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd R\'enyi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the R\'enyi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for Matrix-Product Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</description>
