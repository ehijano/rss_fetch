      <title>Interpolation and Prewar-Postwar Output Volatility and Shock-Persistence Debate: A Closer Look and New Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the US prewar output was more volatile and less shock persistent than the postwar output. This is often attributed to the data interpolation employed to construct the prewar series. Our analytical results, however, indicate that commonly used linear interpolation has the opposite effect on shock persistence and volatility of a series - it increases shock persistence and reduces volatility. The surprising implication of this finding is that the actual differences between the volatility and shock persistence of the prewar and postwar output series are likely greater than the existing literature recognizes, and interpolation has dampened rather than magnified this difference. Consequently, the view that postwar output was more stable than prewar output because of the effectiveness of the postwar stabilization policies and institutional changes has considerable merit. Our results hold for parsimonious stationary and nonstationary time series commonly used to model macroeconomic time series</description>

      <title>Ecosystem service demand relationship and trade-off patterns in urban parks across China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban parks play a vital role in delivering various essential ecosystem services that significantly contribute to the well-being of urban populations. However, there is quite a limited understanding of how people value these ecosystem services differently. Here, we investigated the relationships among nine ecosystem service demands in urban parks across China using a large-scale survey with 20,075 responses and a point-allotment experiment. We found particularly high preferences for air purification and recreation services at the expense of other services among urban residents in China. These preferences were further reflected in three distinct demand bundles: air purification-dominated, recreation-dominated, and balanced demands. Each bundle delineated a typical group of people with different representative characteristics. Socio-economic and environmental factors, such as environmental interest and vegetation coverage, were found to significantly influence the trade-off intensity among service demands. These results underscore the necessity for tailored urban park designs that address diverse service demands with the aim of enhancing the quality of urban life in China and beyond sustainably.</description>

      <title>Labor Supply under Temporary Wage Increases: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a pre-registered randomized controlled trial to test for income targeting in labor supply decisions among sellers of a Swedish street paper. These workers face liquidity constraints, high income volatility, and discretion over hours. Treated individuals received a 25 percent bonus per copy sold for the duration of an issue, simulating an increase in earnings potential. Treated sellers sold more papers, worked longer hours, and took fewer days off. These findings contrast with studies on intertemporal labor supply that find small substitution effects. Notably, when we apply strategies similar to observational studies, we recover patterns consistent with income targeting.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Misallocation under Price Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Price controls kill the incentive for arbitrage. We prove a Chaos Theorem: under a binding price ceiling, suppliers are indifferent across destinations, so arbitrarily small cost differences can determine the entire allocation. The economy tips to corner outcomes in which some markets are fully served while others are starved; small parameter changes flip the identity of the corners, generating discontinuous welfare jumps. These corner allocations create a distinct source of cross-market misallocation, separate from the aggregate quantity loss (the Harberger triangle) and from within-market misallocation emphasized in prior work. They also create an identification problem: welfare depends on demand far from the observed equilibrium. We derive sharp bounds on misallocation that require no parametric assumptions. In an efficient allocation, shadow prices are equalized across markets; combined with the adding-up constraint, this collapses the infinite-dimensional welfare problem to a one-dimensional search over a common shadow price, with extremal losses achieved by piecewise-linear demand schedules. Calibrating the bounds to station-level AAA survey data from the 1973-74 U.S. gasoline crisis, misallocation losses range from roughly 1 to 9 times the Harberger triangle.</description>

      <title>Regularized Ensemble Forecasting for Learning Weights from Historical and Current Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining forecasts from multiple experts often yields more accurate results than relying on a single expert. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularized ensemble method that extends the traditional linear opinion pool by leveraging both current forecasts and historical performances to set the weights. Unlike existing approaches that rely only on either the current forecasts or past accuracy, our method accounts for both sources simultaneously. It learns weights by minimizing the variance of the combined forecast (or its transformed version) while incorporating a regularization term informed by historical performances. We also show that this approach has a Bayesian interpretation. Different distributional assumptions within this Bayesian framework yield different functional forms for the variance component and the regularization term, adapting the method to various scenarios. In empirical studies on Walmart sales and macroeconomic forecasting, our ensemble outperforms leading benchmark models both when experts' full forecasting histories are available and when experts enter and exit over time, resulting in incomplete historical records. Throughout, we provide illustrative examples that show how the optimal weights are determined and, based on the empirical results, we discuss where the framework's strengths lie and when experts' past versus current forecasts are more informative.</description>

      <title>Exact Value Solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide the solution to the equity premium puzzle without using calibrated values. Calibrated values of subjective time discount factor were used in the prior derived models because 4 variables were determined from 3 different equations. Furthermore, calculated values and risk behavior determination of prior models were compatible with empirical literature. 4 unknown variables are now calculated from 4 different equations in the new derived model in this article. Subjective time discount factor and coefficient of relative risk aversion are found 0.9581 and 1.0319, respectively from the system of equations which are compatible with empirical studies. Micro and macro studies about CRRA value affirm each other for the first time in the literature. Furthermore, equity and risk-free asset investors are pinned down to be insufficient risk-loving, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. Hence it can be said that calculated values and risk attitude determination align with empirical literature. This shows that derived model is valid and make CCAPM work under the same assumptions with those of prior derived models.</description>

      <title>Fiscal Dynamics in Japan under Demographic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Japan's population is shrinking, the share of working-age people is falling, and the number of elderly is growing fast. These trends squeeze public finances from both sides--fewer people paying taxes and more people drawing on pensions and healthcare. Policy discussions often focus on one fix at a time, such as raising taxes, reforming pensions, or boosting productivity. However, these levers interact with each other through feedback loops and time delays that are not yet well understood. This study builds and calibrates an integrated system dynamics model that connects demographics, labor supply, economic output, and public finance to explore two questions: (RQ1) What feedback structure links demographic change to fiscal outcomes, and how do different policy levers work through that structure? (RQ2) Which combinations of policies can stabilize key fiscal indicators within a meaningful timeframe? The model, grounded in official statistics, tracks historical trends reasonably well. Policy experiments show that productivity improvements and controlling per-person costs offer the most effective near-term relief, because they act quickly through revenue and spending channels. In contrast, raising fertility actually worsens the fiscal picture in the medium term, since it takes decades for newborns to grow up and join the workforce. A combined scenario pairing moderate productivity gains with moderate cost control nearly eliminates the deficit by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of timing when evaluating demographic policy. Stabilizing finances within a practical timeframe requires levers that improve the budget directly, rather than those that work through slow demographic channels. The model serves as a transparent testing ground for designing time-aware fiscal policy packages in aging, high-debt economies.</description>
