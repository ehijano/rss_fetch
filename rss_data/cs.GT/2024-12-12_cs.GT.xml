      <title>Game-Theoretic Joint Incentive and Cut Layer Selection Mechanism in Split Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To alleviate the training burden in federated learning while enhancing convergence speed, Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising approach by combining the advantages of federated and split learning. However, recent studies have largely overlooked competitive situations. In this framework, the SFL model owner can choose the cut layer to balance the training load between the server and clients, ensuring the necessary level of privacy for the clients. Additionally, the SFL model owner sets incentives to encourage client participation in the SFL process. The optimization strategies employed by the SFL model owner influence clients' decisions regarding the amount of data they contribute, taking into account the shared incentives over clients and anticipated energy consumption during SFL. To address this framework, we model the problem using a hierarchical decision-making approach, formulated as a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among clients and analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium by examining the leader's game. Furthermore, we discuss privacy concerns related to differential privacy and the criteria for selecting the minimum required cut layer. Our findings show that the Stackelberg equilibrium solution maximizes the utility for both the clients and the SFL model owner.</description>

      <title>Approximate Revenue from Finite Range Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an economic environment where a seller wants to sell an indivisible unit of good to a buyer. We show that revenue from any strategy-proof and individually rational mechanism defined on closed intervals of rich single crossing domains considered in \citep{Goswami1}, can be approximated by the revenue from a sequence of strategy-proof and individually rational mechanisms with finite range. Thus while studying optimal mechanisms without loss of generality we can study mechanisms with finite range.</description>

      <title>The Non-Cooperative Rational Synthesis Problem for Subgame Perfect Equilibria and omega-regular Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the rational synthesis problem for multi-player games played on graphs when rational players are following subgame perfect equilibria. In these games, one player, the system, declares his strategy upfront, and the other players, composing the environment, then rationally respond by playing strategies forming a subgame perfect equilibrium. We study the complexity of the rational synthesis problem when the players have {\omega}-regular objectives encoded as parity objectives. Our algorithm is based on an encoding into a three-player game with imperfect information, showing that the problem is in 2ExpTime. When the number of environment players is fixed, the problem is in ExpTime and is NP- and coNP-hard. Moreover, for a fixed number of players and reachability objectives, we get a polynomial algorithm.</description>

      <title>Proportionally Fair Makespan Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fair mechanisms for the classic job scheduling problem on unrelated machines with the objective of minimizing the makespan. This problem is equivalent to minimizing the egalitarian social cost in the fair division of chores. The two prevalent fairness notions in the fair division literature are envy-freeness and proportionality. Prior work has established that no envy-free mechanism can provide better than an $\Omega(\log m/ \log \log m)$-approximation to the optimal makespan, where $m$ is the number of machines, even when payments to the machines are allowed. In strong contrast to this impossibility, our main result demonstrates that there exists a proportional mechanism (with payments) that achieves a $3/2$-approximation to the optimal makespan, and this ratio is tight. To prove this result, we provide a full characterization of allocation functions that can be made proportional with payments. Furthermore, we show that for instances with normalized costs, there exists a proportional mechanism that achieves the optimal makespan. We conclude with important directions for future research concerning other fairness notions, including relaxations of envy-freeness. Notably, we show that the technique leading to the impossibility result for envy-freeness does not extend to its relaxations.</description>

      <title>Competition and Diversity in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the use of generative artificial intelligence reduces the diversity of content produced. In this work, we develop a game-theoretic model to explore the downstream consequences of content homogeneity when producers use generative AI to compete with one another. At equilibrium, players indeed produce content that is less diverse than optimal. However, stronger competition mitigates homogeneity and induces more diverse production. Perhaps more surprisingly, we show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to do so when faced with competition, and vice versa. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for producing answers that are both correct and unique. We discuss how the interplay between competition and homogeneity has implications for the development, evaluation, and use of generative AI.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing and Advertising with Demand Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a novel pricing and advertising framework, where a seller not only sets product price but also designs flexible 'advertising schemes' to influence customers' valuation of the product. We impose no structural restriction on the seller's feasible advertising strategies and allow her to advertise the product by disclosing or concealing any information. Following the literature in information design, this fully flexible advertising can be modeled as the seller being able to choose any information policy that signals the product quality/characteristic to the customers. Customers observe the advertising signal and infer a Bayesian belief over the products. We aim to investigate two questions in this work: (1) What is the value of advertising? To what extent can advertising enhance a seller's revenue? (2) Without any apriori knowledge of the customers' demand function, how can a seller adaptively learn and optimize both pricing and advertising strategies using past purchase responses?
  To study the first question, we introduce and study the value of advertising - a revenue gap between using advertising vs not advertising, and we provide a crisp tight characterization for this notion for a broad family of problems. For the second question, we study the seller's dynamic pricing and advertising problem with demand uncertainty. Our main result for this question is a computationally efficient online algorithm that achieves an optimal $O(T^{2/3}(m\log T)^{1/3})$ regret rate when the valuation function is linear in the product quality. Here $m$ is the cardinality of the discrete product quality domain and $T$ is the time horizon. This result requires some mild regularity assumptions on the valuation function, but no Lipschitz or smoothness assumption on the customers' demand function. We also obtain several improved results for the widely considered special case of additive valuations.</description>

      <title>Unravelling in Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative learning offers a promising avenue for leveraging decentralized data. However, collaboration in groups of strategic learners is not a given. In this work, we consider strategic agents who wish to train a model together but have sampling distributions of different quality. The collaboration is organized by a benevolent aggregator who gathers samples so as to maximize total welfare, but is unaware of data quality. This setting allows us to shed light on the deleterious effect of adverse selection in collaborative learning. More precisely, we demonstrate that when data quality indices are private, the coalition may undergo a phenomenon known as unravelling, wherein it shrinks up to the point that it becomes empty or solely comprised of the worst agent. We show how this issue can be addressed without making use of external transfers, by proposing a novel method inspired by probabilistic verification. This approach makes the grand coalition a Nash equilibrium with high probability despite information asymmetry, thereby breaking unravelling.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. By the pit of losses paradox, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments systematically reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of ``rejecting all proposals without voting'' outperforms majority. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments. Here, the simple social decision rule of ``accepting all proposals without voting'' is superior to majority. We prove that under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and the antisymmetry of the voting body, the second pit of losses is a mirror image of the pit of losses in hostile environments and explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists whose strategy is supporting all proposals that increase their capital and a group (groups) whose members vote to increase the total group capital. According to the main result, the expected capital gain of each agent in the environment whose generator $X$ has mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds by $\mu$ their expected capital gain under generator $-X$. This result extends to location families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. The mentioned result determines the symmetry of the difference between the expected capital gain under the symmetrized majority and that under the ``basic'' social decision rule that rejects/accepts all proposals in unfavorable/favorable environments.</description>

      <title>Optimistic and pessimistic approaches for cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative game theory studies how to allocate the joint value generated by a set of players. These games are typically analyzed using the characteristic function form with transferable utility, which represents the value attainable by each coalition. In the presence of externalities, coalition values can be defined through various approaches, notably by trying to determine the best and worst-case scenarios. Typically, the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives offer valuable insights into strategic interactions. In many applications, these approaches correspond to the coalition either choosing first or choosing after the complement coalition. In a general framework in which the actions of a group affects the set of feasible actions for others, we explore this relationship and show that it always holds in the presence of negative externalities, but only partly with positive externalities. We then show that if choosing first/last corresponds to these extreme values, we also obtain a useful inclusion result: allocations that do not allocate more than the optimistic upper bounds also do not allocate less than the pessimistic lower bounds. Moreover, we show that when externalities are negative, it is always possible to guarantee the non-emptiness of these sets of allocations. Finally, we explore applications to illustrate how our findings provide new results and offer a means to derive results from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Randomized Lower Bounds for Tarski Fixed Points in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Knaster-Tarski theorem, also known as Tarski's theorem, guarantees that every monotone function defined on a complete lattice has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. Specifically, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$.
  A key special case of interest is the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^k$, which is isomorphic to the power set lattice -- the original setting of the Knaster-Tarski theorem. Our lower bound characterizes the randomized and deterministic query complexity of the Tarski search problem on the Boolean hypercube as $\Theta(k)$. More generally, we prove a randomized lower bound of $\Omega\left( k + \frac{k \cdot \log{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$, which is asymptotically tight in high dimensions when $k$ is large relative to $n$.</description>

      <title>Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</description>
