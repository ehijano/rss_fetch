      <title>Graph Neural Network Surrogates for Contacting Deformable Bodies with Necessary and Sufficient Contact Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.</description>

      <title>A multi-strategy improved snake optimizer for three-dimensional UAV path planning and engineering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14043</link>

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion, effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for application.</description>

      <title>A Paradigm Shift to Assembly-like Finite Element Model Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, there is a mismatch between a finite element model of a structure and its real behaviour. In aeronautics, this mismatch must be small because finite element models are a fundamental part of the development of an aircraft and of increasing importance with the trend to more flexible wings in modern designs. Finite element model updating can be computationally expensive for complex structures and surrogate models can be employed to reduce the computational burden. A novel approach for finite element model updating, namely assembly-like, is proposed and validated using real experimental data. The assembly-like model updating framework implies that the model is updated as parts are assembled. Benchmarking against the classical global, or one-shot, approach demonstrates that the proposed method is more computationally efficient since it takes 20% fewer iterations to obtain convergence, also using fewer parameters for the model evaluations. Despite the increase in computational performance, the new approach retains the fidelity of the global approach.</description>

      <title>Quantifying data needs in surrogate modeling for flow fields in two-dimensional stirred tanks with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stirred tanks are vital in chemical and biotechnological processes, particularly as bioreactors. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model the flow in stirred tanks, its high computational cost$-$especially in multi-query scenarios for process design and optimization$-$drives the need for efficient data-driven surrogate models. However, acquiring sufficiently large datasets can be costly. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution to reduce data requirements while maintaining accuracy by embedding underlying physics into neural network (NN) training. This study quantifies the data requirements of vanilla PINNs for developing surrogate models of a flow field in a 2D stirred tank. We compare these requirements with classical supervised neural networks and boundary-informed neural networks (BINNs). Our findings demonstrate that surrogate models can achieve prediction errors around 3% across Reynolds numbers from 50 to 5000 using as few as six datapoints. Moreover, employing an approximation of the velocity profile in place of real data labels leads to prediction errors of around 2.5%. These results indicate that even with limited or approximate datasets, PINNs can be effectively trained to deliver high accuracy comparable to high-fidelity data.</description>
