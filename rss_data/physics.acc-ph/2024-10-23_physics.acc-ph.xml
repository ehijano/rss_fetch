      <title>Design and analysis of a HTS internally cooled cable for the Muon Collider target and capture solenoid magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon Collider is one of the options considered as the next step in High Energy Physics. It bears many challenges, last not least in superconducting magnet technology. The target and capture solenoid is one of them, a channel of approximately 18 m length consisting of co-axial solenoid magnets with a 1.2 m free bore and peak field on axis of 20 T. One of the main concerns come from the nuclear radiation environment that may influence the stable operation of the coil, as well as its material integrity. Energetic photons cause large radiation heat load, of the order of several kW in the cold mass, and deposit a considerable dose, several tens of MGy. Neutrons cause material damage, at the level of 10-3 DPA. These values are at the present limit of superconducting coil technology. We describe here the conceptual design of the target and capture solenoid, focusing on the HTS cable design, which is largely inspired by the VIPER concept developed at MIT. We show how to address margin and protection, cooling and mechanics specific to the HTS cable selected.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of cascaded round-to-flat and flat-to-round beam transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized beams beam with significant canonical angular momentum are critical to electron cooling of hadron beams such as contemplated in next-generation hadron and electron-ion colliders. The transport of magnetized electron beams over long distances in a locally non-axisymmetric external field is challenging. An alternative is to transform the beam into an uncoupled "flat beam", transport the produced "flat" beam over a long distance, and reintroduce the cross-plane coupling to "re-magnetize" the beam. In this paper, we demonstrate via numerical simulation and laboratory experiments such a cascaded-transformation approach.</description>
