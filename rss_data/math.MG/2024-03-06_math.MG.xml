      <title>Weighted floating functions and weighted functional affine surface areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the new concept of weighted floating functions associated with log concave or $s$-concave functions. This leads to new notions of weighted functional affine surface areas. Their relation to more traditional versions of functional affine surface areas as well as to the classical affine surface areas for convex bodies is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square shape computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitely defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>A non-compact convex hull in generalized non-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in metric spaces that satisfy a weak non-positive curvature condition in the sense that they admit a conical geodesic bicombing. We show that the analog of a question of Gromov about compactness properties of convex hulls has a negative answer in this setting. Specifically, we prove that there exists a complete metric space $X$ that admits a conical bicombing $\sigma$ such that $X$ has a finite subset whose closed $\sigma$-convex hull is not compact.</description>

      <title>On Freedman's link packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Freedman [arXiv:2301.00295] introduced the idea of packing a maximal number of links into a bounded region subject to geometric constraints, and produced upper bounds on the packing number in some cases, while commenting that these bounds seemed far too large. We show that the smallest of these "extravagantly large" bounds is in fact sharp by constructing, for any link, a packing of exponentially many copies as a function of the available volume. We also produce improved and generalized upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles have the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$ defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$ is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$ and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>
