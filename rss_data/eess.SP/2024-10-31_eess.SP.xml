      <title>Solve Mismatch Problem in Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel algorithm for solving mismatch problem in compressed sensing. Its core is to transform mismatch problem into matched by constructing a new measurement matrix to match measurement value under unknown measurement matrix. Therefore, we propose mismatch equation and establish two types of algorithm based on it, which are matched solution of unknown measurement matrix and calibration of unknown measurement matrix. Experiments have shown that when under low gaussian noise levels, the constructed measurement matrix can transform the mismatch problem into matched and recover original images.

      <title>AI-assisted Agile Propagation Modeling for Real-time Digital Twin Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling in real-time faces remarkable challenge due to the complexities of traditional methods such as ray tracing and field measurements. AI-based techniques have emerged to address these limitations, offering rapid, precise predictions of channel properties through ground truth data. This paper introduces an innovative approach to real-time, high-fidelity propagation modeling through advanced deep learning. Our model integrates 3D geographical data and rough propagation estimates to generate precise path gain predictions. By positioning the transmitter centrally, we simplify the model and enhance its computational efficiency, making it amenable to larger scenarios. Our approach achieves a normalized Root Mean Squared Error of less than 0.035 dB over a 37,210 square meter area, processing in just 46 ms on a GPU and 183 ms on a CPU. This performance significantly surpasses traditional high-fidelity ray tracing methods, which require approximately three orders of magnitude more time. Additionally, the model's adaptability to real-world data highlights its potential to revolutionize wireless network design and optimization, through enabling real-time creation of adaptive digital twins of real-world wireless scenarios in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Integrated Sensing and Communications in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) allows networks to perform sensing alongside data transmission. While most ISAC studies focus on single-target, multi-user scenarios, multi-target sensing is scarcely researched. This letter examines the monostatic sensing performance of a multi-target massive MIMO system, aiming to minimize the sum of Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target direction-of-arrival estimates while meeting user equipment (UE) rate requirements. We propose several precoding schemes, comparing sensing performance and complexity, and find that sensing-focused precoding with power allocation for communication achieves near-optimal performance with 20 times less complexity than joint precoding. Additionally, time-sharing between communication and sensing outperforms simple time division, highlighting the benefits of resource-sharing for ISAC.</description>

      <title>Channel-Coded Precoding for Multi-User MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precoding is a critical and long-standing technique in multi-user communication systems. However, the majority of existing precoding methods do not consider channel coding in their designs. In this paper, we consider the precoding problem in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, incorporating channel coding into the design. By leveraging the error-correcting capability of channel codes we increase the degrees of freedom in the transmit signal design, thereby enhancing the overall system performance. We first propose a novel data-dependent precoding framework for coded MISO systems, referred to as channel-coded precoding (CCP), which maximizes the probability that information bits can be correctly recovered by the channel decoder. This proposed CCP framework allows the transmit signals to produce data symbol errors at the users' receivers, as long as the overall information BER performance can be improved. We develop the CCP framework for both one-bit and multi-bit error-correcting capacity and devise a projected gradient-based approach to solve the design problem. We also develop a robust CCP framework for the case where knowledge of perfect channel state information (CSI) is unavailable at the transmitter, taking into account the effect of both noise and channel estimation errors. Finally, we conduct numerous simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CCP and its superiority compared to existing precoding methods, and we identify situations where the proposed CCP yields the most significant gains.</description>

      <title>SleepNetZero: Zero-Burden Zero-Shot Reliable Sleep Staging With Neural Networks Based on Ballistocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep monitoring plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, with sleep staging serving as an essential metric in the monitoring process. Traditional methods, utilizing medical sensors like EEG and ECG, can be effective but often present challenges such as unnatural user experience, complex deployment, and high costs. Ballistocardiography~(BCG), a type of piezoelectric sensor signal, offers a non-invasive, user-friendly, and easily deployable alternative for long-term home monitoring. However, reliable BCG-based sleep staging is challenging due to the limited sleep monitoring data available for BCG. A restricted training dataset prevents the model from generalization across populations. Additionally, transferring to BCG faces difficulty ensuring model robustness when migrating from other data sources. To address these issues, we introduce SleepNetZero, a zero-shot learning based approach for sleep staging. To tackle the generalization challenge, we propose a series of BCG feature extraction methods that align BCG components with corresponding respiratory, cardiac, and movement channels in PSG. This allows models to be trained on large-scale PSG datasets that are diverse in population. For the migration challenge, we employ data augmentation techniques, significantly enhancing generalizability. We conducted extensive training and testing on large datasets~(12393 records from 9637 different subjects), achieving an accuracy of 0.803 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.718. ZeroSleepNet was also deployed in real prototype~(monitoring pads) and tested in actual hospital settings~(265 users), demonstrating an accuracy of 0.697 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.589. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first known reliable BCG-based sleep staging effort and marks a significant step towards in-home health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Property Estimation in Geotechnical Databases Using Labeled Random Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sufficiency of accurate data is a core element in data-centric geotechnics. However, geotechnical datasets are essentially uncertain, whereupon engineers have difficulty with obtaining precise information for making decisions. This challenge is more apparent when the performance of data-driven technologies solely relies on imperfect databases or even when it is sometimes difficult to investigate sites physically. This paper introduces geotechnical property estimation from noisy and incomplete data within the labeled random finite set (LRFS) framework. We leverage the ability of the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter, a fundamental solution for multi-object estimation, to deal with measurement uncertainties from a Bayesian perspective. In particular, this work focuses on the similarity between LRFSs and big indirect data (BID) in geotechnics as those characteristics resemble each other, which enables GLMB filtering to be exploited potentially for data-centric geotechnical engineering. Experiments for numerical study are conducted to evaluate the proposed method using a public clay database.</description>

      <title>Subset Random Sampling of Finite Time-vertex Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying data with irregular structures can be described by finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS), which represent potential temporal and spatial relationships among multiple sources. While sampling and corresponding reconstruction of FTVGS with known spectral support are well investigated, methods for the case of unknown spectral support remain underdeveloped. Existing random sampling schemes may acquire samples from any vertex at any time, which is uncommon in practical applications where sampling typically involves only a subset of vertices and time instants. In sight of this requirement, this paper proposes a subset random sampling scheme for FTVGS. We first randomly select some rows and columns of the FTVGS to form a submatrix, and then randomly sample within the submatrix. Theoretically, we prove sufficient conditions to ensure that the original FTVGS is reconstructed with high probability. Also, we validate the feasibility of reconstructing the original FTVGS by experiments.</description>

      <title>Unauthorized UAV Countermeasure for Low-Altitude Economy: Joint Communications and Jamming based on MIMO Cellular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure the thriving development of low-altitude economy, countering unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential task. The existing widely deployed base stations hold great potential for joint communication and jamming. In light of this, this paper investigates the joint design of beamforming to simultaneously support communication with legitimate users and countermeasure against unauthorized UAVs based on dual-functional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems. We first formulate a joint communication and jamming (JCJ) problem, relaxing it through semi-definite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a tractable semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, with SDR providing an essential step toward simplifying the complex JCJ design. Although the solution to the relaxed SDP problem cannot directly solve the original problem, it offers valuable insights for further refinement. Therefore, we design a novel constraint specifically tailored to the structure of the SDP problem, ensuring that the solution adheres to the rank-1 constraint of the original problem. Finally, we validate effectiveness of the proposed JCJ scheme through extensive simulations. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this paper: https://github.com/LiZhuoRan0. The results confirm that the proposed JCJ scheme can operate effectively when the total number of legitimate users and unauthorized UAVs exceeds the number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Unfolding Target Detection with State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target detection is a fundamental task in radar sensing, serving as the precursor to any further processing for various applications. Numerous detection algorithms have been proposed. Classical methods based on signal processing, e.g., the most widely used CFAR, are challenging to tune and sensitive to environmental conditions. Deep learning-based methods can be more accurate and robust, yet usually lack interpretability and physical relevance. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that combines signal processing and deep learning by unfolding the CFAR detector with a state space model architecture. By reserving the CFAR pipeline yet turning its sophisticated configurations into trainable parameters, our method achieves high detection performance without manual parameter tuning, while preserving model interpretability. We implement a lightweight model of only 260K parameters and conduct real-world experiments for human target detection using FMCW radars. The results highlight the remarkable performance of the proposed method, outperforming CFAR and its variants by 10X in detection rate and false alarm rate.

      <title>RIS-Aided Dual-Polarized MIMO: How Large a Surface is Needed to Beat Single Polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-polarized (DP) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been widely adopted in commercial mobile wireless communications. Such systems achieve multiplexing and diversity gain by exploiting the polarization dimension. However, existing studies have shown that the capacity of DP MIMO may not surpass that of single-polarized (SP) MIMO systems due to the cross-polarization coupling induced by the propagation environment. In this letter, we employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to address this issue and investigate how large the surface should be to ensure a better performance for DP MIMO. Specifically, we first derive the capacities of DP and SP MIMO systems with an RIS, and then study the influence of the RIS size on the system capacity. Our analyses reveal how to deploy the RIS in a DP MIMO scenario.</description>

      <title>Location and Map-Assisted Wideband Phase and Time Calibration Between Distributed Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks utilize a large number of distributed access points (APs) to serve multiple user equipments (UEs), offering significant potential for both communication and localization. However, these networks require frequent phase and time calibration between distributed antennas due to oscillator phase drifts, crucial for reciprocity-based coherent beamforming and accurate localization. While this calibration is typically performed through bi-directional measurements between antennas, it can be simplified to unidirectional measurement under perfect knowledge of antenna locations. This paper extends a recent phase calibration narrowband line-of-sight (LoS) model to a phase and time calibration wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing model, including both LoS and reflection paths and allowing for joint phase and time calibrations. We explore different scenarios, considering whether or not prior knowledge of antenna locations and the map is available. For each case, we introduce a practical maximum likelihood estimator and conduct Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analyses to benchmark performance. Simulations validate our estimators against the CRLB in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chernoff fusion of Bernoulli Gaussian max filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical dependencies between information sources are rarely known, yet in practical distributed tracking schemes, they must be taken into account in order to prevent track divergences. Chernoff fusion is well-known and universally accepted method that can address the problem of track fusion when the statistical dependence between the fusing sources is unknown. In this paper we derive the exact Chernoff fusion equations for Bernoulli Gaussian max filters. These filters have been recently derived in the framework of possibility theory, as the analog of the Bernoulli Gaussian sum filters. The main motivation for the possibilistic approach is that it effectively deals with imprecise mathematical models (e.g. dynamics, measurements) used in tracking algorithms. The paper also demonstrates the proposed possibilistic fusion scheme in the absence of knowledge about statistical dependence.</description>

      <title>Fast Hyperspectral Neutron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral neutron computed tomography is a tomographic imaging technique in which thousands of wavelength-specific neutron radiographs are typically measured for each tomographic view. In conventional hyperspectral reconstruction, data from each neutron wavelength bin is reconstructed separately, which is extremely time-consuming. These reconstructions often suffer from poor quality due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Consequently, material decomposition based on these reconstructions tends to lead to both inaccurate estimates of the material spectra and inaccurate volumetric material separation.
  In this paper, we present two novel algorithms for processing hyperspectral neutron data: fast hyperspectral reconstruction and fast material decomposition. Both algorithms rely on a subspace decomposition procedure that transforms hyperspectral views into low-dimensional projection views within an intermediate subspace, where tomographic reconstruction is performed. The use of subspace decomposition dramatically reduces reconstruction time while reducing both noise and reconstruction artifacts. We apply our algorithms to both simulated and measured neutron data and demonstrate that they reduce computation and improve the quality of the results relative to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multimodal Fusion of In-process Sensor Data for Advanced Manufacturing Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of manufacturing processes is crucial for maintaining product quality and operational efficiency. Modern manufacturing environments generate vast amounts of multimodal data, including visual imagery from various perspectives and resolutions, hyperspectral data, and machine health monitoring information such as actuator positions, accelerometer readings, and temperature measurements. However, interpreting this complex, high-dimensional data presents significant challenges, particularly when labeled datasets are unavailable. This paper presents a novel approach to multimodal sensor data fusion in manufacturing processes, inspired by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. We leverage contrastive learning techniques to correlate different data modalities without the need for labeled data, developing encoders for five distinct modalities: visual imagery, audio signals, laser position (x and y coordinates), and laser power measurements. By compressing these high-dimensional datasets into low-dimensional representational spaces, our approach facilitates downstream tasks such as process control, anomaly detection, and quality assurance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments, demonstrating its potential to enhance process monitoring capabilities in advanced manufacturing systems. This research contributes to smart manufacturing by providing a flexible, scalable framework for multimodal data fusion that can adapt to diverse manufacturing environments and sensor configurations.</description>

      <title>Error correction in interference-limited wireless systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to error correction decoding in the presence of additive alpha-stable noise, which serves as a model of interference-limited wireless systems. In the absence of modifications to decoding algorithms, treating alpha-stable distributions as Gaussian results in significant performance loss. Building on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND), we consider two approaches. The first accounts for alpha-stable noise in the evaluation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) that serve as input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). The second builds on an ORBGRAND variant that was originally designed to account for jamming that treats outlying LLRs as erasures. This results in a hybrid error and erasure correcting decoder that corrects errors via ORBGRAND and corrects erasures via Gaussian elimination. The block error rate (BLER) performance of both approaches are similar. Both outperform decoding assuming that the LLRs originated from Gaussian noise by 2 to 3 dB for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes.</description>

      <title>Surface data imputation with stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious measurements in surface data are common in technical surfaces. Excluding or ignoring these spurious points may lead to incorrect surface characterization if these points inherit features of the surface. Therefore, data imputation must be applied to ensure that the estimated data points at spurious measurements do not strongly deviate from the true surface and its characteristics. Traditional surface data imputation methods rely on simple assumptions and ignore existing knowledge of the surface, yielding in suboptimal estimates. In this paper, we propose using stochastic processes for data imputation. This approach, which originates from surface simulation, allows for the straightforward integration of a priori knowledge. We employ Gaussian processes for surface data imputation with artificially generated missing features. Both the surfaces and the missing features are generated artificially. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method fills the missing values and interpolates data points with better alignment to the measured surface compared to traditional approaches, particularly when surface features are missing.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-level Geometry Reconstruction and Material Identification in 300 GHz Monostatic Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is envisioned to achieve high communication performance alongside advanced sensing abilities. For various applications of ISAC, accurate environment reconstruction including geometry reconstruction and material identification is critical. This paper presents a highly precise geometry reconstruction algorithm and material identification scheme for a monostatic sensing case in a typical indoor scenario. Experiments are conducted in the frequency range from 290 GHz to 310 GHz using a vector network analyzer (VNA)-based channel sounder by co-locating the transmitter and receiver. A joint delay and angle space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based algorithm is implemented to estimate multipath component (MPC) parameters and the indoor geometry is reconstructed based on the extracted parameters. Furthermore, a geometry-based method is employed to model and remove the spurious path of the corner, reaching an accuracy of 1.75 cm. Additionally, a material database using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is established, capturing reflection losses of over 200 common material samples. Applying this database to our monostatic sensing, the measured reflection losses of wall and window frame are accurately identified as cement and steel, respectively. Our results demonstrate the centimeter-level geometry reconstruction and accurate material identification for practical THz ISAC scenarios, which unleash unprecedented sensing potential compared to microwave and millimeter-wave bands.</description>

      <title>KALAM: toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing systeMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse computing paradigms have emerged to meet the growing needs for intelligent energy-efficient systems. The Margin Propagation (MP) framework, being one such initiative in the analog computing domain, stands out due to its scalability across biasing conditions, temperatures, and diminishing process technology nodes. However, the lack of digital-like automation tools for designing analog systems (including that of MP analog) hinders their adoption for designing large systems. The inherent scalability and modularity of MP systems present a unique opportunity in this regard. This paper introduces KALAM (toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing systeMs), which leverages factor graphs as the foundational paradigm for synthesizing MP-based analog computing systems. Factor graphs are the basis of various signal processing tasks and, when coupled with MP, can be used to design scalable and energy-efficient analog signal processors. Using Python scripting language, the KALAM automation flow translates an input factor graph to its equivalent SPICE-compatible circuit netlist that can be used to validate the intended functionality. KALAM also allows the integration of design optimization strategies such as precision tuning, variable elimination, and mathematical simplification. We demonstrate KALAM's versatility for tasks such as Bayesian inference, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoding, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Simulation results of the netlists align closely with software implementations, affirming the efficacy of our proposed automation tool.</description>

      <title>ISAC Prototype System for Multi-Domain Cooperative Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are poised to transform into integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, unlocking groundbreaking services such as digital twinning. To harness the full potential of ISAC networks, it is essential to experimentally validate their sensing capabilities and the role of sensing in boosting communication. However, current prototype systems fall short in supporting multiple sensing functions or validating sensing-assisted communication. In response, we have developed an advanced ISAC prototype system that incorporates monostatic, bistatic, and network sensing modes. This system supports multimodal data collection and synchronization, ensuring comprehensive experimental validation. On the communication front, it excels in sensing-aided beam tracking and real-time high-definition video transmission. For sensing applications, it provides precise angle and range measurements, real-time angle-range imaging, and radio-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our prototype aligns with the 5G New Radio standard, offering scalability for up to 16 user equipments (UEs) in uplink transmission and 10 UEs in downlink transmission. Real-world tests showcase the system's superior accuracy, with root mean square errors of 2.3 degrees for angle estimation and 0.3 meters (m) for range estimation. Additionally, the estimation errors for multimodal-aided real-time radio SLAM localization and mapping are 0.25 m and 0.8 m, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Threshold-based Two-layer Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has heightened the vulnerability to cyber threats, making it imperative to develop Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) capable of adapting to emerging or novel attacks. Prior research has predominantly concentrated on offline unsupervised learning techniques to protect ADSs, which are impractical for real-world applications. Furthermore, these studies often rely heavily on the assumption of known legitimate behaviors and fall short of meeting the interpretability requirements in security contexts, thereby hindering their practical adoption. In response, this paper introduces Adaptive NAD, a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing and interpreting online unsupervised anomaly detection within security domains. We propose an interpretable two-layer anomaly detection approach that generates dependable, high-confidence pseudo-labels. Subsequently, we incorporate an online learning mechanism that updates Adaptive NAD using an innovative threshold adjustment method to accommodate new threats. Experimental findings reveal that Adaptive NAD surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by achieving improvements of over 5.4% and 23.0% in SPAUC on the CIC-Darknet2020 and CIC-DoHBrw-2020 datasets, respectively. The code for Adaptive NAD is publicly available at https://github.com/MyLearnCodeSpace/Adaptive-NAD.</description>

      <title>Sensing-assisted Robust SWIPT for Mobile Energy Harvesting Receivers in Networked ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been proposed to offer communication services and transfer power to the energy harvesting receiver (EHR) concurrently. However, existing works mainly focused on static EHRs, without considering the location uncertainty caused by the movement of EHRs and location estimation errors. To tackle this issue, this paper considers the sensing-assisted SWIPT design in a networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in the presence of location uncertainty. A two-phase robust design is proposed to reduce the location uncertainty and improve the power transfer efficiency. In particular, each time frame is divided into two phases, i.e., sensing and WPT phases, via time-splitting. The sensing phase performs collaborative sensing to localize the EHR, whose results are then utilized in the WPT phase for efficient WPT. To minimize the power consumption with given communication and power transfer requirements, a two-layer optimization framework is proposed to jointly optimize the time-splitting ratio, coordinated beamforming policy, and sensing node selection. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrate the existence of an optimal time-splitting ratio for given location uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Secure Full-Duplex Multi-User Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate physical layer security (PLS) for full-duplex (FD) multi-user systems. We consider a base station (BS) that operates in FD mode and transmits artificial noise (AN) to simultaneously protect uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions. Conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) at the FD BS struggle to fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve signal reception and suppress interference. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel FD BS architecture equipped with multiple transmit and receive movable antennas (MAs). The MAs introduce the DoFs in antenna position optimization, which can improve the performance of secure communication systems. To serve users and counter the cooperative interception of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum of secrecy rates (SSR) maximization problem to jointly optimize the MA positions, the transmit, receive, and AN beamformers at the BS, and the UL powers. We propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems, to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem with highly coupled variables. Specifically, we propose the multi-velocity particle swarm optimization (MVPSO), which is an improved version of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), to simultaneously optimize all MA positions. The transmit/AN beamformers and the UL powers are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). The optimal receive beamformer is derived as a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the advantages of MAs over conventional FPAs in enhancing the security of FD multi-user systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Systems with Full-Rank Matrices Using Sparse or Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a signal $\boldsymbol x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from a quadratic system $\{y_i=\boldsymbol x^\top\boldsymbol A_i\boldsymbol x,\ i=1,\ldots,m\}$ with full-rank matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$ frequently arises in applications such as unassigned distance geometry and sub-wavelength imaging. With i.i.d. standard Gaussian matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$, this paper addresses the high-dimensional case where $m\ll n$ by incorporating prior knowledge of $\boldsymbol x$. First, we consider a $k$-sparse $\boldsymbol x$ and introduce the thresholded Wirtinger flow (TWF) algorithm that does not require the sparsity level $k$. TWF comprises two steps: the spectral initialization that identifies a point sufficiently close to $\boldsymbol x$ (up to a sign flip) when $m=O(k^2\log n)$, and the thresholded gradient descent which, when provided a good initialization, produces a sequence linearly converging to $\boldsymbol x$ with $m=O(k\log n)$ measurements. Second, we explore the generative prior, assuming that $x$ lies in the range of an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with $k$-dimensional inputs in an $\ell_2$-ball of radius $r$. With an estimate correlated with the signal, we develop the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that also comprises two steps: the projected power method that provides an initial vector with $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{k \log L}{m}}\big)$ $\ell_2$-error given $m=O(k\log(Lnr))$ measurements, and the projected gradient descent that refines the $\ell_2$-error to $O(\delta)$ at a geometric rate when $m=O(k\log\frac{Lrn}{\delta^2})$. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that: (i) our approach for the sparse case notably outperforms the existing provable algorithm sparse power factorization; (ii) leveraging the generative prior allows for precise image recovery in the MNIST dataset from a small number of quadratic measurements.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a more effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on large heterophilic datasets.</description>

      <title>SpGesture: Source-Free Domain-adaptive sEMG-based Gesture Recognition with Jaccard Attentive Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/guoweiyu/SpGesture/.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Autoencoder Encodings for ECG Representation in Downstream Prediction Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for cardiovascular assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a 60,000-size vector) make it challenging to use in deep learning models, especially when only small datasets are available. This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants: Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed beta-VAE (Abeta-VAE), and cyclical beta-VAE (Cbeta-VAE), and compare their effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream prediction tasks. The Abeta-VAE achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) to 15.7 plus-minus 3.2 microvolts, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE encodings, when combined with ECG summary features, improved the prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.901. This performance nearly matches the 0.910 AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN models but requires significantly less data and computational resources. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to unknown low dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>
