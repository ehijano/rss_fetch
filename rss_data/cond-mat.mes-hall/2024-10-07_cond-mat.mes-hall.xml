      <title>Hanle effect in current induced spin orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical spin orientation is the generation of electron spin proportional to the electric current. This phenomenon is allowed by symmetry in gyrotropic systems, e.g. in inversion-asymmetric structures with Rashba spin-orbit splitting. Here we develop a theory of electrical spin orientation for magnetic two-dimensional heterostructures. Spin-orbit coupled graphene and semiconductor heterostructures proximitized by ferromagnets are considered. The analytical theory is based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation for a spin-dependent distribution function and collision integral. We show that the induced spin demonstrates the Hanle effect: a direction of the spin depends on the out-of-plane magnetization. Importantly, the Hanle effect is extremely sensitive to the details of electron elastic scattering. In semiconductor heterostructures, the effect of magnetization is present for scattering by long-range disorder and absent for short-range scattering. In spin-orbit-coupled graphene, the Hanle effect occurs at any scattering potential, but the direction of the spin strongly changes with variation of the disorder type. The theory also describes the effect of valley-Zeeman splitting on the electrical spin orientation in graphene, where the spin experiences opposite Hanle effects in two valleys.</description>

      <title>Resolving Polarization Switching Pathways of Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer 3R-MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the pathways of polarization switching in 2D sliding ferroelectrics with multiple internal interfaces is crucial for understanding the switching mechanism and for enhancing their performance in memory-related applications. However, distinguishing the rich configurations of various stacking from a coexistence of polarization domains has remained challenging. In this investigation, we employ optical techniques to resolve the stacking degeneracy in a trilayer 3R-MoS2 across several polarization switching cycles. Through a comprehensive analysis of the unique excitonic response exhibited by different layers, we unveil multiple polarization switching pathways that are determined by the sequential release of domain walls initially pinned at various interfaces within the trilayer, providing an understanding of the switching mechanism in multilayered sliding ferroelectrics. Our study not only reveals the intricate dynamics of polarization switching, but also underscores the crucial role of controlling domain walls, pinning centers, and doping levels, offering new insights for enhancing the applications of these materials in sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Global and Local Topological Crystalline Markers for Rotation-Symmetric Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline symmetry can be used to predict bulk and surface properties of topological phases. For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Resolving and routing the magnetic polymorphs in 2D layered antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphism, commonly denoting the variety of molecular or crystal structures, is a vital element in many natural science disciplines. In van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism is allowed by having multiple layer-selective magnetic structures with the same total magnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magnetic polymorphs remain a great challenge. Here we use the phase-resolved magnetic second-harmonic generation microscopy to elucidate such magnetic polymorphism in the 2D semiconducting layered antiferromagnet chromium sulfur bromide (CrSBr), and demonstrate how the magnetic polymorphs can be deterministically switched in an unprecedented layer-selective manner. With the nonlinear magneto-optical technique unveiling the magnetic symmetry information through the amplitude and phase of light, we could unambiguously resolve the polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayers. Remarkably, the deterministic routing of polymorphic transitions originates from the breaking of energy degeneracy via a magnetic layer-sharing effect: the spin-flip transitions in a tetralayer are governed by the laterally extended bilayer, which acts as a control bit. We envision such controllable magnetic polymorphism to be ubiquitous for van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, and could lead to conceptually new design and construction of spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computation and neuromorphic engineering.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously formed phonon frequency combs in van der Waals solid CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge,Si)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying inhomogeneous magnetic fields at the micron scale using Graphene Hall-Effect sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a graphene Hall-Effect sensor to the inhomogeneous magnetic field generated by a dipole located above it, is investigated numerically at room temperature as a function of the dipole position, its orientation and the conduction regime of the sensor, i.e., diffusive or ballistic. By means of dedicated models, we highlight that the correction factor {\alpha} frequently used to relate the Hall voltage to the magnetic field averaged over the sensor area can be greatly improved in the high proximity situation enabled by the use of graphene, particularly in the ballistic regime. In addition, it is demonstrated that by fine-tuning the dipole position in the sensor plane, the Hall response becomes highly selective with respect to the dipole orientation. These analyses show that diffusive graphene Hall sensors may be preferred for particle detection, while ballistic ones used as close as possible to a nanomagnet would be preferred for magnetometry. With the support of micromagnetic simulations, the principle of the magnetic hysteresis loop measurement of an isolated nanomagnet is quantitively demonstrated with large signal-to-noise ratio to probe incoherent magnetization reversal. Devices based on specially designed graphene Hall crosses operating in the ballistic regime promise to outperform state-of-the-art ballistic Hall sensors based on semiconductor quantum wells especially for nano-magnetometry.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity spin readout via the double latching mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective measurement of single electron spins, or spin readout, is among the most fundamental technologies for spin-based quantum information processing. Implementing spin readout with both high-fidelity and scalability is indispensable for developing fault-tolerant quantum computers in large-scale spin-qubit arrays. To achieve high fidelity, a latching mechanism is useful. However, the fidelity can be decreased by spin relaxation and charge state leakage, and the scalability is currently challenging. Here, we propose and demonstrate a double-latching high-fidelity spin readout scheme, which suppresses errors via an additional latching process. We experimentally show that the double-latching mechanism provides significantly higher fidelity than the conventional latching mechanism and estimate a potential spin readout fidelity of 99.94% using highly spin-dependent tunnel rates. Due to isolation from error-inducing processes, the double-latching mechanism combined with scalable charge readout is expected to be useful for large-scale spin-qubit arrays while maintaining high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Reducing disorder in Ge quantum wells by using thick SiGe barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the disorder properties of two-dimensional hole gases in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers, using thick SiGe barriers to mitigate the influence of the semiconductor-dielectric interface. Across several heterostructure field effect transistors we measure an average maximum mobility of $(4.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ at a saturation density of $(1.72 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, corresponding to a long mean free path of $(30 \pm 1)~\mathrm{\mu m}$. The highest measured mobility is $4.68 \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$. We identify uniform background impurities and interface roughness as the dominant scattering mechanisms limiting mobility in a representative device, and we evaluate a percolation-induced critical density of $(4.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{9} ~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. This low-disorder heterostructure, according to simulations, may support the electrostatic confinement of holes in gate-defined quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Accurate 3D Nanoscale Electromechanical Imaging with a Metrological Atomic Force Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an interferometric piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) method for quantifying the full, three-dimensional response of piezoelectric material without requiring sample rotation. We show that this approach yields quantitative 3D measurement independent of the sample orientation beneath the tip. This approach simplifies existing, angle-resolved PFM techniques, since it only requires four measurements (or three with less redundancy and error checking) to map the full three dimensional, time independent strain field. It also does not require rotating the sample with respect to the cantilever. It benefits from the greatly reduced noise floor of our laser doppler vibrometer interferometric displacement sensor (IDS) of 50fm per rootHz or our quadrature phase differential interferometer (QPDI) noise floor of 5fm per rootHz and the intrinsic accuracy of interferometric measurements. One important result is that the in-plane piezo sensitivities were systematically smaller than the vertical by a factor of 2 to 3. A simple analysis of vertical and lateral contact stiffnesses, due to the difference in the Young (vertical) and Shear (lateral) sample moduli predicts a factor of 2.5, in good agreement with the measurements. Finally, we fit observed OBD measurements to a linear combination of interferometrically measured in-plane and vertical responses for four different ferroelectric samples. We found that the in-plane response accounted for 20% or more of the OBD response and surprisingly, in two out of the four samples, the in-plane contribution was in fact 2x larger than the vertical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the possibility of the stable migration of the single vibron excitation in the system consisting of biomolecule and the attached molecular structure. The model is based on the assumption of the vibron self-trapping and the formation of the non-adiabatic polaron quasiparticle. We have shown that, contrary to the prediction of the non-polaron model, the excitation appears on a large intramolecular distance from its origin with a high probability.</description>

      <title>Theory of a two-dimensional anharmonic piezoelectric crystal resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a lattice dynamical theory of an atomically-thin compressional piezoelectric resonator. Acoustic and optical dynamic displacement response functions are derived and account for frequency-dependent electromechanical coupling. The dynamic susceptibilities for the direct and the converse piezoelectric effects are found equal. The mechanical resonant behavior of longitudinal in-plane displacement waves is investigated as a function of the lateral crystal size and of temperature in the classical and in the quantum regime. In the former case the quality factor of the resonator is inversely proportional to temperature and to crystal size. Below a cross-over temperature the quantum zero-point fluctuations become dominant and put an upper limit on the quality factor which is size independent. As experimentally relevant examples, the theory is applied on two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide.</description>

      <title>Tunable diode effect in a superconducting tunnel junction with biharmonic drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Josephson diode is a superconducting circuit element that enables non-reciprocal transport, allowing a dissipationless supercurrent to preferentially flow in a single direction. Existing methods for achieving the required symmetry breaking mostly rely on specifically-designed materials or carefully-engineered circuits composed of multiple Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate that applying a biharmonic drive to a conventional superconducting tunnel-junction induces a diode effect through harmonic mixing processes that shift the supercurrent region. We show that, in a conventional tunnel junction, unity efficiency is achievable while maintaining a large supercurrent. Moreover, the relative phase between the two driving tones determines the directionality of the diode, which can be tuned in situ.</description>

      <title>F\"orster valley-orbit coupling and topological lattice of hybrid moir\'e excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid exciton in moir\'e superlattices of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors inherits the electric dipole, strong moir\'e trapping, and stacking optical selection rules from its interlayer part, whereas the intralayer part is intended for enhancing optical coupling strength. Here, we show that electron-hole Coulomb exchange, or F\"orster coupling, within the intralayer component qualitatively alters the properties of moir\'e excitons, enabling their coherent hopping between moir\'e traps laterally separated over 10 nm and/or across layers, where their kinetic propagation is completely suppressed. Valley-flip hopping channels are found as significant as the valley-conserving ones, leading to rich possibilities to tailor valley-orbit-couplings and introduce non-trivial topology to the moir\'e exciton superlattice. In twisted MoTe$_2$ where hybrid moir\'e excitons feature a symmetry protection from radiative recombination, we show that F\"orster valley-orbit-coupling can give rise to a rich topological phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the chemical potential disorder in the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy under ultra-high vacuum and down to 1.7 K to study the local variations of the chemical potential on the surface of the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films (thickness 7 - 30 nm) with varying Sb-concentration $x$, to gain insight into the charge puddles formed in thin films of a compensated topological insulator. We found that the amplitude of the potential fluctuations, $\Gamma$, is between 5 to 14 meV for quasi-bulk conducting films and about 30 - 40 meV for bulk-insulating films. The length scale of the fluctuations, $\lambda$, was found to span the range of 13 - 54 nm, with no clear correlation with $\Gamma$. Applying a magnetic field normal to the surface, we observe the condensation of the two-dimensional topological surface state into Landau levels and find a weak but positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and the spectral width of the Landau-level peaks, which suggests that quantum smearing from drift motion is the source of the Landau level broadening. Our systematic measurements give useful guidelines for realizing $(\mathrm{Bi}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_x)_2\mathrm{Te}_3$ thin films with an acceptable level of potential fluctuations. In particular, we found that $x\approx 0.65$ realizes the situation where $\Gamma$ shows a comparatively small value of 14 meV and the Dirac point lies within $\sim$10 meV of the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Experimental detection of vortices in magic-angle graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of superconducting magic-angle twisted-layer graphene films elevates this material system to a promising candidate for superconducting electronics. We implement a gate-tuned Josephson junction in a magic-angle twisted four-layer graphene film. Field-dependent measurements of the critical current show a Fraunhofer-like pattern that differs from the standard pattern with characteristics typical for a weak transverse screener. We observe sudden shifts associated with vortices jumping into and out of the leads. By tuning the leads to the edge of the superconducting dome, we observe fast switching between superconducting and normal states, an effect associated with vortex dynamics. Time-dependent measurements provide us with the vortex energy scale and an estimate for the London penetration depth, in agreement with recent kinetic inductance measurements on twisted graphene films. Our results prove the utility of our junction as a sensor for vortex detection, allowing us to extract fundamental properties of the 2D superconductor.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength topological interface modes in a multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic and rigorous analytical approach, based on the transfer matrix methodology, to study the existence, evolution, and robustness of subwavelength topological interface states in practical multilayered vibroacoustic phononic lattices. These lattices, composed of membrane-air cavity unit cells, exhibit complex band structures with various bandgaps, including Bragg, band-splitting induced, local resonance, and plasma bandgaps. Focusing on the challenging low-frequency range and assuming axisymmetric modes, we show that topological interface states are confined to Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps. Unlike the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the vibroacoustic lattice exhibits diverse topological phase transitions across infinite bands, enabling broadband, multi-frequency vibroacoustics in the subwavelength regime. We establish three criteria for the existence of these states: the Zak phase, surface impedance, and a new reflection coefficient concept, all derived from transfer matrix components. Notably, we provide an explicit expression for the exact location of topological interface states within the band structure, offering insight for their predictive implementation. We confirm the robustness of these states against structural variations and identify delocalization as bandgaps narrow. Our work provides a complete and exact analytical characterization of topological interface states, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer matrix method. Beyond its analytical depth, our approach provides a useful framework and design tool for topological phononic lattices, advancing applications such as efficient sound filters, waveguides, noise control, and acoustic sensors in the subwavelength regime. Its versatility extends beyond the vibroacoustic systems, encompassing a broader range of phononic and photonic crystals with repetitive inversion-symmetric unit cells.</description>

      <title>Implementing Josephson Junction spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junction spectroscopy is a powerful local microwave spectroscopy technique that has promising potential as a diagnostic tool to probe the microscopic origins of noise in superconducting qubits. We present advancements toward realizing Josephson junction spectroscopy in a scanning geometry, where the Josephson junction is formed between a superconducting sample and a high capacitance superconducting STM tip. Data from planar Nb-based Josephson junction devices first demonstrate the benefits of including a high capacitance shunt across the junction, which decreases linewidth and improves performance at elevated temperatures. We show how an equivalent circuit can be implemented by utilizing a planarized STM tip with local prominences, which are fabricated via electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching, followed by coating with a superconducting layer. Differential conductance measurements on a superconducting NbN surface demonstrate the ability of these high capacitance tips to decrease both thermal noise and P(E)-broadening in comparison to typical wire tips.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly of a halogenated organic molecule on the Si(111) $\surd$3$\times$$\surd$3-Ag surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of halogen-based organic molecules on a passivated silicon surface. The room temperature adsorption of 2,4,6-tris(4-iodophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TIPT) on the Si(111)-$\surd$3$\times$$\surd$3-Ag surface is described. The adsorption is investigated primarily by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. The experimental results is a dramatic example of how the substrate can influence the overall structure of the self-assembly. With increasing dose, the TIPT monomers form supramolecular structures defined by a two monomer, 2.07 $\pm$ 0.05 nm by 1.83 $\pm$ 0.05 nm rectangular cell. The unit cell is characterized by zig-zag rows of molecules aligned \pm13{\deg} from the high symmetry directions of the $\surd$3-Ag substrate. The 2.07 nm dimension along the zig-zag rows is very similar to self-assembled TIPT networks observed on HOPG, however the 1.83 nm dimension is extended considerably and commensurate with the $\surd$3-Ag substrate. The epitaxial relationship between the overlayer and the substrate, and the commensurate inter-row spacing indicate significant molecule-substrate interactions. In fact, DFT calculations of free standing TIPT hexamers reveal that increasing the inter row spacing comes at little energy cost. Experiments also indicate that the formation of supramolecular TIPT domains is extremely sensitive to the quality of the underlying $\surd3$-Ag reconstruction. Point defects in the $\surd3$-Ag reconstruction ultimately restricts the extent of the observed domains.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear ferrielectricity and hydrogen-induced ferromagnetic polar half-metallicity in MnO$_3$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collinear dipole orders such as ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity have developed rapidly in last decades. While, the noncollinear dipole orders are rarely touched in solids. Noncollinear dipole orders can provide a route to realize ferrielectricity. Based on first-principles calculations, an inorganic molecular crystal MnO$_3$Cl has been demonstrated to own intrinsic noncollinear ferrielectricity, which originates from the stereo orientations of polar molecules. The large negative piezoelectricity effect ($d_{33}\sim-27$ pC/N) is also predicted. A strong light absorption and moderate optical anisotropy are found for this molecular crystal in the ultraviolet light window. Additionally, by electron doping via hydrogen intercalation, a ferromagnetic polar half-metals can be obtained. Our study here provide a material platform to explore the intriguing physics of noncollinear ferrielectricity and potential applications in devices.</description>

      <title>Ge epitaxy at ultra-low growth temperatures enabled by a pristine growth environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium (Ge), the next-in-line group-IV material, bears great potential to add functionality and performance to next-generation nanoelectronics and solid-state quantum transport based on silicon (Si) technology. Here, we investigate the direct epitaxial growth of two-dimensional high-quality crystalline Ge layers on Si deposited at ultra-low growth temperatures ($T_{Ge} = 100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}-350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) and pristine growth pressures ($\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{mbar}$). First, we show that $T_{Ge}$ does not degrade the crystal quality of homoepitaxial Ge/Ge(001) by comparing the point defect density using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Subsequently, we present a systematic investigation of the Ge/Si(001) heteroepitaxy, varying the Ge coverage (${\theta}_{Ge}$, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 nm) and $T_{Ge}$ ($100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, in increments of $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) to assess the influence of these parameters on the layer's structural quality. Atomic force microscopy revealed a rippled surface topography with superimposed grainy features and the absence of three-dimensional structures, such as quantum dots. Transmission electron microscopy unveiled pseudomorphic, grains of highly crystalline growth separated by defective domains. Thanks to nanobeam scanning x-ray diffraction measurements, we were able to evidence the lattice strain fluctuations due to the ripple-like structure of the layers. We conclude that the heteroepitaxial strain contributes to the formation of the ripples, which originate from the kinetic limitations of the ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Virial Expansion for the Optical Response of Doped Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe$_2$ [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization senses topological phase transition in spin-orbit coupled $\alpha$-$T_3$ system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-$T_3$ system undergoes a topological phase transition(TPT) between two distinct quantum spin-Hall phases across $\alpha=0.5$ when the spin-orbit interaction of Kane-Mele type is taken into consideration. As a hallmark of such a TPT, we find that the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment change their respective signs across the TPT. We also find the trails of the TPT in another physical observable, namely, the orbital magnetization(OM) that can be, in principle, detected experimentally through the circular dichroism associated with optical absorption. The topological features of the OM are understood in terms of valley and spin physics. The valley-resolved OM(VROM) and the spin-resolved OM(SROM) exhibit interesting characteristics related to the valley and the spin Chern number when the chemical potential is tuned in the forbidden gap(s) of the energy spectrum. In particular, we find that the slope of the VROM versus the chemical potential in the forbidden gap changes its sign abruptly across the TPT, which is also consistent with the corresponding change in the valley Chern number. Moreover, the slope of the SROM demonstrates a sudden jump by one unit of $e/h$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge and $h$ is the Planck's constant) across the TPT, which is also in agreement with the corresponding change in the spin Chern number. It is further seen that a definite spin-valley optical selection rule governs the circular dichroism. The $k$-resolved degree of the optical polarization and the low-frequency differential optical absorbance manifest sign change across the TPT. We discuss experimentally viable signatures of different quantum spin-Hall phases in the optical absorbance.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic coherence in quantum fluids allows the observation of interference effects in their wavefunctions, and enables applications such as superconducting quantum interference devices based on Josephson tunneling. The Josephson effect manifests in both fermionic and bosonic systems, and has been well studied in superfluid helium and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In exciton-polariton condensates - that offer a path to integrated semiconductor platforms - creating weak links in ring geometries has so far remained challenging. In this work, we realize a Josephson junction in a polariton ring condensate. Using optical control of the barrier, we induce net circulation around the ring and demonstrate both superfluid-hydrodynamic and the Josephson regime characterized by a sinusoidal tunneling current. Our theory in terms of the free-energy landscapes explains the appearance of these regimes using experimental values. These results show that weak links in ring condensates can be explored in optical integrated circuits and hold potential for room-temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Strategies for enhancing spin-shuttling fidelities in Si/SiGe quantum wells with random-alloy disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent coupling between distant qubits is needed for any scalable quantum computing scheme. In quantum dot systems, one proposal for long-distance coupling is to coherently transfer electron spins across a chip in a moving potential. Here, we use simulations to study challenges for spin shuttling in Si/SiGe heterostructures caused by the valley degree of freedom. We show that for devices with valley splitting dominated by alloy disorder, one can expect to encounter pockets of low valley splitting, given a long-enough shuttling path. At such locations, inter-valley tunneling leads to dephasing of the spin wavefunction, substantially reducing the shuttling fidelity. We show how to mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude, putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a technique that dramatically reduces the contact resistances and depletes a shunting channel between the contacts outside the Hall bar in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. It involves the creation of three overlapping independent gates deposited on top of the structure and allows transport measurements to be performed at millikelvin temperatures in the strongly interacting limit at low electron densities, where the energy of the electron-electron interactions dominates all other energy scales. This design allows one to observe the two-threshold voltage-current characteristics that are a signature for the collective depinning and sliding of the electron solid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the influence of electron-magnon scattering processes on the ultrafast demagnetization in itinerant ferromagnets. In the framework of a ferromagnetic model system, we compute the spin-dependent dynamics of electrons in itinerant Bloch states including electron-magnon and electron-electron scattering. Our approach includes both electron-magnon and electron-electron scattering processes on an equal footing. While the former process flips the electronic spin accompanied by the creation or destruction of a magnons, the latter exchanges electronic angular momentum with the lattice due to the influence of spin-orbit coupling. We show that the interplay of the two different scattering mechanisms leads to the creation of magnons and a transfer of angular momentum to the lattice that, for a realistic choice of the electron-magnon interaction and excitation conditions, is considerably more efficient than spin-orbit assisted electron-electron scattering alone. This process of magnon creation and spin-lattice coupling constitutes an essentially non-equilibrium microscopic scenario for the ultrafast demagnetization process in itinerant ferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced tunable Kondo effect in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single sheets of graphene, vacancy-induced states have been shown to host an effective spin-1/2 hole that can be Kondo-screened at low temperatures. Here, we show how these vacancy-induced impurity states survive in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), which thus provides a tunable system to probe the critical destruction of the Kondo effect in pseudogap hosts. Ab-initio calculations and atomic-scale modeling are used to determine the nature of the vacancy states in the vicinity of the magic angle in TBG, demonstrating that the vacancy can be treated as a quantum impurity. Utilizing this insight, we construct an Anderson impurity model with a TBG host that we solve using the numerical renormalization group combined with the kernel polynomial method. We determine the phase diagram of the model and show how there is a strict dichotomy between vacancies in the AA/BB versus AB/BA tunneling regions. In AB/BA vacancies, the Kondo temperature at the magic angle develops a broad distribution with a tail to vanishing temperatures due to multifractal wavefunctions at the magic angle. We argue that scanning tunneling microscopy in the vicinity of the vacancy can act as a probe of both the critical single-particle states and the underlying many-body ground state in magic-angle TBG.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of quantum teleportation protocols implemented with Silicon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent experimental advancements demonstrating high-fidelity universal logic gates and basic programmability, Silicon-based spin quantum bit (qubit) have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. However, implementation of more complex quantum information protocols with many qubits still remains a critical challenge for realization of practical programmability in Silicon devices. In this study, we present a computational investigation of entanglement-based quantum information applications implemented on an electrically defined quantum dot structure in Silicon. Using in-house multi-scale simulations based on tight-binding calculations augmented with bulk physics, we model a five quantum dot system that can create up to five electron spin qubits, and discuss details of control engineering needed to implement single-qubit rotations and two-qubit logic operations in a programmable manner. Using these elementary operations, then, we design a five-qubit quantum teleportation protocol and computationally verify its end-to-end operation including a simple but clear analysis on how the designed circuit can be affected by charge noise. With engineering details that are not well uncovered by experiments, our results demonstrate the advanced programmability of Silicon quantum dot systems, delivering the practical guidelines for potential designs of quantum information processes based on electrically defined Silicon quantum dot structures.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>

      <title>$\varphi$ Josephson junction induced by altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters, e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the chemical doping of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic response of a ferromagnetic nanofilament under rotating fields: effects of flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using nonequilibrium computer simulations, we study the response of ferromagnetic nanofilaments, consisting of stabilized onedimensional chains of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, under external rotating magnetic fields. In difference with their analogous microscale and stiff counterparts, which have been actively studied in recent years, nonequilibrium properties of rather flexible nanoparticle filaments remain mostly unexplored. By progressively increasing the modeling details, we are able to evidence the qualitative impact of main interactions that can not be neglected at the nanoscale, showing that filament flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions contribute independently to broaden the range of synchronous frequency response in this system. Furthermore, we also show the existence of a limited set of characteristic dynamic filament configurations and discuss in detail the asynchronous response, which at finite temperature becomes probabilistic.</description>

      <title>The chiral torsional anomaly and the Nieh-Yan invariant with and without boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exists a long-standing debate regarding the torsion contribution to the 4d chiral anomaly of a Dirac fermion. Central to this debate is the Nieh-Yan anomaly, which has been considered ill-defined and a regularization artifact. Using a heat-kernel approach, we examine the relationship between the Dirac operator index, the Nieh-Yan invariant and the torsional anomaly. We show the Nieh-Yan invariant vanishes on spacetimes without boundaries, if the Dirac index is well-defined. In the known examples of non-vanishing Nieh--Yan invariant on manifolds without boundaries, the heat kernel expansion breaks down, making the index ill-defined. Finally, for finite boundaries we identify several finite bulk and boundary anomaly terms, alongside bulk and boundary Nieh-Yan terms. We construct explicit counterterms that cancel the Nieh-Yan terms and argue that the boundary terms give rise to a torsional anomalous Hall effect. Our results emphasize the importance of renormalization conditions, as these can affect the non-thermal Nieh-Yan anomaly coefficients. In addition, we demonstrate that anomalous torsional transport may arise even without relying on the Nieh-Yan invariant.</description>
