      <title>Teaching LLMs to Speak Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text processing, yet adapting Transformer-based neural networks to non-textual scientific modalities typically requires specialized architectures and extensive computational resources. We demonstrate that LLaMA-3.1-8B can be efficiently repurposed to predict galaxy redshifts from spectroscopic data through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), achieving competitive performance while preserving its linguistic capabilities. Using only 16 GPU-hours and adapting 0.04% of model parameters, our approach achieves a mean absolute error of 0.04 in redshift prediction while retaining over 85% of performance on AstroBench and 89% on general QA tasks from eval-harness. This minimal-effort adaptation--requiring only simple standard fine-tuning APIs--lowers barriers to entry for domain scientists and enables integrated agentic workflows where a single model handles both spectroscopic data for quantitative analysis and natural language for reasoning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Convolution Direction and Template Selection for Difference Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difference image analysis (DIA) is a powerful tool for studying time-variable phenomena, and has been used by many time-domain surveys. Most DIA algorithms involve matching the spatially-varying PSF shape between science and template images, and then convolving that shape in one image to match the other. The wrong choice of which image to convolve can introduce one of the largest sources of artifacts in the final difference image. We introduce a quantitative metric to determine the optimal convolution direction that depends not only on the sharpness of the images measured by their FWHM, but also on their exposure depths. With this metric, the optimal convolution direction can be determined a priori, depending only on the FWHM and depth of the images. This not only simplifies the process, but also makes it more robust and less prone to creating sub-optimal difference images due to the wrong choice of the convolution direction. As an additional benefit, for a large set of images, we define a Figure-of-Merit based on this metric, which allows us to rank a list of images and determine the ones best suited to be used as templates, thus streamlining and automating the data reduction process.</description>

      <title>In-orbit Spectral Calibration Prospects for the COSI Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager is an upcoming NASA space telescope in the MeV range. COSI's primary science goals include precisely mapping nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI's spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over time will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI's entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every eight hours at the full instrument level and every 24 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI's telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an on-board radioactive calibration source which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Toward High-Precision Astrometry with CSST Using Multi-Gaussian Fitting of PSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) presents significant potential for high-precision astrometry. In this study, we show that the point spread function (PSF) modeled by the discrete PSF with Multi-Gaussian function can effectively enhance the astrometric accuracy. We determine that the PSF profile can be accurately modeled by three Gaussians, which takes advantage of reduced computational complexity in PSF convolution. In sparse star fields, the lowest centering accuracy we obtain after aberration correction can be below 1 mas. We find that the proper motion errors remain below 1.0 mas/yr for point sources with five observations and approximately 0.8 mas/yr for seven observations with a time baseline of around 3.5 years. We finally demonstrate that the precision of our position measurements for stars fainter than 21 mag in the simulated CSST crowded field is better than the results from both SExtractor and DOLPHOT.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Characterisation with the Twinkle Space Telescope Following Advances from JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Twinkle Space Telescope is a satellite designed for spectroscopic observations of a wide range of extrasolar and solar system objects. Equipped with a 0.45 m diameter telescope and a spectrometer covering from 0.5 to 4.5 microns simultaneously, Twinkle will be launched in a sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit, and it is expected to operate for seven years. Twinkle is developed, managed and operated by Blue Skies Space (BSSL), a space science data company whose vision is to accelerate and expand the availability of new, high-quality datasets to researchers worldwide, complementing the space observatories delivered by government space agencies.
  Over its lifetime, Twinkle will conduct large-scale survey programs. The scientific objectives and observational strategy of these surveys are defined by researchers who join the Science Team.
  Leveraging advances made possible by recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, we present here updated simulations evaluating Twinkle's observational capabilities in the context of exoplanet atmospheres. Through retrieval analyses of HD 209458 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 3470 b, and 55 Cnc e, we demonstrate how increasing observational investment enhances the retrieval of atmospheric parameters and molecular abundances. Our sensitivity study highlights Twinkle's capability to detect less abundant or less detectable molecules depending on the observing strategies adopted. This work provides practical guidance for developing targeted observational strategies to maximise Twinkle's scientific return.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.</description>

      <title>PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood. Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152 Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda = 1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle $\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and $\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit, which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Replicating the flyby sampling of salty ocean world ice grains using impact ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.</description>

Abstract: There are new detector proposals and R&amp;D that utilize quantum enhancements not previously adopted. Examples include superconducting quantum sensors, atom interferometry, and quantum spin sensors. They are mainly motivated by industrial applications toward quantum computing, secure quantum communication systems, and high-sensitivity sensors. Given the excellent potential of the new quantum measurement systems, there are also new proposals to apply them in particle physics and cosmology. In this review, I survey currently available and emerging quantum technologies and their applications. I then discuss future directions and new proposals for particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>An automated, self-calibration based pipeline for high-fidelity solar imaging with LOFAR: SIMPL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is capable of imaging spectroscopy of the Sun in the 10-240 MHz frequency range, with high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, the complex and rapidly varying nature of solar radio emission - spanning several orders of magnitude in brightness further exacerbated by the strong ionospheric phase distortions during daytime observations, poses major challenges for calibration, imaging, and automation. We aim to develop a fully automated, high-fidelity imaging pipeline optimized for LOFAR solar observations, capable of handling the intrinsic variability of solar emission and producing science-ready images with minimal human intervention. We have built the Solar Imaging Pipeline for LOFAR (SIMPL), which integrates excision of radio-frequency interference (RFI) for the solar-specific scenarios, calibration strategies, and self-calibration. The pipeline is designed to enable scalable and uniform processing of large archival datasets. SIMPL achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging dynamic range compared to previous efforts and reliably produces high-quality spectroscopic snapshot images. It has been tested across a wide range of solar conditions. It is currently being employed to process a decade of LOFAR solar observations, providing science-ready FITS images for the community and enabling both comprehensive and novel studies of solar radio phenomena -- ranging from quiet Sun emission and faint non-thermal features to active regions and their associated dynamic events, such as transient bursts.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations, coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.</description>

      <title>Application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Removing Telescope Beam Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces {\tt{PI-AstroDeconv}}, a physics-informed semi-supervised learning method specifically designed for removing beam effects in astronomical telescope observation systems. The method utilizes an encoder-decoder network architecture and combines the telescope's point spread function or beam as prior information, while integrating fast Fourier transform accelerated convolution techniques into the deep learning network. This enables effective removal of beam effects from astronomical observation images. {\tt{PI-AstroDeconv}} can handle multiple PSFs or beams, tolerate imprecise measurements to some extent, and significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of image deconvolution. Therefore, this architecture is particularly suitable for astronomical data processing that does not rely on annotated data. To validate the reliability of the architecture, we used the SKA Science Data Challenge 3a datasets and compared it with the $\tt{CLEAN}$ deconvolution method at the 21-cm power spectrum level. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only restores details and reduces blurriness in celestial images at the pixel level but also more accurately recovers the true neutral hydrogen power spectrum at the power spectrum level.</description>

Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Temporal variability in low-frequency radio interference: Insight from high-cadence monitoring at a candidate radio notification zone in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) monitoring is essential in the site selection process before constructing radio astronomy observatories, followed by mitigation strategies to minimize its adverse effects. Malaysia has an enormous prospect for radio astronomy due to its prominent location in the centre of Southeast Asia, but is challenged by its relatively high population density. In this research article, we perform high-cadence, low-frequency RFI monitoring at two sites, each representing an urban and a rural environment. Using modified generalized spectral kurtosis (GSK) as an RFI detection method, we ascertain the suitability of Glami Lemi, a rural area in the centre of Peninsular Malaysia previously assigned as a candidate radio notification zone (RNZ), as a potential site for radio astronomy observations due to its lower RFI contamination in our high-cadence monitoring, especially when compared with urban areas. We identified a number of persistent and transient RFI in our dataset, associate each of them with their potential origins and, if present, characterize their temporal evolution. A few types of RFI mitigation strategies were also tested and discussed. This study lays the groundwork for Malaysia's endeavours in establishing its first research-grade radio telescope, emphasizing the importance of robust RFI detection and mitigation strategies in optimizing observational outcomes.</description>

      <title>Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy: Multi-view Fusion with Attention-based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first successful detection of gravitational waves by ground-based observatories, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), marked a breakthrough in our comprehension of the Universe. However, due to the unprecedented sensitivity required to make such observations, gravitational-wave detectors also capture disruptive noise sources called glitches, which can potentially be confused for or mask gravitational-wave signals. To address this problem, a community-science project, Gravity Spy, incorporates human insight and machine learning to classify glitches in LIGO data. The machine-learning classifier, integrated into the project since 2017, has evolved over time to accommodate increasing numbers of glitch classes. Despite its success, limitations have arisen in the ongoing LIGO fourth observing run (O4) due to the architecture's simplicity, which led to poor generalization and inability to handle multi-time window inputs effectively. We propose an advanced classifier for O4 glitches. Using data from previous observing runs, we evaluate different fusion strategies for multi-time window inputs, using label smoothing to counter noisy labels, and enhancing interpretability through attention module-generated weights. Our new O4 classifier shows improved performance, and will enhance glitch classification, aiding in the ongoing exploration of gravitational-wave phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Heartbeat Stars Recognition Based on Recurrent Neural Networks: Method and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the variety of their light curve morphologies, the vast majority of the known heartbeat stars (HBSs) have been discovered by manual inspection. Machine learning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of variable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the automatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for HBSs. First, the orbital frequencies are calculated automatically according to the Fourier spectra of the light curves. Then, the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are extracted. Finally, these harmonics are normalized as feature vectors of the light curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using ELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for supervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these light curves. The performance of the RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of synthetic light curves, achieving 95$\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs from the OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy of 86$\%$. This method successfully identifies four new HBSs within the eclipsing binary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs proves to be a practical approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognizing this type of time series data. This method not only allows efficient identification of HBSs but can also be extended to recognize other types of periodic variable stars.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the time-domain LISA response model with central finite differences and hybridization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) response is crucial for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis. A key computational challenge lies in evaluating time-delay interferometry (TDI) variables, which require projecting GW polarizations onto the LISA arms at different retarded times. Without approximations, the full LISA response is computationally expensive, and traditional approaches, such as the long-wavelength approximation, accelerate the response calculation at the cost of reducing accuracy at high frequencies. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid time-domain response for LISA that balances computational efficiency and accuracy across the binary's evolution. Our method is applicable to massive black hole binaries and implements a fast low-frequency approximation during the early inspiral$\unicode{x2013}$where most of these binaries spend most of the time in the sensitive frequency band of LISA$\unicode{x2013}$while reserving the computationally intensive full-response calculations for the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases. The low-frequency approximation (LFA) is based on Taylor expanding the response quantities around a chosen evaluation time such that time delays correspond to central finite differences. Our hybrid approach supports CPU and GPU implementations, TDI generations 1.5 and 2.0, and flexible time-delay complexity, and has the potential to accelerate parts of the global fit and reduce energy consumption. We also test our LFA and hybrid responses on eccentric binaries, and we perform parameter estimation for a "golden" binary. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of our low-frequency response for "deep alerts" by performing inspiral-only Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 2032 December 22 the 60 m diameter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4% chance of impacting the Moon. Such an impact would release 6.5 MT TNT equivalent energy and produce a ~1 km diameter crater. We estimate that up to 10^8 kg of lunar material could be liberated in such an impact by exceeding lunar escape speed. Depending on the actual impact location on the Moon as much as 10% of this material may accrete to the Earth on timescales of a few days. The lunar ejecta-associated particle fluence at 0.1 - 10 mm sizes could produce upwards of years to of order a decade of equivalent background meteoroid impact exposure to satellites in near-Earth space late in 2032. Our results demonstrate that planetary defense considerations should be more broadly extended to cis-lunar space and not confined solely to near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>RADAR-Radio Afterglow Detection and AI-driven Response: A Federated Framework for Gravitational Wave Event Follow-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landmark detection of both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 has spurred efforts to streamline the follow-up of GW alerts in current and future observing runs of ground-based GW detectors. Within this context, the radio band of the EM spectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of detecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient angular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW localization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio emission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years, necessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various post-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio observing resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up strategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors promise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a framework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven information sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while integrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data aggregation. We show that it is possible to preserve data rights while sharing models that can help design and/or update follow-up strategies. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of GW170817, and discuss future directions for refinement and broader application.</description>

      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. This is especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey.</description>

      <title>Error dependencies in the space-based CNEOS fireball database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$&lt;0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having $D_D$=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$&lt;0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>
