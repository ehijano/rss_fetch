      <title>Examples of Toric Scalar-flat K\"ahler Surfaces with Mixed-type Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a strictly unbounded toric symplectic 4-manifold, we explicitly construct complete toric scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics on the complement of a toric divisor. These symplectic 4-manifolds correspond to a specific class of non-compact K\"ahler surfaces. We also provide an alternative construction of toric scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics with conical singularity along the toric divisor, following the approach of Abreu and Sena-Dias.</description>

      <title>On contact cosmetic surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the contact cosmetic surgery conjecture holds true for all non-trivial Legendrian knots, with the possible exception of Lagrangian slice knots. We also discuss the contact cosmetic surgeries on Legendrian unknots and make the surprising observation that there are some Legendrian unknots that have a contact surgery with no cosmetic pair, while all other contact surgeries are contactomorphic to infinitely many other contact surgeries on the knot.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and framing of F-bundles and applications to quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F-bundle is a formal/non-archimedean version of variation of nc-Hodge structures which plays a crucial role in the theory of atoms as birational invariants from Gromov-Witten theory. In this paper, we establish the spectral decomposition theorem for F-bundles according to the generalized eigenspaces of the Euler vector field action. The proof relies on solving systems of partial differential equations recursively in terms of power series, and on estimating the size of the coefficients for non-archimedean convergence. The same technique allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of the extension of framing for logarithmic F-bundles. As an application, we prove the uniqueness of the decomposition map for the A-model F-bundle (hence quantum D-module and quantum cohomology) associated to a projective bundle, as well as to a blowup of an algebraic variety. This complements the existence results by Iritani-Koto and Iritani.</description>

      <title>Background Cohomology and Symplectic Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group $G$ on a complete \ka manifold $M$ with a proper moment map. In a previous paper, we defined a regularized version of the Dolbeault cohomology of a $G$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle, called the background cohomology. In this paper, we show that the background cohomology of a prequantum line bundle over $M$ `commutes with reduction', i.e. the invariant part of the background cohomology is isomorphic to the usual Dolbeault cohomology of the symplectic reduction.</description>

      <title>Quantisation via Branes and Minimal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The `brane quantisation' is a quantisation procedure developed by Gukov and Witten \cite{Gukov:2008ve}.
  We implement this idea by combining it with the tilting theory and the minimal resolutions. This way, we can realistically compute the deformation quantisation on the space of observables acting on the Hilbert space. We apply this procedure to certain quantisation problems in the context of generalised K\"ahler structure on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Our approach differs from and complements that of Bischoff and Gualtieri \cite{Bischoff:2021ixy}.
  We also benefitted from an important technical tool: a combinatorial criterion for the Maurer-Cartan equation, developed in \cite{BarmeierWang} by Barmeier and Wang.</description>

      <title>Anosov contact metrics, Dirichlet optimization and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first main result of this paper classifies contact 3-manifolds admitting critical metrics, i.e. adapted metrics which are the critical points (of the Dirichlet energy functional. This gives a complete answer to a question raised by Chern-Hamilton in 1984. Secondly, we show that in the case of Anosov contact metrics, the optimization of such energy functional is closely related to Reeb dynamics and can be described in terms of its entropy. We also study the consequences in the curvature realization problem for such contact metrics.</description>

      <title>Bow varieties as symplectic reductions of $T^*(G/P)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04696v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherkis bow varieties were introduced as ADHM type description of moduli space of instantons on the Taub-NUT space equivariant under a cyclic group action. They are also models of Coulomb branches of quiver gauge theories of affine type A. In this paper, we realize each bow variety with torus fixed points as a symplectic reduction of a cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety by a unipotent group, and find a slice of this action. By this description, we calculate the equivariant cohomology (and ordinary cohomology) of some of them and answer some questions raisedbefore. This also uses a new result about circle-equivariant cohomology proven in an appendix. We also give an explicit generalized Mirkovic-Vybornov isomorphism for bow varieties in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Pl\"ucker Coordinates and the Rosenfeld Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exceptional compact hermitian symmetric space EIII is the quotient $E_6/Spin(10)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_4}U(1)$. We introduce the Pl\"ucker coordinates which give an embedding of EIII into $\mathbb{C}P^{26}$ as a projective subvariety. The subvariety is cut out by 27 Pl\"ucker relations. We show that, using Clifford algebra, one can solve this over-determined system of relations, giving local coordinate charts to the space.
  Our motivation is to understand EIII as the complex projective octonion plane $(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O})P^2$, whose construction is somewhat scattered across the literature. We will see that the EIII has an atlas whose transition functions have clear octonion interpretations, apart from those covering a sub-variety $X_{\infty}$ of dimension 10. This subvariety is itself a hermitian symmetric space known as DIII, with no apparent octonion interpretation. We give detailed analysis of the geometry in the neighbourhood of $X_{\infty}$.
  We further decompose $X={\rm EIII}$ into $F_4$-orbits: $X=Y_0\cup Y_{\infty}$, where $Y_0\sim(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is an open $F_4$-orbit and is the complexification of $\mathbb{O}P^2$, whereas $Y_{\infty}$ has co-dimension 1, thus EIII could be more appropriately denoted as $\overline{(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}}$. This decomposition appears in the classification of equivariant completion of homogeneous algebraic varieties by Ahiezer \cite{Ahiezer}.</description>
