      <title>A clustering-based search for substructures in the Galactic plane and bulge using RR Lyrae stars as tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many globular clusters (GCs) have been identified in the Galaxy, their population is estimated to be incomplete, especially in regions with strong crowding and interstellar extinction such as the Galactic bulge and plane.RR Lyrae stars, as bright standard candles and tracers of old stellar populations, are powerful tools for finding GCs in these regions, and large catalogs of such stars have recently become available. We aim to construct a sample of RR Lyrae stars with six-dimensional information (three-dimensional positions, proper motions, and metallicities) in the Galactic plane and bulge, and to exploit it using a hierarchical clustering algorithm to search for Galactic substructures. We build a sample of fundamental-mode RR Lyrae (RRab) stars with positions, distances, proper motions, and photometric metallicity estimates from Gaia and VVV data. Using a clustering algorithm calibrated to optimize GC recovery, we identify groups of RRab stars with similar locations in the six-dimensional parameter space. The most promising groups are selected by comparison with the properties of known GCs. We recover many RRab groups associated with known Galactic GCs and derive the first RR Lyrae-based distances for BH 140 and NGC 5986. We also detect small groups of two to three RRab stars at distances up to ~25 kpc that are not associated with any known GC, but display GC-like distributions in all six parameters. Several of these groups, mostly pairs, lie toward the Galactic bulge but show distinct proper motions or distances, suggesting they may not belong to the bulge population. Overall, our approach identifies dozens of GC-like RRab groups in the Galactic plane and bulge, which are excellent targets for follow-up observations. Future radial velocity measurements can test whether the RRab members of these groups are truly co-moving.</description>

      <title>The ionization structure and chemical history in isolated H ii regions of dwarf galaxies with VIMOS/IFU II. The Leo A galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime.</description>

      <title>Variation of the 2175 {\AA} extinction feature in Andromeda galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extinction curves contain key information on interstellar dust composition and size distribution, with the 2175 {\AA} bump being the most prominent feature. We analyze 20 sightlines toward M31 using HST/STIS UV spectroscopy combined with multi-band photometry to characterize this feature. The extinction curves show substantial diversity, from MW-like shapes to flatter profiles with $R_V$ reaching up to $\sim5.8$. The strength of the 2175 {\AA} feature varies widely, including two sightlines where the bump is essentially absent. The bump central wavelength spans a broader range than previously reported, while its width remains consistent with earlier studies. A moderate positive correlation is found between bump strength ($c_3$) and width ($\gamma$). We derive an average UV extinction curve toward M31 with $R_V \approx 3.53$. These results provide new constraints on dust properties and their spatial variations in this galaxy.</description>

      <title>photoD with Rubin's Data Preview 1: first stellar photometric distances and deficit of faint blue stars. Stellar distances with Rubin's DP1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We investigate the utility of Rubin's Data Preview 1 for estimating stellar number density profile in the Milky Way halo. Methods: Stellar broad-band near-UV to near-IR $ugrizy$ photometry released in Rubin's Data Preview 1 is used to estimate distance and metallicity for blue main sequence stars brighter than $r=24$ in three $\sim$1.1. sq.~deg. fields at southern Galactic latitudes. Results: Compared to TRILEGAL simulations of the Galaxy's stellar content by (Dal Tio, 2022), we find a significant deficit of blue main sequence turn-off stars with $22 &lt; r &lt; 24$. We interpret this discrepancy as a signature of a much steeper halo number density profile at galactocentric distances $10-50$ kpc than the cannonical $\sim1/r^3$ profile assumed in TRILEGAL simulations. Conclusions: This interpretation is consistent with earlier suggestions based on observations of more luminous, but much less numerous, evolved stellar populations, and a few pencil beam surveys of blue main sequence stars in the northern sky. These results bode well for the future Galactic halo exploration with Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Neural Network for the Recovery of Transfer Functions From Velocity-Resolved Reverberation Mapping Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of active galactic nuclei are that they are highly variable with time. In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to "reverberate" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus.</description>

      <title>The Redshifts from 122 Bands: Comparative Redshift Forecast for Low-Resolution Spectra from SPHEREx and 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently initiated SPHEREx and 7DS surveys will deliver low-resolution spectra ($R\approx 30-130$) for hundreds of millions of galaxies over the optical to near-infrared range ($0.4-5.0\mu m$), covering a wide sky area without sample selection. These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 &lt; i &lt; 18) galaxies, with $\sigma_{NMAD}\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets.</description>

      <title>Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\ast &gt; 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ it is less $0.4$\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\ast &lt; 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\ast \sim 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\ast \sim 8\times 10^5 M_\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Destruction of the interstellar dust by a supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Destruction of the interstellar dust proceeds primary behind supernova shocks. The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\rm log}~M_d \sim {\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \sim \zeta_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium.</description>

      <title>Scalable Stellar Parameter Inference Using Python-based LASP: From CPU Optimization to GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the efficiency, scalability, and cross-survey applicability of stellar parameter inference in large spectroscopic datasets, we present a modular, parallelized Python framework with automated error estimation, built on the LAMOST Atmospheric Parameter Pipeline (LASP) originally implemented in IDL. Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys. The code and DESI-based catalog are available via \dataset[DOI: 10.12149/101679]{https://doi.org/10.12149/101679} and \dataset[DOI: 10.12149/101675]{https://doi.org/10.12149/101675}, respectively.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a galaxy associated with the HI cloud FAST J0139+4328</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for ``dark galaxies,'' a key prediction of the lambda cold dark matter, has yielded few viable candidates. Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Milankovi\'c} and $0.6\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Nedeljkovi\'c} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field. We report the unambiguous discovery of a low-surface-brightness (LSB) optical counterpart at the location of the HI cloud. Furthermore, the detection of H$\alpha$ emission via the $6\,\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\star = (7.2 \pm 3.7) \times 10^6\, M_{\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit. Using the literature HI mass, this implies a gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\mathrm{HI}} / M_{\star} = 11.5 \pm 6.4$. Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. This reclassification resolves the status of this prominent dark galaxy candidate and underscores the necessity of deep optical follow-up to classify faint HI-selected systems.</description>

      <title>Connecting disc-corona physics and ionised outflows in AGN in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM). We focus on the non-linear Lx-Luv relation and on deviations from this canonical coupling encoded in $\Delta \alpha_{OX}$, the offset of the optical-to-X-ray index from the mean relation, and propose to use broad and narrow line emission and CGM nebulae as calorimeters of the ionising SED to trace different accretion "states". We propose an observational strategy based on rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopy of $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ AGN, a time-domain reverberation-mapping tier for a well-defined subsample, coordinated X-ray coverage, and wide-field IFU mapping of CGM emission (including H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$). From these goals we derive requirements for a future ESO facility in the 2040s: a dedicated, wide-field, high-multiplex optical-NIR spectroscopic telescope with time-domain flexibility and arcmin-scale IFU capability.</description>

      <title>From Nbody1 to Nbody7: the Growth of Sverres Industry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.</description>

      <title>A millimeter methanol maser ring tracing the deceleration of the heat wave powered by the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch, multi-band ALMA imaging of the new Class II millimeter methanol masers excited during the accretion outburst of the massive protostar G358.93-0.03 MM1. The highest angular resolution image (24 mas $\approx$ 160 au) reveals a nearly complete, circular ring of strong maser spots in the 217.2992 GHz ($v_t$=1) maser line that closely circumscribes the dust continuum emission from MM1. Weaker maser emission lies inside the eastern and southern halves of the maser ring, generally coincident with the centimeter masers excited during the outburst, but avoiding the densest parts of the hot core gas traced by high excitation lines of CH$_3$CN. Using a variety of fitting techniques on the image cubes of the two strongest maser lines, each observed over 3-4 epochs, we find the diameter of the ring increased by $\gtrsim$60% (from $\approx$1100 to $\approx$1800 au in the 217 GHz line) over 200 days, consistent with an average radial propagation rate of $\approx$0.01c, while the maser intensity declined exponentially. Fitting the angular extent of the millimeter masers versus time yields a power law of index 0.39$\pm$0.06, which also reproduces the observed extent of the 6.7 GHz masers in the first VLBI epoch of R. A. Burns et al. (2020). This exponent is consistent with the prediction of radius vs. time in the Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov self-similar solution for an intense spherical explosion from a point source ($R \propto t^{2/5}$). These results demonstrate the explosive nature of accretion outbursts in massive protostars and their ability to generate subluminal heat waves traceable by centimeter and millimeter masers for several months as the energy traverses the surrounding molecular material.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the young stellar group around Sh 2-295</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation is governed by multiple physical processes, making it inherently complicated. One excellent example is the Canis Major OB1/R1 Association, whose complex history of star formation is related to different episodes. Three supernova (SN) events potentially altered the environment and impacted star formation and stellar evolution. Prior investigations revealed two stellar groups of different ages associated with GU CMa and Z CMa. This work focusses on identifying the low-mass young stellar population near FZ CMa, located between these two groups and spatially related to the H II region Sh 2-295. Our main goal is to verify whether this group is age-mixed and characterise its physical properties. We analysed multi-object spectroscopic data acquired with Gemini/GMOS to search for typical features of T Tauri stars (TTs) and to determine their spectral types. Lithium absorption line ($\lambda$ 6708 $\mathring{A}$) was used as a youth indicator, while H$\alpha$ emission was investigated to probe accretion activity. We also derived ages based on optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and compared the projected spatial distribution to diffuse infrared (IR) emission. We identified 29 TTs, including six new members of the association and three Classical TTs (CTTs). The equivalent width of the Li I absorption line suggests an age of $8.1^{+2.1}_{-3.8}$ Myr, while optical photometric data indicate stellar ages ranging from $\sim$1 to 14 Myr. Younger stars are concentrated around Sh 2-295, whereas the older ones are more widely dispersed. We increased the number of known TTs related to the CMa association. Our results support a scenario of multiple star-formation episodes, including a younger group that may have been triggered by the expansion of Sh 2-295. The influence of SN events appears limited in this context.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lens Masses in Moderately to Highly Magnified Microlensing Events from Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrained the FS effect, and therefore established lower limits for the angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we used the DarkLensCode software to obtain the mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.7$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. A DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of $\sim 0.42-1.70$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 80%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass black holes and contribution to extragalactic background light from Population III stars in Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass range of observed black holes extends from stellar-mass to supermassive scales, yet the existence of objects in the intermediate-mass range of $10^{2} - 10^{5} \text{M}_{\odot}$ remains unconfirmed. Black holes are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a ``spike''. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\sim 130$ unmerged IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The contribution of their progenitors to the extragalactic background light in the near-infrared is less than $10^{-3} \text{nW} \text{m}^{-2} \text{sr}^{-1}$, well below previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A 'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free SMS up to $10^6 \, M_\odot$. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050\,\AA) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. With wind and macroturbulent broadening, we match LRD spectra at $z=7.76$ and $z=3.55$, including the H$\beta$ width of MoM-BH*-1 to within 4\%. We predict a luminosity-dependent observability window, $\sim10^{4}$ yr for the most luminous systems and $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ yr if $L_\lambda(4050\,\text{\AA})$ is lower by 1--2 dex. These results provide a self-consistent alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggest JWST may be witnessing luminous stages of SMBH progenitors before collapse.</description>

      <title>The superclouds of the local Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, providing much needed insight into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local $\sim 5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$ and masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds, primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they act as gas reservoirs for the formation of giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the Radcliffe Wave. We find that while the superclouds have linear masses that vary by about a factor of 4, their volume densities only vary by about 10$\%$. This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. One of those intriguing properties is the absence of radio detections in high redshift LRDs. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs have radio emission that may be produced by accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) or by frequent supernovae (SNe) from a cluster of massive stars. Methods. Assuming LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyse here archive Very Large Array radio observations of J1047+0739 and J1025+1402, two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A (Very Large Array) as a compact source with radius less than 0.2 arcsec ($&lt;$700 pc at d = 750 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $\mu$Jy and its in-band spectral index was -0.85$\pm$0.24, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It was also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 130$\pm$9 $\mu$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by either a radio luminous supernova or an accreting IMBH/SMBH. However, the lack of important variation in flux density over eight years favors the IMBH/SMBH hypothesis. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</description>

      <title>Resolving dust and Ly{\alpha} emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman $\alpha$ emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Ly$\alpha$ escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at $z=6.5676$ to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Ly$\alpha$ escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated ($\sim$kpc), slit-level ($\sim$0.1 kpc), and pixel-level ($\sim$25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing ($\mu \approx 8.3$-$9.1$). A Ly$\alpha$ map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of $\log M_\ast = 8.3$-$8.4$ and an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{\rm UV} = -19.8 \pm 0.1$. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Ly$\alpha$ emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Ly$\alpha$ escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing $A_V$. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Ly$\alpha$ escape.</description>

      <title>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>

      <title>Rotation and stability of the circumnuclear gas disk in the Galactic Center potential by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the gravitational potential and mass distribution in the Galactic Center by examining the morphology and kinematics of the circumnuclear gaseous disk revealed by the molecular line data from the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES). We obtain an estimate of the shape of the potential {within the central $\sim 20$ pc} to reproduce the observed properties of the circumnuclear gas disk (CND) by simulating the motion of test particles for various axial ratios and show that the potential is approximately spherical. We construct a rotation curve by applying the terminal velocity method to the position-velocity diagrams, and calculate the mass distribution in the Galactic Center. The distribution of mass density is found to be of cusp type, approximated by $\rho_{\rm mass} \sim 1.56\times 10^5(R/1 {\rm pc})^{-1.9}~M_{\odot} {\rm pc}^{-3}$, where $R$ is the distance from the nucleus. We discuss the tidal effect caused by the gravitational potential that produces the rotation curve and show that the gas disk is stable against self-gravitational contraction within a critical radius of $ R_{\rm T}\sim 14 ~(\rho_{\rm gas}/10^5 {\rm H_2~cm^{-3}})^{-1/2}~{\rm pc}$. This suggests suppression of star formation and a top-heavy IMF in the circmunuclear region.</description>

      <title>NLTE spectral modelling for a carbon-oxygen and helium white-dwarf merger as a Ca-rich transient candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulations to determine whether explosion during the merger of a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) with a helium (He) WD can reproduce the characteristic Ca II/[Ca II] and He I lines observed in Ca-rich transients. Our study is based on a 1D representation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ CO + 0.4 $M_{\odot}$ He WD merger. We calculate both photospheric and nebular-phase spectra including treatment for non-thermal electrons, as is required for accurate modelling of He I and [Ca II]. Consistent with Ca-rich transients, our simulation predicts a nebular spectrum dominated by emission from [Ca II] 7291, 7324 angstrom and the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. The photospheric-phase synthetic spectrum also exhibits a strong Ca II NIR triplet, prominent optical absorption due to He I 5876 angstrom and He I 10830 angstrom in the NIR, as is commonly observed for Ca-rich transients. Overall, our results therefore suggest that CO+He WD mergers are a promising channel for Ca-rich transients. However, the current simulation overpredicts some He I features, in particular both He I 6678 and 7065 angstrom and shows a significant contribution from Ti II, which results in a spectral energy distribution that is substantially redder than most Ca-rich transients at peak. Additionally the Ca II nebular emission features are too broad. Future work should investigate if these discrepancies can be resolved by considering full 3D models and exploring a range of CO+He WD binary configurations.</description>
