      <title>Observed Timescales of Stellar Feedback in Star-Forming, Low-Mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the timescales of atomic gas turbulence is crucial to understanding the interplay between star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate the timescales of turbulence low-mass galaxies ($10^{6.8}&lt;M_\odot&lt;10^9$), this study combines temporally resolved star formation histories (SFHs) -- derived from color-magnitude diagrams -- with kinematic data of the atomic and ionized hydrogen in a large sample of nearby, star-forming, low-mass galaxies. To best understand the timescales involved, SFHs and gas kinematics were analyzed in 400$\times$400 parsec regions to capture the local impacts of star formation. No strong correlation was found between the ionized gas velocity dispersion and the star formation activity over the past 5-500 Myr. In contrast, a consistent and significant correlation between the atomic hydrogen turbulence measures and the star formation activity t$\geq$100 Myr ago was identified. This correlation suggests the star formation activity and atomic gas are coupled on this timescale. This connection between star-formation activity $&gt;$100 Myr ago, and the HI turbulence properties, may be related to the time scales over which turbulence decays in the ISM. Additionally, the results demonstrate a possible difference in the global and local turbulence properties of low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The phase spiral's origin and evolution: indications from its varying properties across the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase spiral is a perturbation to the vertical phase-space distribution of stars in the Milky Way disk. We study the phase spiral's properties and how they vary with spatial position, in order to constrain its origin and evolution, as well as properties of the disk itself. We produce high resolution maps using two complementary data processing schemes: (a) we bin the Gaia proper motion sample in a disk parallel spatial grid, reaching distances up to 4 kpc; (b) we bin the spatially nearby line-of-sight velocity sample in terms of disk parallel orbital parameters. We find complex structure, most significantly with respect to Galactocentric radius and guiding radius, but also in Galactic azimuth and epicyclic action and phase. We find that spiral winding and rotation phase vary smoothly across the disk, with close-to-flat radial profiles. This uniform structure, in particular for the rotation phase, indicates that the phase spiral was sourced by one or many global perturbations. Curiously, this also implies that the winding time has a strong slope with respect to Galactocentric radius, with low values for the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Efficient semi-analytic modelling of Pop III star formation from Cosmic Dawn to Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time, from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.</description>

      <title>Testing the AGN unified model with simulated emission lines from the circumgalactic medium (CGM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity, area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq 10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires $\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Galactic Supernova Remnants and Supernova Remnant Candidates from the EMU/POSSUM Radio Sky Surveys. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use data from the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) and POSSUM (Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism) radio southern sky surveys, conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), to compile a catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and candidate SNRs within the region of $277.5^\circ \leq \ell \leq 311.7^\circ$ Galactic longitude, $|b| \leq 5.4^\circ$ Galactic latitude, as well as an additional field along the Galactic plane, approximately $315.5^\circ \leq \ell \leq 323.0^\circ$ Galactic longitude, $-4.5^\circ \leq b \leq 1.5^\circ$ Galactic latitude. In the areas studied, there are 44 known SNRs and 46 SNR candidates that have been previously identified in the radio. We confirm eight of these candidates as SNRs based on evidence of linear polarization or through the calculation of nonthermal spectral indices. Additionally, we identify possible radio counterparts for seven SNR candidates that were previously only identified in X-rays (four) or optical (three). We also present six new SNRs and 37 new SNR candidates. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of ASKAP for discovering new and potential SNRs and refining the classification of previously identified candidates. In particular, we find that the EMU and POSSUM surveys are particularly well suited for observing high-latitude SNRs and confirming SNR candidates with polarization. The region studied in this work represents approximately one-quarter of the Galactic plane, by longitude, that will eventually be surveyed by EMU/POSSUM and we expect that the ongoing surveys will continue to uncover new SNRs and SNR candidates.</description>

      <title>A song of interactions and mergers: The case of NGC 4709</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental tools to unveil the interaction and merger history of their host galaxies. Our goal is to perform the photometric analysis of the globular cluster system (GCS) of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4709, which is the brightest galaxy of the Cen 45 spiral rich galaxy group, and to highlight its interaction history with NGC 4696, the giant elliptical galaxy of the Cen 30 subcluster. Using Magellan 6.5 m MegaCam (g, r, i) photometry, with which we identified a sample of 556 GC candidates around NGC 4709 that were analyzed in the context of the interaction history with the giant elliptical NGC 4696 and other galaxies of the Cen 45 group. Our results point toward a complex interaction history that shaped the GCS of NGC 4709. The GCS is characterized by a bimodal color distribution. Its azimuthal distribution shows a peak coinciding with the direction of NGC 4696, confirming that the interaction between these galaxies shaped the GCS of NGC 4709. From the GC luminosity function, we derived a distance of about 29.9 Mpc, which is much closer than the other galaxies of the Centaurus cluster, and a specific frequency of about 3.7, in good agreement with previously estimated values. From the GCs density maps, we identified overdensities corresponding to the positions of five other galaxies of the Centaurus cluster, and we found a bridge of GCs connecting NGC 4709 to NGC 4696. All of these findings point toward a complex GCS for NGC 4709, strongly influenced by the interaction with NGC 4696, and confirm previous findings that its apparent distance is smaller than that of the main cluster galaxy NGC 4696 by about 8.5 Mpc and that it is smaller than the distance of the other Centaurus galaxies, making it an outlier in Centaurus and suggesting a past first encounter with Cen 30.</description>

      <title>MINERVA: A NIRCam Medium Band and MIRI Imaging Survey to Unlock the Hidden Gems of the Distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$ 7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $&lt; z &lt;$ 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.</description>

      <title>Radio signatures of AGN-wind-driven shocks in elliptical galaxies: From simulations to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synchrotron emission signatures of shocks driven by active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic $\textit{MACER}$ numerical simulations. Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures will serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>VLBI studies of FLASH H I 21-cm absorbers - I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted VLBA 1.4 GHz (L-band) continuum observations towards twelve sources with HI 21-cm absorption detections at redshift $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7$ in the pilot surveys of FLASH, an ongoing survey with the ASKAP radio telescope. 11 of the 12 targets are resolved in the VLBA observations. Using the parsec scale radio images, we have classified the source morphology and identified the radio core. Six of the twelve targets have core-jet morphology, four have two-sided jet morphology, one has a complex morphology, and one is unresolved. We describe a methodology to test whether the emission from the core or the total emission detected in the VLBA image has sufficient flux density to cause the entire HI 21-cm absorption, and we estimate limits on the gas covering factor and velocity-integrated optical depth (VOD). We find that for seven of the twelve sources, the core has sufficient flux density to cause all the HI 21-cm absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum. For three other targets, with projected sizes in the range $\rm 305-409 \ pc$, a large fraction of the entire emission in the VLBA map could be occulted by the gas. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846), we estimate that at least $\approx 73\%$ of the peak absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum could arise against the emission detected in the VLBA image. For the target 0023+010 (NVSS J002331+010114), we estimate an upper limit on the VOD of $\rm 169 \ km \ s^{-1}$, the highest in our sample. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846) we estimate a lower limit of $\rm 104 \ km \ s^{-1}$ on the VOD. We find that the distribution of HI 21-cm VODs at $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0$ could increase by up to a factor of three after correction for the covering factors using our VLBA measurements.</description>

      <title>Interpreting nebular emission lines in the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe ($z \geq 5$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as $30 \%$ compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end ($&gt;10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.</description>

Abstract: The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy provides us with the unique opportunity to study an ongoing Galactic cannibalistic event between our Milky Way Galaxy and a satellite dwarf galaxy. We present the first major membership star catalog of the Sagittarius dwarf core ($\approx$400,000 sources) and Messier 54 ($\approx$2000 sources) with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes from $Gaia$ DR3, supplemented with metallicities from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We isolate the Sagittarius dwarf core (3.7 core radii) and Messier 54 (0.125 core radii) using literature positions. Using evolutionary sub-samples separated within a color-magnitude diagram, we analyze the structures and substructures of the Sagittarius core and infer its positional relationship with Messier 54 within 5D phase space. A sample of Milky Way stars from a similar galactic latitude was used to identify contaminants and separate member stars from the core of the Sgr dSph and Messier 54 using a Gaussian distribution in proper motion space. We present the derived proper motion, parallaxes, and metallicities for these evolutionary sub-samples while demonstrating the precision of our sample using red clump standard candles. We find a distance modulus for the Sagittarius core and Messier 54 of $(m-M)_{0}=17.002^{+0.038}_{-0.042}$ mag and $(m-M)_{0}=17.011^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$ mag, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of $d=25.14^{+0.45}_{-0.48}$ kpc and $d=25.25^{+0.48}_{-0.45}$ kpc respectively. With red clump distance analysis, our results imply there is no separation between the Sagittarius core and Messier 54.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${&gt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.</description>

      <title>ULISSE: Determination of star-formation rate and stellar mass based on the one-shot galaxy imaging technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern sky surveys produce vast amounts of observational data, making the application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases, depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies, early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of sources nightly.</description>

      <title>Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z &gt; 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A deep dive down the broad-line region: permitted OI, CaII and FeII emission in an AGN Little Red Dot at z=5.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$\lambda$1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI$\lambda$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio is highly suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation $A_V \sim 0.4$-$1.0$. We identify Ly$\beta$ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$\lambda$8446 equivalent width and weak OI$\lambda$7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$\lambda$8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.</description>

      <title>Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass Relation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count. This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent `failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later assembly.</description>

      <title>Temperature based radial metallicity gradients in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase abundances provide insights into the baryon cycle, with radial gradients and 2D metallicity distributions tracking how metals build up and redistribute within galaxy disks over cosmic time. We use a catalog of 22,958 HII regions across 19 nearby spiral galaxies to examine how precisely the radial abundance gradients can be traced using only the [NII]5755 electron temperature as a proxy for `direct method' metallicities. Using 534 direct detections of the temperature sensitive [NII]5755 auroral line, we measure gradients in 15 of the galaxies. Leveraging our large catalog of individual HII regions, we stack in bins of HII region [NII]6583 luminosity and radius to recover stacked radial gradients. We find good agreement between the metallicity gradients from the stacked spectra, those gradients from individual regions and those from strong line methods. In addition, particularly in the stacked Te([NII]) measurements, some galaxies show very low (&lt;0.05 dex) scatter in metallicities, indicative of a well-mixed ISM. We examine individual high confidence (S/N &gt; 5) outliers and identify 13 regions across 9 galaxies with anomalously low metallicity, although this is not strongly reflected in the strong line method metallicities. By stacking arm and interarm regions, we find no systematic evidence for offsets in metallicity between these environments, suggesting enrichment within spiral arms is due to very localized processes. This work demonstrates the potential to systematically exploit the single [NII]5755 auroral line for detailed gas-phase abundance studies of galaxies. It provides strong validation of previous results, based on the strong line calibrations, of a well-mixed ISM across typical star-forming spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Milky Way bar and bulge with an initially S\'{e}rsic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the formation of a bar plus box/peanut bulge (BP bulge) component in a Milky Way-like disc galaxy using simulations of isolated multi-component systems that evolve from equilibrium initial conditions. The simulations are designed to test the hypothesis that the bar forms early on and thickens to create the bulge. To this end, our initial conditions include a stellar disc with a S\'{e}rsic surface density profile and do not include any classical bulge component. We also include a gas disc, which is important in regulating the growth of the bar. Our best-fit model has an initial stellar disc with a S\'{e}rsic index of $n = 1.75$ and a gas disc with mass equal to 7% of the mass of the stellar disc. The model reproduces the bar size, pattern speed, and box/peanut shape of the Milky Way's bulge+bar.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Satellite Quenching at Intermediate Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the processes by which galaxies transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last $\sim$5Gyr. This is consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Survival of higher overdensity cold gas in a turbulent, multiphase medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.</description>

      <title>Probing the Neutral Fraction of the Warm Ionized Medium via [NI] 5200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the ionized mass in the Milky Way is in the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM) and not in the bright H~II regions. The WIM is traced by dispersion measure and has been extensively studied in recombination lines (primarily, H$\alpha$) and optical nebular lines (primarily, S+ and N+). The observations can be well explained by a photo-ionized nebula with a low ionization parameter. It is generally thought that the source of ionization (and heating) of the WIM is due to Lyman continuum leaking from HII regions which are concentrated in the Galactic plane. The rays of the diffuse Galactic Lyman-continuum radiation field incident on the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) are absorbed, forming an ionized skin. In nebulae with low-ionization parameter the transition from ionized gas to neutral gas is gradual, unlike the case for HII regions with their sharp Stromgren spheres. The transition region is warm enough to excite oxygen and nitrogen atoms to emit [OI] 6300,6363 and [NI] 5198,5200. Domgorgen &amp; Mathis (1994) recognized the value of [OI] 6300 as a diagnostic of the fraction of the diffuse continuum that is absorbed by the WNM and therefore constrains the fraction of the diffuse Lyman continuum that escapes to the halo. Unfortunately, observations of Galactic [OI] 6300 have been stymied by bright [OI] 6300 airglow emission. [NI] 5200,5198 has been a historically less popular probe because this doublet is less luminous than the oxygen doublet. However, we point out that the [NI] airglow is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of [OI]. Furthermore, even in the presence of comparable airglow, the WIM [NI] emission can be inferred using the doublet intensity ratio for which a medium-resolution spectrometer such as the Local Volume Mapper will suffice. Separately, we note, in extragalactic systems, that [OI]6300/[NI]5200 is a robust measure of the O/N abundance ratio.</description>

      <title>Methyl Isocyanate Formation from Oxygen Insertion in Methyl Cyanide Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$, offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2023ixf II: The Panchromatic Evolution Between 250 and 720 Days After the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30$\mu$m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0$\mu$m, with a secondary bump at 18.0$\mu$m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.</description>

      <title>Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity and the Mass-Dimension Field Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM) paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension $D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied with these methods.
  In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model, which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R \right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$ which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new $D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC 6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.</description>

      <title>Young Stellar Objects in the Carina nebula: Near-Infrared variability and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified 606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs, dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.</description>

      <title>New symbiotic stars or candidates in LAMOST low resolution spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are among the most crucial binary systems for studying binary star interactions and Type Ia supernova progenitors. Based on the unique observational characteristics of symbiotic stars, strong H I, He I emission lines, giant spectral features, and the presence of [O III], He II, O VI, and other emission lines with ionization potentials exceeding 35 eV, and the Gaia information, we search for new symbiotic stars using the low-resolution spectroscopic survey data from LAMOST. Thirty-six binary systems have been selected as symbiotic stars or candidates, in which the five known symbiotic stars are included. Among them five systems (ZTF J005917.52+315605.4, ATO J094137.5+075304, LAMOST J200310.90+360822.6, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4, and V* V758 Cyg) have been found as new symbiotic stars. Notably, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4 and V* V758 Cyg were also confirmed as new symbiotic stars in a recent study. For the remaining 26 candidates, classification is based solely on the presence of [O III] emission lines (with ionization potentials &gt; 35 eV) and the absence of He II high-excitation emission lines. Further observations are needed to confirm their nature as symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission from Type Ia Supernova Remnants Interacting With Isotropic Progenitor Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Perseus Cluster I: Resolving the Si/S/Ar/Ca ratios by Stellar Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 -- 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Galactic Super-Accreting X-ray Binaries as Super-PeVatron Accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates the existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer to as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a challenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray binaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the Eddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy population of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets and/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding $10^{39} \, \rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV. Detection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray ``halos" and large-scale nebulae is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Formation History of Intrahalo Light with Horizon Run 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation history of intrahalo light (IHL) using the high-resolution (~1 kpc), large-scale (~Gpc) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Horizon Run 5 (HR5). IHL particles are identified by carefully considering both their binding energies and positions with respect to the tidal radii of individual galaxies. By analyzing more than 1,200 galaxy groups and clusters with $\geq 10^{13} M_{\odot}$ and tracing their individual IHL particles back in time, we classify the origin of each IHL particle at each epoch based on the status of the originating galaxy into three categories: brightest halo galaxy (BHG) formation/merger, satellite galaxy stripping, and pre-processing. Our study reveals that the IHL production through BHG formation/merger is the predominant production channel, contributing over 60\% of the total IHL mass across all redshifts. The second most significant IHL production channel is pre-processing, providing more than 20\% in the final HR5 snapshot. Stripping is negligible at $z&gt;4$ but becomes gradually more important as halos mature at $z&lt;4$. Finally, we verify that IHL production through the disruption of dwarf galaxies and in-situ formation is negligible, contributing less than ~3\% and ~0.5\% to the total IHL production, respectively.</description>

      <title>Extended red wings and the visibility of reionization-epoch Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visibility of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from reionization-epoch galaxies depends sensitively on the extent of the intrinsic \lya emission redwards of 1215.67~\AA. The prominent red peak resulting from resonant radiative transfer in the interstellar medium is often modelled as a single Gaussian. We use the \textsc{Azahar} simulation suite of a massive-reionization epoch galaxy to show that a significantly larger fraction of the \lya emission extends to $400$-$800$~km~s$^{-1}$, and thus significantly further to the red than predicted by a Gaussian line profile. A cycle of frequent galaxy mergers strongly modulates the \lya luminosity, the red peak velocity and its extended red wing emerging from the galaxy, which all also strongly vary with viewing angle. The \lya emission also depends sensitively on the implemented feedback, dust and star formation physics. Our simulations including cosmic rays reproduce the observed spectral properties of reionization epoch \lya emitters (LAEs) well if we assume that the \lya emission is affected by very little dust. The visibility of LAEs can be strongly underestimated if the extended red wings of the intrinsic \lya emission are not accounted for. We discuss implications for using the visibility of LAEs to constrain the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral fraction during reionization.</description>

      <title>Variable gravitational potential of Milky Way analogues in HESTIA suite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigations of trajectories of various objects orbiting the Milky Way (MW) halo with modern precision, achievable in observations by Gaia, requires sophisticated, non-stationary models of the Galactic potential. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the spherical harmonics expansion of MW analogues potential in constrained simulations of the Local Group (LG) from the HESTIA suite. We find that at distances $r\ge 100$~kpc the non-spherical part of the potential demonstrates a significant impact of the environment: ignoring the mass distribution outside the virial radius of the MW results in $&gt;$20\% errors in the potential quadrupole at these distances. {Account of the environment results in a noticeable change of the angular momenta of objects orbiting MW analogues}. Spherical harmonics vary significantly during the last 6 Gyr. We attribute variations of the potential at $r\ge 30$~kpc to the motions of MW satellites and LG galaxies. We also predict that the non-sphericity of the real MW potential should grow with distance in the range $r_\mathrm{vir}&lt;r&lt;500$~kpc, since all realizations of simulated MW-like objects demonstrate such a trend.</description>

Abstract: Mapping the Milky Way spiral arms in the vertical direction remains a challenging task that has received little attention. Taking advantage of recent results that link the position of the Galactic spiral arms to metal-rich regions in the disc, we analyse a sample of young giant stars from {\it Gaia} DR3 and use their metallicity distribution to produce a 3D metallicity excess map. The map shows signatures of the spiral arms, whose vertical height vary across the Galactic disc, reaching up to 400 pc in amplitude and exhibiting vertical asymmetries with respect to the mid-plane. Specifically, the Perseus arm displays a high vertical asymmetry consistent with the Galactic warp. Moreover, we find evidence of a metal-rich stellar structure that undulates vertically, nearly in phase with the arrangement of star-forming regions named the Radcliffe Wave. This new structure is larger and extends beyond the Radcliffe Wave, reaching vertical amplitudes of $\sim$ 270 pc and extending for at least 4 kpc in length. We confirm that for at least half of its length this Extended Radcliffe Wave is the inner edge of the Local Arm. The finding of a metal-rich stellar counterpart of the Radcliffe Wave shows that mapping the three-dimensional metallicity distribution of young stellar populations reveals key information about the structures and chemical enrichment in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas in cool-core brightest cluster galaxies at $z\simeq0.4$</title>

Abstract: Brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) are today passive and very massive galaxies at the center of their clusters, still accreting mass through swallowing companions, and flows of cold gas, regulated by radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. However, their formation history is still a matter of debate. We report new results based on millimeter observations performed with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer, mapping the cold molecular gas (CO) that feeds the star formation of distant BCGs. We selected three among the strongest cool-core BCGs at intermediate redshifts ($z\simeq0.4$), namely RX 1532, MACS 1447, and CHIPS 1911. Previous unresolved millimeter observations and multi-wavelength analysis showed that they are among the most star forming (${\rm SFR}\simeq100~ M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and gas rich ($M_{H_2}\simeq10^{11}~M_\odot$) BCGs at intermediate redshifts. The selected BCGs are thus caught in a phase of rapid mass assembly, which makes them ideal targets for high-resolution observations of their molecular gas. By combining NOEMA intensity and velocity maps with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we detect in-situ star formation, filaments of accreting cold gas likely regulated by AGN feedback, disturbed morphology associated with tidal tails of molecular gas, as well as gas compression and tails originated from stripping of gas. While effective condensation of the intra-cluster medium is required to explain the large molecular gas reservoirs, the BCGs exhibit a broad variety of environment-driven mechanisms responsible for the processing of their cold gas: flows of cooling gas (RX 1532), ram pressure or sloshing of the intra-cluster medium (MACS 1447), and galactic tides (CHIPS 1911). This study thus sheds new insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the mass assembly of galaxies hosting AGN at the center of clusters.</description>

      <title>DAWN JWST Archive: Morphology from profile fitting of over 340 000 galaxies in major fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 12$, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, S\'ersic index ($n_S$), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high $n_S$ and $B/T$) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the $UVJ$ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to $z &gt; 3$. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at $z \sim 4$ than at $z \sim 1$. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.</description>

      <title>Pavo: Stellar feedback in action in a low-mass dwarf galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy, Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in archival HI single dish data. We measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.</description>

      <title>ChemZz I: Comparing Oxygen and Iron Abundance Patterns in the Milky Way, the Local Group and Cosmic Noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies has advanced through measurements from both distant galaxies across redshift, and our own Milky Way (MW). To form a comprehensive picture, it is essential to unify these constraints, placing them on a common scale and parlance and to understand their systematic differences. In this study, we homogenize oxygen and iron measurements from star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z{\sim}2-3$) with resolved stellar abundances from the Local Group. The MW is divided into four components, assuming the outer halo is dominated by debris from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor. After converting all abundances to a common Solar scale, we identify clear $\alpha$- and iron-enhancement trends with mass in the $z{\sim}2-3$ galaxies and find good agreement between these galaxies and the MW high-$\alpha$ disc in [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]. We also find excellent agreement between the [O/Fe] trends seen in the MW high- and low-$\alpha$ discs with O-abundances seen in old and young planetary nebulae in M~31 respectively, supporting the existence of $\alpha$-bimodality in the inner regions of M~31. Finally, we use globular cluster ages to project the MW and GSE back in time to $z{\sim}3$ and find that their estimated mass, oxygen and iron abundances are strikingly consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}3$. In the future, increased transparency around the choice of Solar scale and abundance methodology will make combining chemical abundances easier -- contributing to a complete picture of the chemical evolution of all galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$&gt;$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Tremaine-Weinberg method at high redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies with bars sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominantly regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Faster than SAM: An empirical model for the tidal evolution of dark matter substructure around strong gravitational lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses enable direct inference of halo abundance and internal structure, which in turn enable constraints on the nature of dark matter and the primordial matter power spectrum. However, the density profiles of dark subhalos around the main deflector of a strong lens system also depend on tidal evolution inside the host, complicating the interpretation of strong-lensing inferences. We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that accurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally stripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector for a variety of dark matter models. This model matches predictions from the semianalytic model (SAM) {\sc galacticus}, but enables the simulation of subhalo populations in seconds, rather than hours. We use this model to examine the expected number of subhalos near the Einstein radius of a typical lens, and examine their lensing signals. We show that in cold dark matter the amplitude of the bound mass function is suppressed by a factor of $20$ relative to the infall mass function, and $87 \%$ of subhalos appearing in projection near the Einstein radius of a typical strong lensing deflector have lost more than $80\%$ of their mass since infall. Tidal stripping becomes increasingly severe in dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, such as warm dark matter. This model will be used to forward model subhalo populations in forthcoming analyses of strong lens systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the errors in modeling the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect at large linear scales, using data from the Millennium simulation. While standard theoretical templates, such as the Kaiser formula and the TNS method, could precisely model RSD for individual large-scale modes, we find that for tracers with number densities lower than $\sim10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, there is a few-percent level bias in the predicted power spectrum. This error arises due to the amplification of intrinsic Poisson noise during RSD modeling from real-space power spectrum. This amplified noise can be analytically expressed as $1 + \epsilon/[{\bar{n}P}({1+\epsilon})]$, with $\epsilon=2\beta/3+\beta^2/5$, where $P$ denotes the real-space tracer power spectrum and $\beta \equiv f/b$. Specifically, for halos with a number density of around $5\times10^{-4}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, this phenomenon results in an additional systematic error of 2.5\%. Our result suggests that caution is necessary when directly modeling redshift-space distortions (RSD) using real-space power spectra of tracers obtained from simulations or actual surveys. This caution is particularly pertinent in scenarios where emulators trained on simulation data forecast the real-space tracer power spectrum, as well as in baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction using galaxy samples, for which we estimate that shot noise could introduce random errors of about one-third in the displacement field, potentially diminishing the effectiveness of the BAO peak sharpening.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23899</link>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observation of the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster: Quiescent Velocity Structure in the Dynamically Disturbed Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the high-resolution X-rayspectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^-1 in the inner region (~&lt; 25 kpc) and sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^-1 in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.8 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk| = 8 +/- 7 km s^-1), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk| = 104 +/- 7 km s^-1. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is ~ 40\% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not currently balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum. Alternatively, the central galaxy and the associated hot gas could be moving nearly parallel to the plane of the sky.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder than those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral slope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of TNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>
