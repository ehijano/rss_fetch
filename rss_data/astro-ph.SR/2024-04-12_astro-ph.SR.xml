      <title>Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP (XP) spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder; a $\textit{scatter}$ VAE, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and intrinsic scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality $\textit{without relying on stellar label correlations}$, for stars with $T_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 5000 K. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.</description>

      <title>EUV observables of simulated plasmoid-mediated reconnection in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of magnetic reconnection in the heating and dynamics of the solar atmosphere requires detailed observational data of any observable aspect of the reconnection process, including small-scale features such as plasmoids. We aim to examine the capability of active and upcoming instruments to detect plasmoids generated by reconnection in the corona including low-density regimes. We used the Bifrost code to perform simulations of plasmoid-mediated reconnection in the corona based on a 2D idealised setup: a fan-spine topology with uniform density including thermal conduction. Through forward-modelling of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observables, we checked whether our simulated plasmoids could be detected with the instruments of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar Orbiter (SO), as well as the upcoming Multi-Slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) and Solar-C missions. Short-lived (10-20 s) small-scale (0.2-0.5 Mm) coronal plasmoids are not resolvable with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, but could be captured with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) of SO. The spatial and temporal high-resolution planned for the MUSE spectrograph (SG) is adequate to obtain full spectral information of these plasmoids. Detection of 0.8 MK plasmoids in the MUSE/SG 171 {\AA} channel should work on full-raster mode in regions with electron densities above 10^9 cm^3 whereas on sit-and-stare mode for lower-density regions. Solar-C could also capture these coronal plasmoids using the EUV High-Throughput Spectroscopic Telescope (EUVST), through rapid changes in Doppler shift and line width in different EUV lines caused by plasmoid motions along the current sheet. With combined spectra of MUSE/SG and Solar-C/EUVST in multiple emission lines, along with high-resolution images from SO/EUI and MUSE/CI, it should be possible to gain new insights about plasmoid formation in the corona.</description>

      <title>The GALEX-Gaia-EDR3 Catalogue of Single and Binary White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of white dwarf candidates constructed from the GALEX and Gaia EDR3 catalogues. The catalogue contains 332,111 candidate binary white dwarf systems and 111,996 candidate single white dwarfs. Where available, the catalogue is augmented with photometry from Pan-STARRS DR1, SDSS DR12 and classifications from StarHorse. We fit photometric data with modeled white dwarf cooling sequences to derive mass, age and effective temperature of the white dwarf as well as mass estimates for the companion. We test our classifications against StarHorse, the Gentile-Fusillo Gaia EDR3 catalogue, and white-dwarf-main-sequence binaries identified in SDSS DR12. This catalogue provides a unique probe of the binarity of white dwarfs as well as the abundance of white-dwarf giant binaries and large mass-ratio stellar binaries which are difficult to probe otherwise.</description>

      <title>Kinematic age of the $\beta$-Pictoris moving group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including formation and evolution of stars, planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The $\beta$-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from $\sim$10 to 25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14 to 20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by $\sim2-4$ Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1 to 2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of BPMG to be 16.3$^{+3.4}_{-2.1}$ Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG ($\sim$24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.</description>

      <title>The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue: properties of radio stars at megahertz to gigahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue, a new catalogue of stars detected at megahertz to gigahertz radio frequencies. It consists of 839 unique stars with 3,405 radio detections, more than doubling the previously known number of radio stars. We have included stars from large area searches for radio stars found using circular polarisation searches, cross-matching, variability searches, and proper motion searches as well as presenting hundreds of newly detected stars from our search of Australian SKA Pathfinder observations. The focus of this first version of the catalogue is on objects detected in surveys using SKA precursor instruments; however we will expand this scope in future versions. The 839 objects in the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue are distributed across the whole sky and range from ultracool dwarfs to Wolf-Rayet stars. We find that the radio luminosities of cool dwarfs are lower than the radio luminosities of more evolved sub-giant and giant stars. We use X-ray detections of 530 radio stars by the eROSITA soft X-ray instrument onboard the SRG spacecraft to show that almost all of the radio stars in the catalogue are over-luminous in the radio, indicating that the majority of stars at these radio frequencies are coherent radio emitters. The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue can be found in Vizier or at https://radiostars.org.</description>

      <title>Evolution of rotating massive stars adopting a newer, self-consistent wind prescription at SMC metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Geneva-evolution-code to run evolutionary tracks for stellar masses ranging from $20$ to $85$ $M_\odot$ at SMC metallicity ($Z=0.002$). We upgrade the recipe for stellar winds by adopting our self-consistent m-CAK prescription, which reduces the value of mass-loss rate by a factor between 2 and 6 depending on the mass range.
  The impact of our new winds is wide, and it can be divided between direct and indirect impact. For the most massive models ($60$ and $85$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\gtrsim2\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is direct because lower mass loss make stars remove less envelope and therefore remain more massive and less chemically enriched at their surface at the end of their MS phase. For the less massive models ($20$ and $25$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\lesssim2\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is indirect because lower mass loss make the stars keep high rotational velocities for a longer period of time, then extending the H-core burning lifetime and reaching the end of the MS with higher surface enrichment. Given that the conditions at the H-depletion change, the stars will lose more mass during their He-core burning stages anyways. For $M_\text{zams}=20$ to $40$ $M_\odot$, our models predict stars will evolve through the Hertzsprung gap, from O-type supergiants to BSG and finally RSG, with larger mass fractions of helium compared to old evolution models. New models also set down to $M_\text{zams}=85\,M_\odot$ the minimal initial mass required for a single star to become WR at metallicity $Z=0.002$.
  New values for $\dot M$ need to be complemented with upgrades in additional features such as convective core overshooting and distribution of rotational velocities, besides more detailed observations from projects such as XShootU, in order to provide a robust framework for the study of massive stars at low metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>High speed stars: III. Detailed abundances and binary nature of the extreme speed star GHS143</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia satellite has provided the community with three releases containing astrometrical and photometric data as well as by products, such as stellar parameters and variability indicators. By selecting in the Gaia database, one can select stars with the requested characteristics, such as high speed. At present any selection is based on available Gaia releases including a subset of the observations. This, for some stars, can show some limitations, for example there is still not a sufficient number of observations to detect binarity. We investigated a star selected in Gaia EDR3 for its high speed that appears unbound to the Galaxy. We requested high-quality spectra to derive more information on the star. {From the spectroscopic investigation we confirm the low metallicity content of the star, and we derive a detailed chemical composition. The star is poor in carbon and very rich in oxygen: [(C+N+O)/Fe]=+0.65. From the two spectra observed we conclude that the star is in a binary system and from the investigation of the ionisation balance we derive that the star is closer than implied by the Gaia DR3 parallax, and thus has a a lower intrinsic luminosity. The star is probably still unbound, but there is the possibility that it is bound to the Galaxy. Its low carbon abundance suggests that the star was formed in a dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called ``torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10 percent, the ``Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability renowned in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Atmospheric Characterization of the 1RXS J034231.8+121622 System Using High-Resolution Spectroscopy Confirms That The Companion is a Low-Mass Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system consists of an M dwarf primary and a directly imaged low-mass stellar companion. We use high resolution spectroscopic data from Keck/KPIC to estimate the objects' atmospheric parameters and radial velocities (RVs). Using PHOENIX stellar models, we find that the primary has a temperature of 3460 $\pm$ 50 K a metallicity of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04, while the secondary has a temperature of 2510 $\pm$ 50 K and a metallicity of $0.13\substack{+0.12 \\ -0.11}$. Recent work suggests this system is associated with the Hyades, placing it an older age than previous estimates. Both metallicities agree with current $[Fe/H]$ Hyades measurements (0.11 -- 0.21). Using stellar evolutionary models, we obtain significantly higher masses for the objects, of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_\odot$ and 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_\odot$ (84 $\pm$ 11 $M_{Jup}$) respectively. Using the RVs and a new astrometry point from Keck/NIRC2, we find that the system is likely an edge-on, moderately eccentric ($0.41\substack{+0.27 \\ -0.08}$) configuration. We also estimate the C/O ratio of both objects using custom grid models, obtaining 0.42 $\pm$ 0.10 (primary) and 0.55 $\pm$ 0.10 (companion). From these results, we confirm that this system most likely went through a binary star formation process in the Hyades. The significant changes in this system's parameters since its discovery highlight the importance of high resolution spectroscopy for both orbital and atmospheric characterization of directly imaged companions.</description>

      <title>M-dwarf flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility data and what we can learn from them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting M-dwarf flares using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility data releases (ZTF DRs). We employ two different approaches: the traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm originally developed for anomaly detection. We analyzed over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinized 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and known variable objects of other types. Our final sample comprises 134 flares with amplitude ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares and complex flares with multiple components. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we also assigned a corresponding spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves, we estimated the bolometric energy. Our results show that the ZTF's cadence strategy is suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>

      <title>Transit Spectroscopy of K2-33b with Subaru/IRD: Spin-Orbit Alignment and Tentative Atmospheric Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets in their infancy are ideal targets to probe the formation and evolution history of planetary systems, including the planet migration and atmospheric evolution and dissipation. In this paper, we present spectroscopic observations and analyses of two planetary transits of K2-33b, which is known to be one of the youngest transiting planets (age $\approx 8-11$ Myr) around a pre-main-sequence M-type star. Analysing K2-33's near-infrared spectra obtained by the IRD instrument on Subaru, we investigate the spin-orbit angle and transit-induced excess absorption for K2-33b. We attempt both classical modelling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and Doppler-shadow analyses for the measurements of the projected stellar obliquity, finding a low angle of $\lambda=-6_{-58}^{+61}$ deg (for RM analysis) and $\lambda=-10_{-24}^{+22}$ deg (for Doppler-shadow analysis). In the modelling of the RM effect, we allow the planet-to-star radius ratio to float freely to take into account the possible smaller radius in the near infrared, but the constraint we obtain ($R_p/R_s=0.037_{-0.017}^{+0.013}$) is inconclusive due to the low radial-velocity precision. Comparison spectra of K2-33 of the 1083 nm triplet of metastable ortho-He I obtained in and out of the 2021 transit reveal excess absorption that could be due to an escaping He-rich atmosphere. Under certain conditions on planet mass and stellar XUV emission, the implied escape rate is sufficient to remove an Earth-mass H/He in $\sim$1 Gyr, transforming this object from a Neptune to a super-Earth.</description>

      <title>Proto-Neutron Star Convection and the Neutrino-Driven Wind: Implications for the $\nu$p-Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of the neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron stars have indicated that the wind is likely proton-rich for much of its lifetime, and the high flux of neutrinos can induce $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis allowing for the formation of heavy elements. It has also been shown that gravito-acoustic waves, generated by convection within the proto-neutron star, can significantly alter the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in the wind. Therefore, we present a study of the effects of convection-driven waves on the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds, focusing on the $\nu$p-process. We find that wave effects can strongly impact $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis even at wave luminosities a factor of $10^{-5}$ smaller than the total neutrino luminosity. The momentum flux of the waves accelerates the wind, reducing the net neutrino heating and the persistent neutron abundance created by p($\bar{\nu}_e,e^+$), which impedes $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis. However, this effect is generally counteracted by the effects of waves on seed nucleus formation, as the acceleration of the wind and the heating that occurs as these waves shock both favor a more $\alpha$-rich environment with very little heavy seed-nucleus formation. Overall, higher wave luminosities correlate (albeit non-monotonically) with heavier element $\nu$p-processing, up to $A\approx 200$ in some cases. At very high wave luminosities ($\gtrsim 10^{-3}L_\nu$), early shock heating by the waves disrupts $\alpha$ recombination, and drives a suppressed, fast-outflow r-process proceeding up to $A\approx 200$. This occurs despite an assumed neutrino spectrum that predicts a proton-rich wind with equilibrium $Y_e=0.6$.</description>

      <title>Proper motion study of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser rings. I. A sample of sources with little variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methanol masers at 6.7~GHz are well-known signposts of high-mass star-forming regions. [...] We aim to understand the origin of the ring-like structures outlined by methanol maser emission in a number of sources. This emission could be, a priori, spatially associated with an outflow and/or disc around a high-mass protostar. [...] Using sensitive, three-epoch observations spanning over eight years with the European VLBI Network, we have started the most direct investigations of maser rings using very accurate proper motion measurements with uncertainties below 1\,km~s$^{-1}$. We present full results for the five targets of our sample, G23.207-00.377, G23.389+00.185, G28.817+00.365, G31.047+00.356, and G31.581+00.077, where proper motions show similar characteristics; maser cloudlets do not move inwards towards the centre of the rings but rather outwards. We also include the most circular source, G23.657-00.127, in the discussion as a reference. The magnitude of maser proper motions ranges from a maximum of about 13\,km~s$^{-1}$ to 0.5~km~s$^{-1}$. In two of the five sources with a high number of maser spots (&gt;100), namely G23.207-00.377 and G23.389+00.185, we show that the size of the best elliptical model, fitted to the distribution of persistent masers, increases in time in a manner similar to the case of G23.657-00.127. Moreover, we checked the separations between the pairs of spots from distinct regions, and we were able to assess that G28.817+00.365 and G31.047+00.356 can be interpreted as showing expanding motions. We analysed the profiles of single maser cloudlets and studied their variability. Contrary to single-dish studies, the interferometric data indicate variability of the emission of single-masing cloudlets. In five of the six targets expansion motions prevail. Only in the case of G31.581+00.077 can a scenario of disc-like rotation not be excluded. [...]</description>

      <title>Recovering the gas properties of protoplanetary disks through parametric visibility modeling: MHO 6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition and distribution of the gas in a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in shaping the outcome of the planet formation process. Observationally, the recovery of information such as the emission height and brightness temperature from interferometric data is often limited by the imaging processes. To overcome the limitations of image-reconstruction when analyzing gas emission from interferometric observations, we have introduced a parametric model to fit the main observable properties of the gaseous disk component in the visibility plane. This approach is also known as parametric visibility modeling. We applied our parametric visibility modeling to the gas brightness distribution of the molecular line emission from 12CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=3-2 in the disk around MHO 6, a very-low-mass star in the Taurus star-forming Region. To improve the flux fidelity of our parametric models, we combined models with different pixel resolution before the computation of their visibilities, referred to as ``nesting images.'' When we apply our parametric visibility modeling to MHO 6, with independent fits to the emission from its CO isopotologues, the models return the same consistent results for the stellar mass, disk geometry, and central velocity. The surface height and brightness temperature distribution are also recovered. When compared to other disks, MHO 6 surface height is among the most elevated surfaces, consistent with the predictions for disks around very-low-mass stars. This work demonstrates the feasibility of running rapidly iterable parametric visibility models in moderate resolution and sensitivity interferometric observations. More importantly, this methodology opens the analysis of disk's gas morphology to observations where image-based techniques are unable to robustly operate, as in the case of the compact disk around MHO 6.</description>

      <title>BeyonCE -- Light Curve Modelling Beyond Circular Eclipsers I. Shallot Explorer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Time-series photometry has given astronomers the tools to study time-dependent astrophysical phenomena, from stellar activity to fast radio bursts and exoplanet transits. Transit events in particular are focused primarily on planetary transits, and eclipsing binaries with eclipse geometries that are parameterised with a few variables, while more complex light curves caused by substructure within the transiting object require customized analysis code.
  Aims. We present Beyond Circular Eclipsers (BeyonCE), which reduces the parameter space encompassed by the transit of circum-secondary disc (CSD) systems with azimuthally symmetric non-uniform optical depth profiles. By rejecting disc geometries that cannot reproduce the measured gradients within their light curves, we can constrain the size and orientation of discs with complex sub-structure.
  Methods. We map out all the possible geometries of a disc, calculate the gradients for rings crossing the star, then reject those configurations where the measured gradient of the light curve is greater than the theoretical gradient from the given disc orientation.
  Results. We present the fitting code BeyonCE and demonstrate its effectiveness in considerably reducing the parameter space of discs that contain azimuthally symmetric structure by analyzing the light curves seen towards J1407 and PDS 110 which are attributed to CSD transits.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in the GG Tau A system: investigating its enigmatic disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GG Tau is one of the most studied multiple young stellar systems: GG Tau A is a hierarchical triple surrounded by a massive disc and its companion, GG Tau B, is also a binary. Despite numerous observational attempts, an understanding of the geometry of the GG Tau A system is still elusive. We provide new astrometric measures of the system and we run a set of hydrodynamical simulations with two representative orbits to test how they impact a disc composed of dust and gas. We test the dynamical evolution of the two scenarios on short and long timescales. We obtain synthetic flux emission from our simulations and we compare them with 1300 $\mu$m ALMA dust continuum emission and 1.67 $\mu$m SPHERE dust scattering images to infer the most likely orbital arrangement. We extend the analysis of the binary orbital parameters using six new epochs from archival data, showing that the current measurements alone are not capable of breaking the degeneracy between families of coplanar and misaligned orbits. We found that the time-scale for the onset of the disc eccentricity growth, $\tau_{ecc}$, is a fundamental time-scale for the morphology of the system. Results from numerical simulations show that the best match between is obtained with the misaligned configuration ($\Delta\theta= 30^\circ$) on timescales shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$. The results exhibit an almost circular cavity and dust ring. However, for both scenarios, the cavity size and its eccentricity quickly grow for timescales longer than $\tau_{ecc}$ and the models do not reproduce the observed morphology anymore. This implies that either the age of the system is shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$ or that the disc eccentricity growth is not triggered or dissipated. This finding raises questions on the future evolution of the GG Tau A system and, more in general, on the time evolution of eccentric binaries and their circumbinary discs.</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging and electron temperature evolution in laser-driven magnetic reconnection experiments at the National Ignition Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from X-ray imaging of high-aspect-ratio magnetic reconnection experiments driven at the National Ignition Facility. Two parallel, self-magnetized, elongated laser-driven plumes are produced by tiling 40 laser beams. A magnetic reconnection layer is formed by the collision of the plumes. A gated X-ray framing pinhole camera with micro-channel plate (MCP) detector produces multiple images through various filters of the formation and evolution of both the plumes and current sheet. As the diagnostic integrates plasma self-emission along the line of sight, 2-dimensional electron temperature maps $\langle T_e \rangle_Y$ are constructed by taking the ratio of intensity of these images obtained with different filters. The plumes have a characteristic temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 240 \pm 20$ eV at 2 ns after the initial laser irradiation and exhibit a slow cooling up to 4 ns. The reconnection layer forms at 3 ns with a temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 280 \pm 50$ eV as the result of the collision of the plumes. The error bars of the plumes and current sheet temperatures separate at $4$ ns, showing the heating of the current sheet from colder inflows. Using a semi-analytical model, we find that the observed heating of the current sheet is consistent with being produced by electron-ion drag, rather than the conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Supernova remnants of red supergiants: from barrels to Cygnus loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct massive stars which have died during a supernova explosion, mostly while undergoing the red supergiant phase of their evolution. The morphology and emission properties of those remnants are a function of the distribution of circumstellar material at the moment of the supernova, the intrisic properties of the explosion, as well as those of the ambient medium. By means of 2.5 dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we model the long term evolution of supernova remnants generated by runaway rotating massive stars moving into a magnetised interstellar medium. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that the projected non-thermal emission of the supernova remnants decreases with time, i.e. older remnants are fainter than younger ones. Older (80 kyr) supernova remnants whose progenitors were moving with space velocity corresponding to a Mach number M = 1 (v_star = 20 km/s ) in the Galactic plane of the ISM (nISM = 1/cm3 ) are brighter in synchrotron than when moving with a Mach number M = 2 (v_star = 40 km/s ). We show that runaway red supergiant progenitors first induce an asymmetric non thermal 1.4 GHz barrel like synchrotron supernova remnants (at the age of about 8 kyr), before further evolving to adopt a Cygnus loop like shape (at about 80 kyr). It is conjectured that a significative fraction of supernova remnants are currently in this bilateral-to-Cygnus-loop evolutionary sequence, and that this should be taken into account in the data interpretation of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.</description>

      <title>The effects of stellar feedback on molecular clumps in the Lagoon Nebula (M8)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.</description>

Abstract: We report multiepoch astrometric very long baseline interferometry observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the comoving reference frame with an inclination = $39.5^{+3.6}_{-3.5}\deg$ and longitude of ascending node $\Omega = 212\deg \pm 22\deg$. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by $\Delta \alpha = -0.81^{+0.37}_{-0.25}$, $\Delta \delta = 0.45^{+0.25}_{-0.23}$ mas. All radio centroids are well displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the interbinary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with $2\sigma$ upper limits in the range 200-1000 km/sec. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a $3\sigma$ detection $v_{\perp} = 228 \pm 85$ km/sec. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.</description>

      <title>The Galactic bulge exploration II. Line-of-sight velocity templates for single-mode RR~Lyrae stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new set of tools to derive systemic velocities for single-mode RR~Lyrae stars from visual and near-infrared spectra. We derived scaling relations and line-of-sight velocity templates using both APOGEE and {\it Gaia} spectroscopic products combined with photometric $G$-band amplitudes. We provide a means to estimate systemic velocities for the RR~Lyrae subclasses, RRab and RRc. Our analysis indicates that the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes is nonlinear, with a break in a linear relation occurring around 0.4mag in both the $V$-band and $G$-band amplitudes. We did not observe such a break in the relation for the first-overtone pulsators. Using stellar pulsation models, we further confirm and examine the nonlinearity in scaling relation for the RRab subclass. We observed little to no variation with stellar parameters (mass, metallicity, and luminosity) in the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes for fundamental-mode pulsators. We observed an offset in the scaling relation between the observations and stellar pulsation models, mainly in the low-amplitude RR~Lyrae regime. This offset disappears when different sets of convective parameters are used. Thus, the Fourier amplitudes obtained from the photometry and line-of-sight velocity measurements can be utilized to constrain convective parameters of stellar pulsation models. The scaling relations and templates for APOGEE and {\it Gaia} data accurately predict systemic velocities compared to literature values. In addition, our tools derived from the {\it Gaia} spectra improve the precision of the derived systemic velocities by approximately 50 percent and provide a better description of the uncertainty distribution in comparison with previous studies. Our newly derived tools will be used for RR~Lyrae variables observed toward the Galactic bulge.</description>

      <title>On the tension between the Radial Acceleration Relation and Solar System quadrupole in modified gravity MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), postulating a breakdown of Newtonian mechanics at low accelerations, has considerable success at explaining galaxy kinematics. However, the quadrupole of the gravitational field of the Solar System (SS) provides a strong constraint on the way in which Newtonian gravity can be modified. In this paper we assess the extent to which the AQUAL and QUMOND modified gravity formulations of MOND are capable of accounting simultaneously for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), the Cassini measurement of the SS quadrupole and the kinematics of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. We achieve this by inferring the location and sharpness of the MOND transition from the SPARC RAR under broad assumptions for the behaviour of the interpolating function and external field effect. We constrain the same quantities from the SS quadrupole, finding that this requires a significantly sharper transition between the deep-MOND and Newtonian regimes than is allowed by the RAR (an 8.7$\sigma$ tension under fiducial model assumptions). This may be relieved somewhat by allowing additional freedom in galaxies' mass-to-light ratios -- which also improves the RAR fit -- and more significantly (to 1.9$\sigma$) by removing galaxies with bulges. For the first time, we also apply to the SPARC RAR fit an AQUAL correction for flattened systems, obtaining similar results. Finally we show that the SS quadrupole constraint implies, to high precision, no deviation from Newtonian gravity in nearby wide binaries, and speculate on possible resolutions of this tension between SS and galaxy data within the MOND paradigm.</description>

      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. I. Evidence for Disk-Orbit Alignment in the Close Binary FO Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Close binary systems present challenges to planet formation. As binary separations decrease, so too do the occurrence rates of protoplanetary disks in young systems and planets in mature systems. For systems that do retain disks, their disk masses and sizes are altered by the presence of the binary companion. Through the study of protoplanetary disks in binary systems with known orbital parameters, we seek to determine the properties that promote disk retention and, therefore, planet formation. In this work, we characterize the young binary-disk system, FO Tau. We determine the first full orbital solution for the system, finding masses of $0.35^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\ M_\odot$ and $0.34\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ for the stellar components, a semi-major axis of $22(^{+2}_{-1})$ AU, and an eccentricity of $0.21(^{+0.04}_{-0.03})$. With long-baseline ALMA interferometry, we detect 1.3mm continuum and $^{12}{\mathrm{CO}} \ (J=2-1)$ line emission toward each of the binary components; no circumbinary emission is detected. The protoplanetary disks are compact, consistent with being truncated by the binary orbit. The dust disks are unresolved in the image plane and the more extended gas disks are only marginally resolved. Fitting the continuum and CO visibilities, we determine the inclination of each disk, finding evidence for alignment of the disk and binary orbital planes. This study is the first of its kind linking the properties of circumstellar protoplanetary disks to a precisely known binary orbit. In the case of FO Tau, we find a dynamically placid environment (coplanar, low eccentricity), which may foster its potential for planet formation.</description>

Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>
