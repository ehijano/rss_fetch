      <title>STIPP: Space-time in situ postprocessing over the French Alps using proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Space-time in situ postprocessing (STIPP), a machine learning model that generates spatio-temporally consistent weather forecasts for a network of station locations. Gridded forecasts from classical numerical weather prediction or data-driven models often lack the necessary precision due to unresolved local effects. Typical statistical postprocessing methods correct these biases, but often degrade spatio-temporal correlation structures in doing so. Recent works based on generative modeling successfully improve spatial correlation structures but have to forecast every lead time independently. In contrast, STIPP makes joint spatio-temporal forecasts which have increased accuracy for surface temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation when compared to baseline methods. It makes hourly ensemble predictions given only a six-hourly deterministic forecast, blending the boundaries of postprocessing and temporal interpolation. By leveraging a multivariate proper scoring rule for training, STIPP contributes to ongoing work data-driven atmospheric models supervised only with distribution marginals.</description>

      <title>On well-posed energy/entropy stable boundary conditions for the rotating shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and analyze well-posed, energy- and entropy-stable boundary conditions (BCs) for the two-dimensional linear and nonlinear rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) in vector invariant form. The focus of the study is on subcritical flows, which are commonly observed in atmospheric, oceanic, and geostrophic flow applications. We consider spatial domains with smooth boundaries and formulate both linear and nonlinear BCs using mass flux, Riemann's invariants, and Bernoulli's potential, ensuring that the resulting initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is provably entropy- and energy-stable. The linear analysis is comprehensive, providing sufficient conditions to establish the existence, uniqueness, and energy stability of solutions to the linear IBVP. For the nonlinear IBVP, which admits more general solutions, our goal is to develop nonlinear BCs that guarantee entropy stability. We introduce the concepts of linear consistency and linear stability for nonlinear IBVPs, demonstrating that if a nonlinear IBVP is both linearly consistent and linearly stable, then, for sufficiently regular initial and boundary data over a finite time interval, a unique smooth solution exists. Both the linear and nonlinear IBVPs can be efficiently solved using high-order accurate numerical methods. By employing high-order summation-by-parts operators to discretize spatial derivatives and implementing weak enforcement of BCs via penalty techniques, we develop provably energy- and entropy-stable numerical schemes on curvilinear meshes. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy of the methods and to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed BCs and numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal analysis of extreme winter temperatures in Ireland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse extreme daily minimum temperatures in winter months over the island of Ireland from 1950-2022. We model the marginal distributions of extreme winter minima using a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD), capturing temporal and spatial non-stationarities in the parameters of the GPD. We investigate two independent temporal non-stationarities in extreme winter minima. We model the long-term trend in magnitude of extreme winter minima as well as short-term, large fluctuations in magnitude caused by anomalous behaviour of the jet stream. We measure magnitudes of spatial events with a carefully chosen risk function and fit an r-Pareto process to extreme events exceeding a high-risk threshold. Our analysis is based on synoptic data observations courtesy of Met \'Eireann and the Met Office. We show that the frequency of extreme cold winter events is decreasing over the study period. The magnitude of extreme winter events is also decreasing, indicating that winters are warming, and apparently warming at a faster rate than extreme summer temperatures. We also show that extremely cold winter temperatures are warming at a faster rate than non-extreme winter temperatures. We find that a climate model output previously shown to be informative as a covariate for modelling extremely warm summer temperatures is less effective as a covariate for extremely cold winter temperatures. However, we show that the climate model is useful for informing a non-extreme temperature model.</description>

      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here, we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>
