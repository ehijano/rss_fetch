      <title>Primordial Black Holes are 5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit well-established mechanisms for primordial black hole (PBH) production, namely inflation, phase transitions, and cosmic strings, in the context of the Dark Dimension Scenario, which is motivated by Swampland principles. Applying quantum gravity constraints, we demonstrate that any viable mechanism, barring exotic new physics at low energies, inevitably leads to the formation of five-dimensional PBHs. We further show that PBHs formed from cosmic strings can have lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe. We comment on the observational implications of this result, including a potential connection to the recent detection of a high-energy neutrino by KM3NeT, whose energy is intriguingly close to the five-dimensional Planck scale in the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>$B\rightarrow K + \text{axion-like particles}$: effective versus UV-complete models and enhanced two-loop contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An axion-like particle $a$ (ALP) can explain the excess of $B\rightarrow K + \text{invisible}$ events at Belle-II. However, many analyses of ALP scenarios are over-simplified. We revisit the $B\rightarrow K a$ transition rate in a popular minimal and UV complete model with two Higgs doublets (2HDM) and a complex singlet (DFSZ model). To this end we compare our results with previous studies which derived the $\overline{b}sa$ vertex from the $\overline{b}sA$ vertex, where $A$ is the heavy pseudo-scalar of the 2HDM, in terms of an $a-A$ mixing angle. We find this approach to work only at the leading one-loop order, while it fails at the two-loop level. Furthermore, while an approximate $Z_2$ symmetry suppresses the leading-order amplitude by a factor of $1/\tan\beta$, which is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets, we find the two-loop contribution unsuppressed and phenomenologically relevant for $\tan\beta \gtrsim 5$. We determine the allowed parameter space and underline the importance of better searches for $\Upsilon\rightarrow \gamma+$invisible and for a possible excess in $B\rightarrow K\mu^+\mu^-$. We further study the low-energy axion effective theory which leads to a divergent and basis-dependent amplitude. As a conceptual result, we clarify the ambiguities and identify which low-energy framework is consistent with the DFSZ model.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Instability and False Vacuum Decay Induced by Domain Walls in the N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet model (N2HDM) has a rich vacuum structure where multiple electroweak (EW) breaking minima, as well as CP and electric-charge breaking minima, can coexist. These minima can be deeper than the electroweak vacuum $v_{ew} \approx 246\text{ GeV}$ of our universe, making our vacuum metastable. In such a case, one needs to calculate the tunneling rate from the EW vacuum to the deeper minimum. If the lifetime of the EW vacuum is longer than the universe's age, our vacuum is deemed long-lived, and the parameter point is, in principle, allowed. If the decay rate is smaller than the universe's age, then our vacuum is unstable and the parameter point is ruled out. However, domain walls (DW) in the N2HDM can substantially alter this picture. We show in this work that inside the DW, the barrier between our electroweak minimum and the deeper minimum can disappear, leading the scalar fields to classically roll over to the deeper minimum that nucleates inside the DW and then expands outside of it everywhere in the universe. We show that such behavior can happen to parameter points where the lifetime of our minimum is even several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe. Such parameter points with a metastable EW minimum are ruled out.</description>

      <title>Monophotons at Neutrino Experiments from Neutrino Polarizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontrivial electromagnetic properties of neutrinos are an avenue to physics beyond the Standard Model. To this end, we investigate the power of monophoton signals at neutrino experiments to probe a higher-dimensional operator connecting neutrinos to SM photons dubbed, neutrino polarizability. A simplified scenario giving rise to this operator involves a new pseudo-scalar that couples to both neutrinos and photons, with clear implications for axion-like particle (ALP) and Majoron physics. By analyzing the photon energy spectrum and angular distributions, we find that NOMAD and MiniBooNE currently set the most stringent limits, while SBND and the DUNE near detector will soon provide significantly improved constraints.</description>

      <title>Review of heat and charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review field-theoretic studies of charge transport in hot relativistic plasmas under strong magnetic fields and extend the analysis to thermal conductivity. The calculations rely on accurately determining the fermion damping rate. Using the Landau-level representation, these damping rates are computed exactly at leading order and incorporated into the Kubo formula to obtain the thermal and electrical conductivity tensors. Our analysis reveals that the underlying mechanisms of longitudinal and transverse transport differ significantly. Strong magnetic fields markedly suppress transverse transport by confining particles within localized Landau orbits, allowing transport only through quantum transitions between these discrete states. In contrast, longitudinal transport is enhanced, as it primarily depends on the reduced scattering probability of particles moving along the direction of the magnetic field. We also examine the modification of the Wiedemann--Franz law in strongly magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Thermal corrections to Regge trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of Regge trajectories in the context of quantum field theory at finite temperature. For this purpose, we employ the $\lambda \phi^3$ model. We first compute the Regge trajectories at zero temperature, establishing a baseline for comparison. As a key novelty, we extended our analysis to finite temperature and derive an analytical expression for the Regge trajectories in this regime. We explore how temperature modifies the structure of the Regge trajectories and analyze the physical implications of these modifications, which arise from the resummation of thermal ladder diagrams. As an interesting consequence, we find the thermal evolution of masses belonging to different Regge trajectories.</description>

      <title>Thermalization from quantum entanglement: jet simulations in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of thermalization in a quantum field-theoretic model mimicking the production of jets in QCD -- the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. Specifically, we compute the expectation values of local operators as functions of time and compare them to their thermal counterparts, quantify the overlap between the evolving density matrix and the thermal one, and compare the dynamics of the energy-momentum tensor to predictions from relativistic hydrodynamics. Through these studies, we find that the system approaches thermalization at late times and elucidate the mechanisms by which quantum entanglement drives thermalization in closed field-theoretic systems. Our results show how thermodynamic behavior emerges in real time from unitary quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ambiguities in the Partial-Wave Analysis of the Photoproduction of Pairs of Pseudoscalar Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the technique of partial-wave analysis, there are cases where more than one set of underlying complex-valued amplitudes can describe the measured observables. These ambiguities can sometimes be resolved using additional information, but assumptions are often required. It is known that the partial-wave analysis of two-pseudoscalar meson systems produced in photoproduction with a linearly polarized photon beam is free from discrete ambiguities stemming from the Barrelet zeros when the nucleon spin is ignored. In this article, we show that continuous ambiguities are possible for certain wave sets, even though the discrete ambiguities do not appear. We also explore ways to resolve these ambiguities and determine the maximal amount of information that can be obtained from analyses that suffer from these continuous ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Shimmering Darkness: Mapping the Evolution of Supernova-Neutrino-Boosted Dark Matter within the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) has emerged as a promising portal for probing sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we investigate the behavior of BDM signatures originating from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) within the Milky Way (MW) over the past one hundred thousand years, examining both their temporal evolution and present-day spatial distributions. We show that while the MW BDM signature is approximately diffuse in the nonrelativistic regime, it exhibits significant temporal variation and spatial localization when the BDM is relativistic. Importantly, we compare these local MW signatures with the previously proposed diffuse SN$\nu$ BDM (DBDM), which arises from the accumulated flux of all past SNe in the Universe [Y.-H. Lin and M.-R. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 111004 (2024)]. In the nonrelativistic limit, DBDM consistently dominates over the local diffuse MW BDM signature. Only when the MW BDM becomes ultrarelativistic and transitions into a transient, highly-localized signal, it can potentially surpass the DBDM background. This work thus reinforces the importance of DBDM for SN$\nu$ BDM searches until the next galactic SN offers new opportunities.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings in Multi-Step Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic strings arising from a hierarchical gauge symmetry breaking sequence, $\mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \rightarrow \mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \rightarrow \mathrm{U}(1)' \rightarrow \text{Nothing}$. This pattern gives rise to two distinct classes of cosmic strings: light, stable strings formed at a later stage, and heavy, metastable strings originating from an earlier stage. Our focus is on the heavy strings, which may decay either before or after the final $\mathrm{U}(1)'$ symmetry is broken. We analyze the internal structure of these strings and the magnetic flux sourced by monopole-like configurations that emerge at the endpoints of metastable string segments following their decay. Understanding the nature of the magnetic $\mathrm{U}(1)$ fluxes associated with these monopole-like objects is crucial for studying the post-decay evolution of the string network. The post-decay evolution influences the resulting gravitational wave signals. We show that the magnetic flux carried by string segments can be either confined or unconfined, depending on the specific sequence of symmetry breaking and string decay.</description>

      <title>J/$\psi$ and $\Upsilon$(1S) production in jets at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkonia production in hadronic collisions is far from being understood as none of the existing models can correctly describe the wealth of available data. In particular, LHCb and CMS experiments have reported that PYTHIA 8 cannot reproduce the prompt J/$\psi$ production in jets in proton-proton collisions at two different center of mass energies: the event generator predicts an important amount of the prompt J/$\psi$ to be produced isolated, opposite to the experimental data. This document demonstrates that such effect remains true even if the QCD color reconnection (CR) model is used. Besides that, it is shown that using the new quarkonia parton shower included in PYTHIA 8.312 it is possible to correctly describe the experimental results. This agreement between data and simulation is improved when using the QCD color reconnection approach, opening the possibility to distinguish between the two CR implementations. Finally, a prediction performed for $\Upsilon$(1S) indicates that a higher jet p$_T$ selection should be used by the LHC experiments in order to distinguish between PYTHIA 8 results generated with and without the quarkonia parton shower.</description>

      <title>TauSpinner algorithms for including spin and New Physics effects in $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \tau \tau$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to electric and magnetic dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton has brought renewed interest in development of new charge-parity violating signatures in the $\tau$-pair production at Belle II energies, and also at higher energies of the LHC and the FCC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to cross-section and spin correlations in the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^-\tau^+$ production processes, with $\tau$ decays included. Such processes have been observed in the $pp$ and PbPb collisions at CERN LHC experiments. Because of complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighting with studied New Physics phenomena. For the $\gamma\gamma$ processes, extensions of the Standard Model amplitudes are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with electric and magnetic dipole moments in mind, but algorithm can be easily extended to other New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into similar form-factors in the Standard Model structure of matrix elements. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, numerical examples are provided as illustration. Information on how to use the program is given in Appendix of the paper.</description>

      <title>Linearly Polarized Photon Fusion as a Precision Probe of the Tau Lepton Dipole Moments at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ($a_\tau$) and electric dipole moment ($d_\tau$) of the $\tau$ lepton using the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process at future lepton colliders, with the Super Tau-Charm Facility serving as a benchmark. By employing transverse-momentum-dependent factorization, we introduce novel observables derived from $\cos2\phi$, $\sin2\phi$, and $\cos4\phi$ azimuthal asymmetries to precisely probe the $\tau$ lepton's electromagnetic structure. Our analysis significantly enhances the precision of $a_\tau$ constraints, yielding $\mathrm{Re}(a_\tau) \in [-4.5, 6.9] \times 10^{-3}$ at $2\sigma$ confidence level. This represents an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing experimental limits and approaches the precision of the Standard Model prediction. These findings highlight the considerable potential of azimuthal asymmetry measurements for high-precision determinations of fundamental particle properties at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>New Physics Opportunities at Neutrino Facilities: BSM Physics at Accelerator, Atmospheric, and Reactor Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, the long-standing task at hand in particle physics is the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, which accounts for only about 5\% of the Universe.
  In light of this situation, the neutrino sector has drawn significant attention due to neutrino oscillations, which require physics beyond the Standard Model and have prompted a wide array of active and planned experimental programs.
  Notably, neutrino facilities offer substantial potential to search for new physics beyond neutrino oscillations, owing to their precision measurement capabilities, diverse experimental configurations, and various neutrino sources.
  This paper provides a review of the landscape of new physics that can be probed at current and future neutrino experiments, categorized into laboratory-produced and cosmogenic signals.
  We discuss recent experimental results interpreted through the lens of new physics, as well as detailed plans and projected sensitivities of next-generation facilities.
  This review is based on presentations from the 4th Workshop on New Physics Opportunities in Neutrino Facilities (NPN 2024), held at IBS in Daejeon, Korea, on June 3-5, 2024.
  Particular emphasis is placed on accelerator-based neutrino experiments and a range of neutrino programs in East Asia.
  We also outline key tasks necessary to realize the promising new physics opportunities ahead.</description>

Abstract: We construct an equation of state describing cold and dense matter in the core of neutron stars which includes an admixture of fermionic dark matter and incorporates nucleon effective masses derived from the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-body approach within a relativistic mean-field model. Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.</description>

      <title>Three loop master integrals for ${\mathcal{O}} (\alpha \alpha_s^2)$ corrections to quark form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-loop mixed strong-electroweak (${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha \alpha_s^2)$) corrections to the quark form factor. We compute the master integrals which are appearing in the Feynman diagrams containing a single massive boson in the loop. We use the state-of-the-art method of differential equations to compute all 303 of them, expressing the results in terms of generalized polylogarithms. We encounter multiple square roots that cannot be simultaneously rationalized using a single transformation. Applying concurrent transformations allows us to express the results through generalized polylogarithms with a simple alphabet, but with multiple interdependent arguments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic probes revealing the inner structure of the $\Lambda_c(2940)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda_c(2940)$, an open-charm baryon discovered in 2006, has sparked interest due to its ``low mass puzzle'', paralleling the $X(3872)$ in the charmoniumlike sector. Both states challenge conventional hadronic interpretations, with the $X(3872)$ understood as a $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state and the $\Lambda_c(2940)$ hypothesized as a $D^*N$ molecular state. This work investigates the radiative decay modes $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2286)\gamma$, $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2595)\gamma$, and $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2765)\gamma$, analogous to radiative transitions observed in the $X(3872)$. Using the one-boson-exchange model to obtain the $D^*N$ molecular spatial wave function as input, we calculate decay widths and their ratios, finding differences with different quantum number assumptions. Our findings underscore the potential of electromagnetic probes in revealing its nature and highlight the need for dedicated experimental studies to validate these theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Portal to Extra Dimensions: Unified Origin of Dark Radiation, Dark Matter, and Neutrino Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on sterile neutrinos propagating in large extra dimensions (LED) and coupled to a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (Majoron) arising from spontaneous lepton number violation. In this setup, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) sterile neutrino serves as warm dark matter, higher KK modes decay invisibly producing a relativistic Majoron contributing to the effective number of neutrino species (Delta Neff), and active neutrinos undergo invisible decay. This model addresses dark radiation, dark matter, and neutrino anomalies within a minimal, testable framework. We present the Boltzmann evolution of relevant species, identify the viable parameter space, and highlight implications for CMB-S4, Lyman-alpha, and neutrino observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions have been proposed as a primordial black hole (PBH) production mechanism. While previous works rely on simplified models with limited thermodynamic precision, we stress that reliable theoretical PBH predictions require precise nucleation dynamics within realistic, classically conformal extensions of the Standard Model. By employing high-temperature dimensional reduction and computing the one-loop fluctuation determinants, we provide a state-of-the-art thermodynamic analysis and estimate the corresponding PBH abundance for classically conformal gauge-Higgs theories. Accounting for constraints from successful percolation and QCD chiral symmetry breaking, the parameter space where PBHs are viable dark matter candidates is severely limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 50 years after the discovery of the first charmed particle, charm physics continues to be an extremely lively field of research and a cornerstone in particle physics. The study of charm, with its unique properties, is characterised by many challenging but also exciting peculiarities, making it an ideal testing ground for Standard Model (SM) predictions and a very sensitive probe of new physics. This chapter is intended to provide a pedagogical introduction to the physics of the charm quark and to its current theoretical and experimental status. Specifically, it discusses the main features of the charm sector of the SM, the theoretical and experimental challenges that arise when dealing with the charm quark, and the methods used to study it. An overview, both from a theoretical and experimental perspective, of fundamental observables such as lifetimes of charm hadrons, $D^0$-meson mixing, charm charge-parity violation (CPV) and rare charm decays is also presented.</description>

      <title>A covariant description of the interactions of axion-like particles and hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a covariant framework for analyzing the interactions and decay rates of axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to both gluons and quarks. We identify combinations of couplings that are invariant under quark-field redefinitions, and use them to obtain physical expressions for the prominent decay rates of such ALPs, which are compared with previous calculations for scenarios where ALPs couple exclusively to quarks or to gluons. Our framework can be used to obtain ALP decay rates for arbitrary ALP couplings to gluons and quarks across a broad range of ALP masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>Flavor Symmetries and Winding Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular flavor symmetries have been proposed as a new way to address the flavor problem. It is known that they can emerge from string compactifications. We discuss this connection in detail, and show how the congruence subgroups of SL(2,Z), which underlie many modular flavor symmetries, emerge from stringy duality symmetries by orbifolding. This requires an analysis of massive states, which reveals a picture that is more intricate than the well-known situation on the torus. It involves towers of states of different quantum numbers, related by modular transformations. Members of different towers become massless at different points in moduli space. We also show that, at least in the Z_3 orbifold, the string selection rules can be understood as discrete remnants of continuous gauge symmetries. Non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries arise as relics of various, relatively misaligned, continuous Abelian gauge symmetries. The generators of these U(1) symmetries give rise to CP-violating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. If the modulus settles close to a critical point, the corresponding gauge bosons may be light enough to be searched for at future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Abelian gauge field configurations that carry non-zero instanton number. Each such "Abelian instanton" is generated by a closed magnetic worldline in four-dimensional Euclidean space, provided the Abelian gauge field has non-trivial winding along the closed worldline. The resulting field configuration corresponds to a Euclidean dyon loop featuring non-zero instanton number. We embed these dyon loops in a UV-complete theory using the Georgi-Glashow model and show that the full instanton charge is borne entirely by the unbroken $U(1)$ sector. In this same model, using a numerical relaxation procedure, we show that Euclidean dyon loops are a continuous deformation of small BPST instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions at Unusual Values of $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the $\theta$ dependence in a cousin of QCD, where the vacuum structure can be analyzed exactly. The theory is $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_F=0,1,2,3$ flavors of fundamentals, explicitly broken to $\mathcal{N}=1$ via an adjoint superpotential, and coupled to anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB). The hierarchy $m_{AMSB}\ll \mu_{\mathcal{N}=1}\ll \Lambda$ ensures the validity of our IR analysis. As expected from ordinary QCD, the vacuum energy is a function of $\theta$ which undergoes 1st order phase transitions between different vacua where the various dyons condense. For $N_F=0$ we find the expected phase transition at $\theta=\pi$, while for $N_F=1,2,3$ we find phase transitions at fractional values of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of quark effects in nuclei via bremsstrahlung analysis in the proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Background} (1) The incoherent emission of photons is dominant comparing to coherent one in proton-nucleus scattering. The incoherent bremsstrahlung is very sensitive to the magnetic moments of nucleons in nuclei. (2) According to the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, the nucleon magnetic moments in nuclei are enhanced relative to those in vacuum, originating from the quark structure of nucleons. \textbf{Purpose} Investigate possibilities of observing quark effects in nuclei by the analysis of bremsstrahlung in nuclear reactions. \textbf{Methods} Analyse the bremsstrahlung cross sections with established model in proton-nucleus scattering, by extending with inclusion of in-medium modified nucleon magnetic moments in nuclei by the QMC model. \textbf{Results} (1) After calibrating the model without the quark effects for experimental data (TAPS Collaboration data for $p + \isotope[197]{Au}$), we calculate the cross sections and observe the slight difference between the spectra for models with and without quark effects. Such result is found for the first time, confirming possibilities of observing the quark effects in the spectra of bremsstrahlung. (2) As found, quark effects are not enough to be observed in middle and heavy nuclei, as they have dominant incoherent contributions. (3) \isotope[18]{C} has minimal incoherent contribution concerning other carbon isotopes, where the quark effects should be minimal. In ratios between the spectra for \isotope[18]{C} and \isotope[12]{C} with and without the quark effects the difference is clearly observed. \textbf{Conclusions} We establish the new physical observable for the quark effects in nuclei in the bremsstrahlung accompanied in the nuclear reactions, which can be measured. The present suggestion is for the first time in both theoretically and experimentally to study the quark effects in nuclei via the bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Naive parton picture for color transparency of kaon in the electronuclear reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in the kaon-induced nuclear reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$ is investigated in parallel with our previous study on the pion transparency in Phys. Rev. C {\bf111}, 064608 (2025). Based on the Glauber scattering theory, which incorporates shadowing by the two-step process, the kaon color transparency (CT) is analyzed to find that the slope of the kaon CT steeper than the pion CT along with the photon virtuality $Q^2$ increase is well accounted for by the naive parton model (NPM) rather than by the quantum diffusion model (QDM). Further diminishing of CT due to shadowing in the initial state yields better agreement with experimental data. The dependence of kaon transparency on $Q^2$ up to 10 GeV$^2/c^2$ and the mass number $A$ is presented for comparison with the JLab data at the 6 GeV electron beam for the reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$ in $^{12}$C, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>

Abstract: The ECFA Higgs, electroweak, and top Factory Study ran between 2021 and 2025 as a broad effort across the experimental and theoretical particle physics communities, bringing together participants from many different proposed future collider projects. Activities across three main working groups advanced the joint development of tools and analysis techniques, fostered new considerations of detector design and optimisation, and led to a new set of studies resulting in improved projected sensitivities across a wide physics programme. This report demonstrates the significant expansion in the state-of-the-art understanding of the physics potential of future e+e- Higgs, electroweak, and top factories, and has been submitted as input to the 2025 European Strategy for Particle Physics Update.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

      <title>${\mu}$LHC: Antimuon Ring and HL-LHC based ${\mu}^+p$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conceptual design and performance evaluation of HL-LHC based antimuon-proton collider (${\mu}$LHC) are presented. Leveraging the ${\mu}$TRISTAN concept based on established J-PARC ultra-cold ${\mu}^{+}$ beam technology, ${\mu}$LHC will give the opportunity to achieve a 5.3 TeV center-of-mass energy, significantly surpassing EIC and LHeC. Two booster ring options for ${\mu}^{+}$ acceleration, namely, a ${\mu}$TRISTAN-based and a repurposed LHeC ERL-based systems, are explored. Achievable luminosities are predicted to exceed $10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. The ${\mu}$LHC offers substantially wider kinematic plane coverage, particularly in small-x and high-$Q^{2}$ regions, significantly contributing to QCD basics and Higgs boson properties. Its unique potential for BSM physics extends to muon-related phenomena like excited muons, color-octet muons, leptoquarks, and contact interactions. A possible detector concept is also outlined. Given the maturity of ultra-cold ${\mu}^{+}$ beam technology, ${\mu}$LHC is highly feasible for earlier realization than the muon collider, positioning it as a critical tool for the future of high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Confined-deconfined interface tension and latent heat in $\SU{N}$ gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision lattice results for the confined-deconfined interface tension and the latent heat of pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories up to $N=10$ and investigate their asymptotic $N$-dependency. For both quantities we observe the leading $N^2$ behaviour and subleading corrections, with the result for the interface tension $\sigma/T_c^3 = 0.0182(7) N^2 - 0.194(15)$ and for the latent heat $L/T_c^4 = 0.360(6) N^2 - 1.88(17)$. We use the \emph{mixed phase ensemble} method - where the system is constrained so that half of the volume is in the confined phase and the other half in the deconfined phase - and the interface tension is obtained by measuring the capillary wave fluctuation spectra of the interfaces between the two phases. The method bypasses supercritical slowing down from which other methods for determining the interface tension suffer, and as a by-product produces accurate estimates of the critical inverse gauge coupling as a function of the inverse temperature. We use the latter to determine the lattice beta function values, required to compute the latent heat from the discontinuity in the average plaquette action across the confined-deconfined transition.</description>

      <title>Soft Factorisation and Exponentiation from Schwinger-Space Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared divergences in Quantum Field Theory govern the low-energy dynamics of many physical theories, and their understanding is a crucial ingredient in predicting the outcomes of collider experiments. We present a novel approach to deriving the structure of these divergences by employing the Schwinger parametrization of Feynman integrals. After using tropical geometry to identify divergent limits, we study the all-orders asymptotic properties of Feynman diagrams via matrix manipulations of graph Laplacians, which allows us to analyse their IR behaviour systematically. We explicitly demonstrate the soft-hard factorization of the integrand for a broad class of diagrams, and reveal that when written in terms of "worldline distances", topologically distinct diagrams asymptote to the same integrand. In particular, for the case of Quantum Electrodynamics, we use this fact to show how ladder-type diagrams combine in Schwinger-parameter space to yield the correct exponentiated soft anomalous dimension. This framework provides a foundation for extending these methods to more complex theories like Quantum Chromodynamics and offers a pathway towards a systematic understanding of infrared divergences in perturbative amplitudes.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop penguin contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of four-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Next-to-Leading Order (two-loop) contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of $\Delta F = 1$ four-quark operators in QCD. We devise a test for anomalous dimensions, that we regard as of general interest, and by means of which we detect a problem in the results available in the literature. Deconstructing the steps leading to the available result, we identify the source of the problem, which is related to the operator known as $Q_{11}$. We show how to fix the problem and provide the corrected anomalous dimensions. With the insight of our findings, we propose an alternative approach to the one used in the literature which does not suffer from the identified disease, and which confirms our corrected results. We assess the numerical impact of our corrections, which happens to be in the ballpark of $5\%$ in certain entries of the evolution matrix. Our results are important for the correct resummation of Next-to-Leading Logarithms in analyses of physics beyond the Standard Model in $\Delta F = 1$ processes, such as the decays of Kaons and $B$-mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of QCD phase transitions on the quark spin fluctuations and correlations. We propose the quark-antiquark correlation, which relates to the vector meson spin alignment and the $\Lambda-\bar\Lambda$ correlation, can be used as a novel probe of the critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram. Using the Nambu-Jona-Lanisio model, we qualitatively study the properties of quark-antiquark spin correlations. Our findings reveal a peak structure near the CEP of the chiral phase transition, which may serve as an experimental signature of the CEP and account for the non-monotonic behavior of $\phi$ meson alignment at low collision energies observed recently in experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the near-side ridge structure in pp collisions via Momentum-Kick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The near-side ridge structure has been observed in the long-range two-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions, such as AuAu collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider(RHIC) and PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Hydrodynamic models have successfully explained the ridge structure in heavy-ion collisions, indicating the presence of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Interestingly, similar ridge structures have been detected in high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, which are classified as small systems in the LHC experiments. Because small systems have been considered insufficient to generate QGP, the applicability of theories developed for heavy-ion collisions to small systems remains controversial. Assuming that kinematic effects play a more significant role in small systems, we expect that the Momentum-Kick Model (MKM) can provide a satisfactory explanation. This model elucidates the long-range and near-side ridge structure in dihadron $\Delta\eta-\Delta\phi$ correlation by explaining that jet particles kick and rearrange medium partons along the direction of the jets. In this study, we apply the MKM to explain high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at both 13 TeV and 7 TeV in the LHC over various ranges of momenta. Furthermore, we introduce multiplicity dependence in the model to account for the 13 TeV data at various multiplicity ranges. We conclude that the MKM effectively explains the near-side ridge structure observed in proton-proton collisions. The LHC has entered Run 3, achieving higher center-of-mass energies and better luminosity than Run 2. We offer $\Delta\phi$ correlation predictions for pp collisions at 14 TeV and suggest possible extensions of the MKM for future studies.</description>

      <title>Darkonia at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter may form bound states in a dark sector with an attractive force between two dark matter particles. Searches for dark matter at colliders can differ dramatically from routine searches if bound states, dubbed darkonia, are produced and decay into visible Standard-Model particles. In this work, we use three representative models with scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector force carriers to map out the darkonium signatures at both high-energy and low-energy colliders. Some of the bound states can be stable due to generalized parity and charge-conjugation symmetries, while others decay into light dark-force carriers, which subsequently can decay at a displaced vertex. New signatures with a mix of missing energy and multiple di-lepton or di-jet vertices reconstructing intermediate darkonium resonances are within reach at the LHC and Belle II.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the $\Xi_c$ baryon electromagnetic decay widths within the constituent quark model formalism through an analysis of the transitions from $P-$wave states to ground states. We use the non-relativistic limit of the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction on keeping all the terms up to the order $m_j^{-1}$. We calculate the electromagnetic decay widths analytically, for the first time, without any further approximation. Specifically, our theoretical results for the $\Xi_c(2790)^{+/0}$ and $\Xi_c(2815)^{+/0}$ radiative decay widths, without the introduction of any additional parameters, display a significant agreement with the recent experimental values obtained by the Belle experiment. The agreement is due to the fact that we have not introduced further approximation to simplify the calculation of the difficult convective term, unlike what was done in previous studies. Our predictions may be useful for future experiments at the Belle, BABAR, and LHC experiments.</description>

      <title>Unitarity triangle angles explained: a predictive new quark mass matrix texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quark mass matrix texture-pair with five free parameters, which fits the four quark mass ratios $m_s/m_b$, $m_d/m_b$, $m_c/m_t$, $m_u/m_t$, and the four CKM quark mixing observables. The matrices each have one texture zero, but the main innovation here is a ``geometric'' ansatz exploiting a pair of small complex expansion parameters, based on the geometry of the Unitarity Triangle. The fit to the observables is in good agreement with current experimental values renormalised to $\sim\!\!10^4$ TeV, and offers decisive tests against future high-precision measurements of the unitarity triangle angles at the weak scale. We identify two novel symmetries of these mass matrices which explain the phenomenologically-successful relations $\alpha\equiv\phi_2\simeq\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ and $\beta\equiv\phi_1\simeq\tfrac{\pi}{8}$.</description>

      <title>Mono-lepton Signature of a Neutrino-philic Dark Fermion at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter at high-energy colliders and direct detection experiments can effectively cover nearly the entire mass range from the MeV to the TeV scale. In this paper, we focus on four-fermion contact interactions formulated within the framework of Effective Field Theory. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of mono-lepton production at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that tensor operators exhibit superior sensitivity in the mono-lepton channel, constraining energy scales up to 3\,TeV for a nearly massless dark fermion using current LHC data. Moreover, these operators mediate both spin-independent and spin-dependent absorption processes in nuclear targets. A systematic comparison of constraints between direct detection experiments and collider measurements reveals the LHC's distinct advantage in exploring sub-GeV dark matter candidates while maintaining competitive sensitivity at the TeV scale. Notably, direct detection experiments such as Super-Kamiokande and Borexino achieve complementary constraints in the 10-100\,TeV mass range through their unique capabilities: utilization of light nuclei targets, large exposure volumes, and distinctive features of the recoil energy spectra.</description>

      <title>$\eta_c$ leading-twist distribution amplitude and the $B_c \to \eta_c\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ semileptonic decays using QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semileptonic decays $B_c \to \eta_c\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ using the quantum chromodynamics(QCD) sum rules within the framework of Standard Model (SM). We further explore the potential to probe signatures of new Physics (NP) beyond the SM through these decays. First, we derive the $\xi$-moments $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{n}\rangle$ of the $\eta_c$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;\eta_c}$ using the QCD sum rules within the background field theory. Considering contributions from the vacuum condensates up to dimension-six, the first two nonzero $\xi$-moments at the scale of $4$ GeV are found to be $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{2}\rangle = 0.103^{+0.009}_{-0.009}$ and $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{4}\rangle = 0.031^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$. Using these moments, we then fix the Gegenbauer expansion series of $\phi_{2;\eta_c}$ and apply it to compute the $B_c \to \eta_c$ transition form factors (TFFs) using QCD light cone sum rules. Second, we extrapolate those TFFs to physically allowable $q^2$-range via a simplified series expansion, and we obtain $R_{\eta_c}|_{\rm SM} = 0.308^{+0.084}_{-0.062}$. Furthermore, we explore the potential impacts of various NP scenarios on $R_{\eta_c}$. Specifically, we compute the forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm FB}({q^2})$, the convexity parameter $\mathcal{C}_F^\tau ({q^2})$, and the longitudinal and transverse polarizations $\mathcal{P}_L ({q^2})$ and $\mathcal{P}_T ({q^2})$ for $B_c \to \eta_c$ transitions within both the SM and two types of NP scenarios. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of $B_c$-meson semileptonic decays and provide insights into the search for the NP beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Non-Renormalizable SU(5) GUTs: Leptoquark-Induced Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the doublet-triplet splitting problem within the $SU(5)$ gauge group framework to advocate a viable regime with the light scalar leptoquark of the doublet-triplet splitting notoriety that is compatible with the current experimental bounds on partial proton decay lifetimes. We explicitly demonstrate, through a consistent use of higher-dimensional operators, how to implement suppression of baryon number violating interactions of the aforementioned color triplet. Our study thus offers an alternative approach to the doublet-triplet splitting problem as it removes a need for an extreme mass hierarchy between the partners residing in the same representation. We furthermore pursue two different extensions of two distinct symmetry breaking scenarios of $SU(5)$, one with a $24$-dimensional representation and the other one with a $75$-dimensional representation, to produce comparative study of novel consequences for the gauge coupling unification and the one-loop level neutrino mass generation. Our results point towards qualitatively novel $SU(5)$ scenarios, where the light scalar leptoquarks, responsible for the neutrino mass generation, might be even accessible at colliders and thus serve as an accelerator accessible portal to the high-scale physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limits on lepton radii and contact interaction scales are used to derive limits on the deviations of lepton anomalous magnetic dipole moments (g-2)/2 from the Standard Model predictions. In the case of quadratic dependence of the deviations on the lepton mass the limits for electrons are better compared to low energy measurements, for muons somewhat weaker than the latest precision experiments, and for taus by far the best.</description>

      <title>2024 TASI Lectures: A Dark Matter Primer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are based on a sequence of 4 lectures delivered at the 2024 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) and at the Universit\`a degli Studi di Padova. They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties. This is followed by an overview of several canonical mechanisms for the production of cosmological dark matter, and a concluding section that surveys current experimental and observational efforts to detect it with a focus on direct detection.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived dark scalars at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the search for long-lived dark scalars from exotic Higgs boson decays at the Future Circular Collider in its $e^+e^-$ stage, FCC-ee, considering an integrated luminosity of 10.8 $\text{ab}^{-1}$ collected during the ZH run at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV. The work considers $Zh$ events where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson $h$ decays into two long-lived dark scalars $s$ which further decay into bottom anti-bottom quark pairs. The analysis is performed using a parametrized simulation of the IDEA detector concept and targets dark scalar decays in the tracking volume, resulting in multiple displaced vertices in the final state. The sensitivity towards long-lived dark scalars at FCC-ee is estimated using an event selection requiring two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons compatible with the $Z$ boson, and at least two displaced vertices in the final state. The selection is seen to efficiently remove the Standard Model background, while retaining sensitivity for dark scalar masses between $m_s=20$ GeV and $m_s=60$ GeV and mean proper lifetimes $c\tau$ between approximately 10 mm and 10 m The results show that the search strategy has potential to probe Higgs to dark scalar branching ratios as low as $10^{-4}$ for a mean proper lifetime $c\tau\approx 1$ m. The results provide the first sensitivity estimate for exotic Higgs decays at FCC-ee with the IDEA detector concept, using the common FCC framework.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton polarization and dynamics of the QCD plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of the polarization of lepton pairs produced in $\sqrts = 5.02 $ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, using next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rates. These calculations employ a multi-stage framework to simulate the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to explore the sensitivity of polarization to early times. It is found that the intermediate invariant-mass dileptons are indeed probes of the thermal equilibration process, and go beyond the reach of hadronic observables. We compute the polarization anisotropy coefficient obtained with LO dilepton rates, and show that the LO and NLO results differ radically, both in trend and in magnitude, at low and intermediate lepton pair invariant masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of a light beta-radioactive ion using a compact ion trap by adapting the "frozen-spin" method. The measurement will be done on ions stripped of their valence electrons, thereby bypassing the significant Schiff screening that hinders the application of successful contemporary EDM searches using heavy neutral atoms and molecules to light nuclei. We identified $^8$Li as the most promising candidate for a proof-of-concept EDM search and we estimate that the current indirect proton EDM limit of a few $10^{-25} e\cdot$cm set by $^{199}$Hg measurements can be surpassed with a week of measurement time at existing facilities.</description>
