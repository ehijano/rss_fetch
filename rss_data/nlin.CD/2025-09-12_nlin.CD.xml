      <title>Intermittent chaos in an optomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Turbulent Transport in Decaying 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on the transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. Turbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves through nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent structures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial vorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively distinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle trajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian framework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such as absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and velocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily governed by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing fraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of behaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between anisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing, flow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated by the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also influenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping rotational motion and random walks, and L\'evy flight-like events. These findings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from laboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical structures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Conditioning on PDE Parameters to Generalise Deep Learning Emulation of Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes. We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification, allowing for the statistical study of rare events.</description>

      <title>History-Dependent Dynamical Invariants in the Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to the established view of the Lorenz system as an archetype of dissipative chaos lacking conserved quantities, this work rigorously demonstrates the existence of a novel class of history-dependent dynamical invariants. Through a constructive method that augments the phase space, we derive a non-local invariant whose value remains constant along any trajectory. Its history-dependence arises from an integral term that accumulates the orbit's past, thereby ensuring its conservation. The invariant's constancy is verified with high-precision numerical simulations for both periodic and chaotic orbits. This finding reveals a hidden structure within the attractor and affords a new physical interpretation where unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) correspond to specific values of this conserved quantity. The result redefines the notion of non-integrability in dissipative systems, showing that non-local order can coexist with chaotic behavior.</description>
