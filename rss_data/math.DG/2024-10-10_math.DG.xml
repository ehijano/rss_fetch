      <title>Metric Lie Groups. Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces from the homogeneous viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book explores geometries defined by left-invariant distance functions on Lie groups, with a particular focus on nilpotent groups and Carnot groups equipped with geodesic distances. Geodesic left-invariant metrics are either sub-Riemannian or their generalizations, known as sub-Finsler geometries or Carnot-Carath\'eodory metrics. The primary objective is to illustrate how these non-smooth geometries, together with a Lie group structure, manifest in various mathematical fields, including metric geometry and geometric group theory.
  Additionally, the book demonstrates the role of metric Lie groups, particularly Carnot groups, in the following contexts:
  (a) as asymptotic cones of nilpotent groups;
  (b) as parabolic boundaries of rank-one symmetric spaces and, more broadly, of homogeneous negatively curved Riemannian manifolds;
  (c) as limits of Riemannian manifolds and tangents of sub-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the drift Laplacian on Ricci expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the drift Laplacian on Ricci expanders. We show that the spectrum is discrete when the potential function is proper, and we show that the hypothesis on the properness of the potential function cannot be removed. We also extend previous results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the potential function on Ricci expanders. This allows us to conclude that the drift Laplacian has discrete spectrum on Ricci expanders whose Ricci curvature is bounded below by a suitable constant, possibly negative. Further, we compute all the eigenvalues of the drift Laplacian on rigid expanders and rigid shrinkers. Lastly, we investigate the second eigenvalue of the drift Laplacian on rigid Ricci expanders whose Einstein factor is a closed hyperbolic Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>A note on the magnetic Steklov operator on functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Steklov eigenvalue problem on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary for generic magnetic potentials and establish various results concerning the spectrum. We show a Shikegawa type gauge-equivalence for the magnetic Steklov operator and study bounds for the smallest eigenvalue. We prove a Cheeger-Jammes type lower bound for the first eigenvalue by introducing magnetic Cheeger constants that involve the notion of frustration index of domains. We also obtain an analogue of an upper bound for the first magnetic Neumann eigenvalue due to Colbois, El Soufi, Ilias and Savo. In addition, we compute the full spectrum in the case of the Euclidean $2$-ball and $4$-ball for a particular choice of magnetic potential given by Killing vector fields, and discuss the behavior. Finally, we establish a comparison result for the magnetic Steklov operator associated with the manifold and the square root of the magnetic Laplacian on the boundary, which generalises the uniform geometric upper bounds for the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues in the non-magnetic case due to Colbois, Girouard and Hassannezhad.</description>

      <title>Elliptic domains in Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element $g$ of a Lie group is called stably elliptic if it is contained in the interior of the set $G^e$ of elliptic elements, characterized by the property that $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ generates a relatively compact subgroup. Stably elliptic elements appear naturally in the geometry of causal symmetric spaces and in representation theory. We characterize stably elliptic elements in terms of the fixed point algebra of $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ and show that the connected components of the set $G^{se}$ of stably elliptic elements can be described in terms of the Weyl group action on a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra. In the case of simple hermitian Lie groups we relate stably elliptic elements to maximal invariant cones and the associated subsemigroups. In particular we show that the basic connected component $G^{se}(0)$ can be characterized in terms of the compactness of order intervals and that $G^{se}(0)$ is globally hyperbolic with respect to the induced biinvariant causal structure.</description>

      <title>Existence and unicity of pluriharmonic maps to Euclidean buildings and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex smooth quasi-projective variety $X$, a reductive algebraic group $G$ defined over some non-archimedean local field $K$ and a Zariski dense representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to G(K)$, we construct a $\varrho$-equivariant pluriharmonic map from the universal cover of $X$ into the Bruhat-Tits building $\Delta(G)$ of $G$, with appropriate asymptotic behavior. We also establish the uniqueness of such a pluriharmonic map in a suitable sense, and provide a geometric characterization of these equivariant maps. This paper builds upon and extends previous work by the authors jointly with G. Daskalopoulos and D. Brotbek.</description>

      <title>A note on the symplectic classification of almost-toric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since simple semitoric systems were classified about fifteen years ago, and semitoric systems five years ago, we want to move a step forward to almost-toric systems. We give a classification of compact almost-toric systems in dimension four up to fiber-preserving symplectomorphisms, in terms of the base, Taylor series, and twisting indices, analogous to the five invariants for semitoric systems. For convenience, we specify an ordering of focus-focus values and a choice of two cut rays at each of them.</description>

      <title>Local superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of proper and cocompact actions on reductive homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a noncompact connected real reductive linear Lie group, then any discrete subgroup of $G$ acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on some homogeneous space $G/H$ of $G$ is quasi-isometrically embedded and sharp for $G/H$, i.e. satisfies a strong, quantitative form of proper discontinuity. For noncompact reductive $H$, this was known as the Sharpness Conjecture, with applications to spectral analysis on pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces developed in arXiv:1209.4075. For $G/H$ rational of real corank one, we use sharpness to fully characterize properly discontinuous and cocompact actions on $G/H$ in terms of Anosov representations. This enables us to show that in real corank one, acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on $G/H$ is an open property, and also to prove that a number of homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})/\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ for $n&gt;1$ and $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or the quaternions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of embedded non planar free boundary minimal disks into rotationally symmetric ellipsoids of $\mathbb{R}^3$. The construction relies on the optimization of combinations of first and second Steklov eigenvalues renormalized by the length of the boundary, among metrics on the disk. We also prove that non planar free boundary harmonic maps from a disk into a ellipsoid of $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the coordinate functions are first or second Steklov eigenfunctions with respect to the associated critical metric is a minimal immersion (without branched points) and that if the critical metric is even with respect to the coordinates of the disk, then the minimal immersion is an embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the curvature of Eschenburg spaces with respect to two different metrics, one constructed by Eschenburg and the other by Wilking. With respect to the Eschenburg metric, we obtain a simple complete characterization of the curvature of every Eschenburg space in terms of the triples of integers defining the space. With respect to Wilking's metric, we study all the examples whose natural isometry group acts with cohomogeneity two. Here, we find that apart from the previously known examples with almost positive curvature, all the remaining examples have open sets of points with zero-curvature planes.</description>

      <title>Zero-curvature subconformal structures and dispersionless integrability in dimension five</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recent paradigm "Integrability via Geometry" from dimensions 3 and 4 to higher dimensions, relating dispersionless integrability of partial differential equations to curvature constraints of the background geometry. We observe that in higher dimensions on any solution manifold the symbol defines a vector distribution equipped with a subconformal structure, and the integrability imposes a certain compatibility between them.
  In dimension 5 we express dispersionless integrability via the vanishing of a certain curvature of this subconformal structure. We also obtain a "master equation" governing all second order dispersionless integrable equations in 5D, and count their functional dimension.
  It turns out that the obtained background geometry is parabolic of the type $(A_3,P_{13})$. We provide its Cartan theoretic description and compute the harmonic curvature components via the Kostant theorem. Then we relate it to 3D projective and 4D conformal geometries via twistor theory, discuss symmetry reductions and nested Lax sequences, as well as give another interpretation of dispersionless integrability in 5D through Levi-degenerate CR structures~in~7D.</description>

Abstract: Geometry of manifolds with positive sectional curvature has been a central object dates back to the beginning of Riemannian geometry. Up to homeomorphism, there are only finitely many examples of simply connected positively curved manifolds in all dimensions except in dimension 7 and 13, namely, the Aloff-Wallach spaces and the Eschenburg spaces in dimension 7, and the Bazaikin spaces in dimension 13. The topological classification modelled on the 7-dimensional examples has been carried out by Kreck-Stolz which leads to a complete topological classification for the Aloff-Wallach spaces. The main goal of this paper is to provide the topological classification of 13-dimensional manifolds modelled on the Bazaikin spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the scattering rigidity problem in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation known on a lateral timelike boundary. We show that one can recover the jet of the metric up to a gauge transformation near a lightlike strictly convex point. Assuming that the metric is real analytic, we show that one can recover the metric up to a gauge transformation as well near such a point.</description>

      <title>Critical domains for certain Dirichlet integrals in weighted manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start by revisiting the derivation of the variational formulae for the functional assigning to a bounded regular domain in a Riemannian manifold its first Dirichlet eigenvalue and extend it to (not necessarily bounded) domains in certain weighted manifolds. This is further extended to other functionals defined by certain Dirichlet energy integrals, with a Morse index formula for the corresponding critical domains being established. We complement these infinitesimal results by proving a couple of global rigidity theorems for (possibly critical) domains in Gaussian half-space, including an Alexandrov-type soap bubble theorem. Although we provide direct proofs of these latter results, we find it worthwhile to point out that the main tools employed (specifically, certain Pohozhaev and Reilly identities) can be formally understood as limits (when the dimension goes to infinity) of tools previously established by Ciarolo-Vezzoni and Qiu-Xia to handle similar problems in round hemispheres, with the notion of "convergence" of weighted manifolds being loosely inspired by the celebrated Poincar\'e's limit theorem in the theory of Gaussian random vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we classify rotationally symmetric conformally flat admissible solitons to the $k$-Yamabe flow, a fully non-linear version of the Yamabe flow. For $n\geq 2k$ we prove existence of complete expanding, steady and shrinking solitons and describe their asymptotic behavior at infinity. For $n&lt;2k$ we prove that steady and expanding solitons are not admissible. The proof is based on the careful analysis of an associated dynamical system.</description>

      <title>A variational method for functionals depending on eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic variational method for functionals depending on eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds. It is based on a new concept of Palais Smale sequences that can be constructed thanks to a generalization of classical min-max methods on $C^1$ functionals to locally-Lipschitz functionals. We prove convergence results on these Palais-Smale sequences emerging from combinations of Laplace eigenvalues or combinations of Steklov eigenvalues in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>A mean field problem approach for the double curvature prescription problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a new mean field-type formulation to study the problem of prescribing Gaussian and geodesic curvatures on compact surfaces with boundary, which is equivalent to the following Liouville-type PDE with nonlinear Neumann conditions: $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u+2K_g=2Ke^u&amp;\text{in }\Sigma\\ \partial_\nu u+2h_g=2he^\frac u2&amp;\text{on }\partial\Sigma. \end{array}\right.$$ We provide three different existence results in the cases of positive, zero and negative Euler characteristics by means of variational techniques.</description>

      <title>On the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds which are like a coadjoint orbit of $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$ with a Hamiltionan circle action. Then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. Motivated by recent works on the case that the fixed point set consists of precisely $n+1$ isolated points, this paper studies a Hamiltonian $S^1$ action on a $10$-dimensional compact symplectic manifold with exactly 6 isolated fixed points. We study the relations of the following data: the first Chern class of the manifold,the largest weight of the action, all the weights of the action, the total Chern class of the manifold, and the integral cohomology ring of the manifold. We show the similarities of these data with those of a coadjoint orbit of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a subcircle of the maximal torus.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{C^2}$-Lusin approximation of strongly convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, if $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a locally strongly convex body (not necessarily compact), then for any open set $V \supset \partial W$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $V \supset \partial W$ is open, then there exists a $C^2$ locally strongly convex body $W_{\varepsilon, V}$ such that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial W_{\varepsilon, V}\triangle\,\partial W)&lt;\varepsilon$ and $\partial W_{\varepsilon, V}\subset V$. Moreover, if $W$ is strongly convex, then $W_{\varepsilon, V}$ is strongly convex as well.</description>
