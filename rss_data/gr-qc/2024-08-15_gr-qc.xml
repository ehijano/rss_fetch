      <title>Canonical analysis of linearized $\lambda R$ gravity plus a Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian analysis for the linearized $\lambda R$ gravity plus a Chern-Simons term is performed. The first-class and second-class constraints for arbitrary values of $\lambda$ are presented, and one physical degree of freedom is reported. The second-class constraints are removed, and the corresponding generalized Dirac brackets are constructed; then, the difference between theories with different values of $\lambda$ is remarked.</description>

      <title>Kundt Gravitational Waves Coupled with a Non-Noetherian Conformal Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type N spacetimes of the Kundt class are presented as solutions to the Einstein's equations sourced by a real scalar field whose equation of motion is conformally invariant and that generalizes the standard conformal scalar field. The specific spacetimes considered model gravitational waves with uniform and totally geodesic wave fronts, propagating in a maximally symmetric background, and are characterized by the value of their constant scalar curvature and by the so-called wave profile function. All subclasses of such spacetimes are analyzed. It is shown that the scalar field solutions generically divide into two branches, of which one has a strikingly different behavior from that of the standard conformal case. The scalar field contributes to the equation satisfied by the wave profile function by adding new singular terms. Closed form and mode solutions for the wave profile function are found for different scenarios. The resulting energy-momentum tensor has a null eigenvector, but is more general than the pure radiation type usually coupled with this kind of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Properties of dynamical regular black holes in semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes have become a popular alternative to the singular mathematical black holes predicted by general relativity as they circumvent mathematical pathologies associated with the singularity while preserving crucial black hole features such as the trapping of light. Based on the assumption that semiclassical gravity is valid in the vicinity of their apparent horizons, we review their thermodynamic properties in static scenarios and demonstrate that 1-loop corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, accounting for the entanglement entropy of fields, depend on the regularization scheme used. Taking backreaction effects into consideration, we investigate their full dynamical evolution and we examine the behavior of the null energy condition. We find that it is always violated in the vicinity of the outer horizon while being satisfied in the vicinity of the inner horizon, which implies that the trapped spacetime region, as determined from the behavior of null geodesic congruences, is effectively separated into a null energy condition-violating and a non-violating domain. Our findings suggest that quantum effects are more dominant close to the outer apparent horizon and become more pronounced towards the final stages of the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Traversable Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07350v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the observational signatures of traversable Simpson-Visser wormholes illuminated by luminous celestial spheres and orbiting hot spots. We demonstrate that when light sources and observers are on the same side of the wormholes, the images of the wormholes mimic those of black holes. However, when the light sources are positioned on the opposite side from observers, photons traversing the wormhole throat generate distinct observational signatures. Specifically, unlike black hole images, the wormhole images are confined within the critical curve, resulting in smaller centroid variations. Furthermore, the light curve of hot spots can exhibit additional peaks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational odd-parity perturbation of a Horndeski hairy black hole: quasinormal mode and parameter constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the binary black hole coalescence, the gravitational wave emitted at the ringdown stage can be well described within the black hole perturbation theory, where the quasinormal modes (QNMs) become the important ingredient in modeling the pattern wave form. In general ralativity (GR), the QNMs can be obtained from solving the Regge-Wheeler equation in static black hole, while in Horndeski gravity, the metric perturbation equation can be simplified into a modified Regge-Wheeler equation from the perturbed action. In this paper, we calculate the QNMs frequencies of the gravitational odd-parity perturbation of a specific hairy black hole in Horndeski gravity with the use of the matrix method and pseudo spectral method. Our results indicate that such a Horndeski hairy black hole is stable under the odd perturbation, which is also verified by the time evolution of the perturbation. In particular, we find that for a certain range of the Horndeski hair, the $\ell&gt;2$ modes become the long-lived mode instead of $\ell=2$ mode in GR. Then, we use the ringdown QNMs to preliminarily investigate the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) rescaled measurement error of the Horndeski hair. We obtained significant effects of the angular momentum and overtone on the error bound of the hairy parameter. We hope that our findings could inspire more theoretical and phenomenal work on the test of no-hair theorem of black hole from gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of cosmographic expansions in Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmographic expansions of the luminosity distance for a variety of Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models which we specify inspired by local large-scale structures of the universe. We consider cosmographic expansions valid for general spacetimes and compare to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) limit of the expansions as well as to its naive isotropic extrapolation to an inhomogeneous universe. The FLRW expansions are often poor near the observer but become better at higher redshifts, where the light rays have reached the FLRW background. In line with this we find that the effective Hubble, deceleration and jerk parameters of the general cosmographic expansion are often very different from the global $\Lambda$CDM values, with deviations up to several orders of magnitude. By comparing with the naive isotropic extrapolation of the FLRW expansion, we assess that these large deviations are mainly due to anisotropy. Very close to the observer, the general cosmographic expansion is always best and becomes more precise when more expansion terms are included. However, we find that the convergence radius of the general cosmographic expansion is small for all studied models and observers and the general cosmographic expansion becomes poor for several observers already before a single LTB structure has been traversed. The small radius of convergence of the general cosmographic expansion has also been indicated by earlier work and may need careful attention before we can safely apply the general cosmographic expansion to real data.</description>

      <title>New Horizons for Psi: Studying fundamental fields with numerical relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This set of notes was designed to accompany two hours of lectures and practical exercises at the New Horizons for Psi workshop in Lisbon in July 2024 entitled "Studying fundamental fields with numerical relativity". Numerical relativity is a tool used to help understand the behaviours of metric and matter fields in dynamical, strong gravity situations. It has been used to study a range of situations involving fundamental fields, including superradiance, modified gravity, dynamical friction, dark matter accretion and early universe cosmology. The purpose of this course is to provide some background and hands-on experience in numerical relativity that will help students to better understand the possibilities provided by this tool, as well as its limitations.</description>

      <title>Possible wormholes in $f(R)$ gravity sourced by solitonic quantum wave and cold dark matter halos and their repulsive gravity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new generalized wormhole (WH) solutions within the context of $f(R)$ gravity. Specifically, we focus on $f(R)$ gravitational theories formulated in the metric formalism, with our investigation centered on a power-law form represented by $f(R) = \epsilon R^{\chi}$. Here, $\epsilon$ is an arbitrary constant, and $\chi$ is a real number. Notably, this form possesses the advantageous property of reducing to Einstein gravity when $\epsilon=1$ and $\chi=1$. To obtain these novel WH solutions, we establish the general field equations for any $f(R)$ theory within the framework of Morris-Thorne spacetime, assuming metric coefficients that are independent of time. By utilizing an anisotropic matter source and a specific type of energy density associated with solitonic quantum wave (SQW) and cold dark matter (CDM) halos, we calculate two distinct WH solutions. We thoroughly investigate the properties of the exotic matter (ExoM) residing within the WH geometry and analyze the matter contents through energy conditions (ECs). Both analytical and graphical methods are employed in this analysis to examine the validity of different regions. Notably, the calculated shape functions for the WH geometry satisfy the necessary conditions in both scenarios, emphasizing their reliability. This ExoM is characterized by an energy-momentum tensor that violates the null energy condition (NEC) and, consequently, the weak energy condition as well, in the vicinity of the WH throats. Furthermore, we investigated the repulsive effect of gravity and discovered that its presence results in a negative deflection angle for photons following null geodesics. Importantly, we observed that the deflection angle consistently exhibits negative values across all $r_0$ values in both scenarios, indicating the manifestation of the repulsive gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in the generalized SU(2) Proca theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized SU(2) Proca theory is a vector-tensor modified gravity theory characterized by an action that remains invariant under both diffeomorphisms and global internal transformations of the SU(2) group. This study aims to further explore the physical properties of the theory within astrophysical contexts. Previous investigations have unveiled intriguing astrophysical solutions, including particle-like configurations and black holes. The purpose of this work is to constrain the theory's free parameters by modeling realistic neutron stars. To that end, we have assumed solutions that are static, spherically symmetric, and have adopted the t'Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole configuration for the vector fields. Employing both analytical techniques, such as asymptotic expansions, and numerical methods involving solving boundary value problems, we have obtained neutron star solutions whose baryonic matter is described by realistic equations of state for nuclear matter. Furthermore, we have constructed mass-radius relations which reveal that neutron stars exhibit greater compactness in comparison with general relativity predictions for most of the solutions we have found and for the employed equations of state. Finally, we have found out solutions where the mass of the star is greater than $\sim$ 2.5 $M_\odot$; this result poses an alternative in the exploration of the mass gap of compact stellar objects.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical Weyl gauge boson and is Weyl-anomaly free; all fields and masses have geometric origin, with no added scalar compensators; the theory is the leading order of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry that gives a natural analytical continuation of the former to $d$ dimensions; Weyl anomaly is recovered in the broken phase; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in Weyl conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry alone generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian system is a class of non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian satisfying the condition $\eta^{-1}H^\dagger\eta=H$. We develop the in-in and Schwinger Keldysh formalism to calculate cosmological correlators for pseudo-Hermitian systems. We study a model consists of massive symplectic fermions coupled to the primordial curvature perturbation. The three-point function for the primordial curvature perturbation is computed up to one-loop and compared to earlier work where the loop correction comes from a massive scalar boson. The two results differ by a minus sign. Therefore, the one loop correction to the three-point function cannot be used to distinguished scalar bosons and symplectic fermions. To conclude, we discuss possibilities where the scalar bosons and symplectic fermions may be distinguished.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls using fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider two different scenarios: first, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic three-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls during head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regards to stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are classically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With regards to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on many different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.</description>

Abstract: The Newman-Janis algorithm, which involves complex-coordinate transformations, establishes connections between static and spherically symmetric black holes and rotating and/or axially symmetric ones, such as between Schwarzschild black holes and Kerr black holes, and between Schwarzschild black holes and Taub-NUT black holes. However, the transformations in the two samples are based on different physical mechanisms. The former connection arises from the exponentiation of spin operators, while the latter from a duality operation. In this paper, we mainly investigate how the connections manifest in the dynamics of black holes. Specifically, we focus on studying the correlations of quasinormal frequencies among Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Taub-NUT black holes. This analysis allows us to explore the physics of complex-coordinate transformations in the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the Non-minimally Coupled Gravity with Electromagnetism</title>

Abstract: Since the general relativistic approach requires exotic matter with negative energy density, constructing wormholes containing realistic matter is a crucial challenge. Therefore, extending General Relativity to non-minimal cases may be an alternative option. In this paper, we investigate wormholes which are supported by the non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity in $Y(R)F^2$ form where $F^2$ is the Maxwell invariant and $Y(R)$ is a function of the Ricci scalar $R$. We consider both electrically and magnetically charged cases. Then we give some exact asymptotically AdS/dS and flat solutions for traversable wormhole geometries. By discussing whether these obtained geometries satisfy the energy conditions and vanishing sound speed condition, we determine stable solutions containing realistic matter for some parameter values.</description>

      <title>Accuracy limitations of existing numerical relativity waveforms on the data analysis of current and future ground-based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detectors improve in sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratios of compact binary coalescences will dramatically increase, reaching values in the hundreds and potentially thousands. Such strong signals offer both exciting scientific opportunities and pose formidable challenges to the template waveforms used for interpretation. Current waveform models are informed by calibrating or fitting to numerical relativity waveforms and such strong signals may unveil computational errors in generating these waveforms. In this paper, we isolate a single source of computational error, that of the finite grid resolution, and investigate its impact on parameter estimation for aLIGO and Cosmic Explorer. We demonstrate that increasing the inclination angle or decreasing the mass ratio $q$ ($q \leq 1 $) raises the resolution required for unbiased parameter estimation. We quantify the error associated with the highest-resolution waveform utilized in our study using an extrapolation procedure on the median of recovered posteriors and confirm the accuracy of current waveforms for the synthetic sources. We introduce a measure to predict the necessary numerical resolution for unbiased parameter estimation and use it to predict that current waveforms are suitable for equal and moderately unequal mass binaries for both detectors. However, current waveforms fail to meet accuracy requirements for high signal-to-noise ratio signals from highly unequal mass ratio binaries $(q \lesssim 1/6)$, for all inclinations in Cosmic Explorer, and for high inclinations in future updates to LIGO. Given that the resolution requirement becomes more stringent with more unequal mass ratios, current waveforms may lack the necessary accuracy, even at median signal-to-noise ratios for future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, evidence of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals observed by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, has prompted investigations into their origins. We explore the compatibility of a proposed inflationary scenario, incorporating an intermediate null energy condition (NEC)-violating phase, with the PTA observations. The NEC violation potentially amplifies the primordial tensor power spectrum, offering a promising explanation for PTA observations. Numerical analyses, primarily focused on NANOGrav's 15-year results, reveal the model's compatibility with PTA data. Notably, the model predicts a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the mHz frequency range, which sets our scenario apart from other interpretations predicting a red primordial GW spectrum on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution of the Kantowski-Sachs universe in the context of a bulk viscous string in teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyzed the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model along with teleparallel gravity, where a bulk viscous fluid containing one-dimensional cosmic strings serves as the source for the energy$-$momentum tensor. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations, we employed the proportionality condition linking the shear scalar $(\sigma)$ and the expansion scalar $(\theta)$, establishing a relationship between metric potentials. Another approach employed is the utilization of the Hybrid Expansion Law (HEL). The discussion focuses on the behaviour of the accelerating universe concerning the specific choice of a nonlinear (or power law model) of teleparallel gravity $f(T)=\alpha T + \beta T^m$, where
  $T$ is the torsion scalar, $\alpha$ , and $\beta$ are model parameters and $m$ is restricted to greater than or equal to 2. The effective equation of the state parameter $(\omega_{eff})$ of models I, II and III will support the acceleration behavior of the universe. We observed that the null energy condition and weak energy condition are obeyed but violate the strong energy condition as per the present accelerating expansion. Under specific model parameter constraints, the universe shows a transition from a decelerating to an accelerated phase.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation From Fluctuating Baby-Skyrme Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the inflationary dynamics induced by small fluctuations on the Skyrme brane, characterized by a time-dependent perturbative function $\tilde{\phi}$. In the low-energy regime, the model successfully reproduces standard inflation, with a potential term dictated by the Skyrmion at the brane. Gravity localization is achieved at the brane, and the lowest energy scale is established at the asymptotic boundary. The model demonstrates the capability to emulate standard inflation dynamics, resembling $\tilde{\phi}^4$ potential characteristics under certain conditions. At higher energy levels, the behaviour of $\tilde{\phi}$ is contingent upon the Skyrme term coupling constant $\lambda$, influencing reheating phases. The wave-like nature of fluctuations allows for energy transfer, resulting in a possibly lower reheating temperature. We also discuss the prospect of $\lambda$ changing sign during inflation, presenting a non-standard coupling dependent on the matter field.</description>

Abstract: The Fermat principle is advocated to be a convenient tool to analyze the light propagation in a curved space time. It is shown that in the weak deflection regime the light ray trajectories can be systematically described by applying the Lindstedt--Poicare method of solving perturbatively the nonlinear oscillation equations. The expansion in terms of inverse invariant impact parameter for Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstr\"om and Kerr (equatorial motion) metrics is described. The corresponding deflection angles are computed to the third order. Only algebraic operations are involved in the derivation; no integrations or Fourier expansion of elliptic functions are necessary.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in shift-symmetric theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative theories of gravity may be put to the test by making use of gravitational wave observations. Scalar-tensor theories provide a relatively simple framework that allows for compact object solutions with characteristics different from those of their general relativity counterparts. In shift-symmetric theories, black hole hair may arise when a linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant is introduced. The effect of this coupling on the black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) has been shown to be small, therefore limiting the observational interest in the theory. In general, however, one expects that additional shift-symmetric terms in the Lagrangian may be relevant, and indeed, it has been shown that they can have a nontrivial impact on the mass and scalar charge of the stationary solutions. In this work we explore the effect that various such terms have on the axial and polar QNMs of the hairy black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Geometries Supported by Strange Quark Matter and Phantom-like Generalized Chaplygin gas within $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of wormhole (WH) physics is the inclusion of exotic matter, which requires violating the null energy condition. Here, we explore the potential for WHs to be sustained by quark matter under conditions of extreme density along with the phantom-like generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) in symmetric teleparallel gravity. Theoretical and experimental studies on baryon structures indicate that strange quark matter, composed of u (up), d (down), and s (strange) quarks, represents the most energy-efficient form of baryonic matter. Drawing from these theoretical insights, we use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model equation of state to characterize ordinary quark matter. By formulating specific configurations for the bag parameter, we develop several WH models corresponding to different shape functions for the isotropic and anisotropic cases. Our analysis strongly suggests that an isotropic WH is not theoretically possible. Furthermore, we investigate traversable WH solutions utilizing a phantom-like GCCG, examining their feasibility. This equation of state, capable of violating the null energy condition, can elucidate late-time cosmic acceleration through various beneficial parameters. In this framework, we derive WH solutions for both constant and variable redshift functions. We have employed the volume integral quantifier (VIQ) method for both studies to assess the quantity of exotic matter. Furthermore, we have done the equilibrium analysis through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which supports the viability of our constructed WH model.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Conservation Laws in Horava Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Horava gravity has been proposed as a renormalizable quantum gravity without the ghost problem through anisotropic scaling dimensions which break Lorentz symmetry in UV. In the Hamiltonian formalism, due to the Lorentz-violating terms, the constraint structure looks quite different from that of general relativity (GR) but we have recently found that "there exists the case where we can recover the same number of degrees of freedom as in GR", in a rather general set-up. In this paper, we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine the full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its associated conservation laws in Horava gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the full Diff symmetry in the action can also be recovered when a certain condition, called "super-condition", which super-selects the Lorentz-symmetric sector in Horava gravity, is satisfied. This indicates that the broken Lorentz symmetry, known as "foliation-preserving" Diff, is just an "apparent" symmetry of the Horava gravity action and rather its "full action symmetry can be as large as the Diff in GR ". The super-condition exactly corresponds to the tertiary constraint in Hamiltonian formalism which is the second-class constraint and provides a non-trivial realization of the Lorentz symmetry otherwise being absent apparently. From the recovered Lorentz symmetry in the action, we obtain the conservation laws with the Noether currents as in covariant theories. The general formula for the conserved Noether charges reproduces the mass of four-dimensional static black holes with an "arbitrary" cosmological constant in Horava gravity, and is independent of ambiguities associated with the choice of asymptotic boundaries. We also discuss several challenging problems, including its implications to Hamiltonian formalism, black hole thermodynamics, radiations from colliding black holes.</description>

      <title>Weyl quadratic gravity as a gauge theory and non-metricity vs torsion duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review (non-supersymmetric) gauge theories of four-dimensional space-time symmetries and their quadratic action. The only true gauge theory of such a symmetry (with a physical gauge boson) that has an exact geometric interpretation, generates Einstein gravity in its spontaneously broken phase and is anomaly-free, is that of Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). Gauging the full conformal group does not generate a true gauge theory of physical (dynamical) associated gauge bosons. Regarding the Weyl gauge symmetry, it is naturally realised in Weyl conformal geometry, where it admits two different but equivalent geometric formulations, of same quadratic action: one non-metric but torsion-free, the other Weyl gauge-covariant and metric (with respect to a new differential operator). To clarify the origin of this intriguing result, a third equivalent formulation of this gauge symmetry is constructed using the standard, modern approach on the tangent space (uplifted to space-time by the vielbein), which is metric but has vectorial torsion. This shows an interesting duality vectorial non-metricity vs vectorial torsion of the corresponding formulations, related by a projective transformation. We comment on the physical meaning of these results.</description>

      <title>Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity: Finding Exact Solutions Without Tears</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-step procedure for finding Kerr-type rotating black hole solutions without tears. Considering the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating gravity in four dimensions which admits a different speed of gravity, we find the exact rotating black hole solutions (with or without cosmological constant). We find that the singular region extends to r &lt; 0 region from the ring singularity at r = 0 in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. There are two Killing horizons where g^rr = 0 and the black hole thermodynamics laws are still valid. We find the rotating black hole solutions with electromagnetic charges only when we consider the noble electromagnetic couplings, in such a way that the speed of light is the same as the speed of gravity. With the noble choice of couplings, our Lorentz-violating gravity can be consistent with the recently-observed time delay of the coincident GW and GRB signals. Furthermore, in Appendices, we show that (a) the uniqueness of the invariant line element ds^2 under Diff_F, contrary to LV action, (b) the solutions are the Petrov type I with four distinct principal null vectors, and (c) the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesic particles are not separable.</description>

      <title>Holographic phenomenology via overlapping degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11016v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as "overlapping degrees of freedom". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim 500\, k_{\mathrm{LHC}}\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, i.e. using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory.

      <description>arXiv:2402.12430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the question of scale versus conformal invariance on maximally symmetric curved backgrounds and study general 2-derivative conformally invariant free theories of vectors and tensors. For spacetime dimension $D&gt;4$, these conformal theories can be diagonalized into standard massive fields in which unbroken conformal symmetry non-trivially mixes components of different spins. In $D=4$, the tensor case becomes a conformal theory mixing a partially massless spin-2 field with a massless spin-1 field. For massless linearized gravity in $D = 4$, we confirm through direct calculation that correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators take the conformally invariant form, despite the absence of standard conformal symmetry at the level of the action.</description>

Abstract: We investigated a possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), cosmic chronometers, and baryon acoustic oscillation samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of an up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Consistent extinction model for type Ia supernovae in Cepheid-based calibration galaxies and its impact on $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most recent SH0ES measurement of the Hubble constant employs corrections of type Ia supernova magnitudes due to extinction in their host galaxies. These corrections are estimated using a probabilistic model which is trained on Hubble flow (z&gt;0.03) supernovae and extrapolated to the calibration galaxies (those with observed Cepheids), despite the fact that the latter are selected based on criteria favouring disky and dust-rich systems. We show that this standard approach underestimates the brightness of reddened supernovae in the high stellar-mass ($M_{\star}&gt;10^{10}M_{\odot}$) calibration galaxies. This can be traced back to the fact that for these galaxies, a low total-to-selective extinction coefficient (R_B~3) is assumed, while for the low stellar-mass analogues a more standard R_ B~4 is adopted. We propose a minimalistic modification of the extinction model in the calibration galaxies in order to alleviate this systematic effect. The modification is twofold and it involves: (i) the same, Milky Way-like distribution of R_B (with mean R_B of 4.3 -- consistent with the extinction curve used for colour corrections of the Cepheids -- and scatter 0.4) and (ii) a modified shape of the E(B-V) reddening distribution while keeping the same effective slope of the supernova peak magnitude-colour relation and the same mean E(B-V) reddening as measured for supernovae in the Hubble flow. We show that this new approach yields a significantly better fit ($\Delta BIC=-11$) to the calibration data and results in a lower value of $H_{0}$. Our result is $H_{0}=70.5\pm1$ km/s/Mpc implying a reduction of the Hubble constant tension from $5.2\sigma$ to $2.8\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally encode aspects of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Relativistic head-on collisions of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Transmission of quantum information through quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>
