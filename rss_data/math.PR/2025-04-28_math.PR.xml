      <title>Heat kernels, intrinsic contractivity and ergodicity of discrete-time Markov chains killed by potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov chains on countably infinite state spaces, which are perturbed by rather general confining (i.e.\ growing at infinity) potentials. Using a discrete-time analogue of the classical Feynman--Kac formula, we obtain two-sided estimates for the $n$-step heat kernels $u_n(x,y)$ of the perturbed chain. These estimates are of the form $u_n(x,y)\asymp \lambda_0^n\phi_0(x)\widehat\phi_0(y)+F_n(x,y)$, where $\phi_0$ (and $\widehat\phi_0$) are the (dual) eigenfunctions for the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$; the perturbation $F_n(x,y)$ is explicitly given, and it vanishes if either $x$ or $y$ is in a bounded set. The key assumptions are that the chain is uniformly lazy and that the \enquote{direct step property} (DSP) is satisfied. This means that the chain is more likely to move from state $x$ to state $y$ in a single step rather than in two or more steps. Starting from the form of the heat kernel estimate, we define the intrinsic (or ground-state transformed) chains and we introduce time-dependent ultracontractivity notions -- asymptotic and progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity -- which we can link to the growth behaviour of the confining potential; this allows us to consider arbitrarily slow growing potentials. These new notions of ultracontractivity also lead to a characterization of uniform (quasi-)ergodicity of the perturbed and the ground-state transformed Markov chains. At the end of the paper, we give various examples that illustrate how our findings relate to existing models, e.g.\ nearest-neighbour walks on infinite graphs, subordinate processes or non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Independent Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal inequalities refer to bounds on expected values of the supremum of averages of random variables over a collection. They play a crucial role in the study of non-parametric and high-dimensional estimators, and especially in the study of empirical risk minimizers. Although the expected supremum over an infinite collection appears more often in these applications, the expected supremum over a finite collection is a basic building block. This follows from the generic chaining argument. For the case of finite maximum, most existing bounds stem from the Bonferroni inequality (or the union bound). The optimality of such bounds is not obvious, especially in the context of heavy-tailed random vectors.
  In this article, we consider the problem of finding sharp upper and lower bounds for the expected $L_{\infty}$ norm of the mean of finite-dimensional random vectors under marginal variance bounds and an integrable envelope condition.</description>

      <title>Kalman-Langevin dynamics : exponential convergence, particle approximation and numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics has found a large number of applications in sampling, optimization and estimation. Preconditioning the gradient in the dynamics with the covariance - an idea that originated in literature related to solving estimation and inverse problems using Kalman techniques - results in a mean-field (McKean-Vlasov) SDE. We demonstrate exponential convergence of the time marginal law of the mean-field SDE to the Gibbs measure with non-Gaussian potentials. This extends previous results, obtained in the Gaussian setting, to a broader class of potential functions. We also establish uniform in time bounds on all moments and convergence in $p$-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we show convergence of a weak particle approximation, that avoids computing the square root of the empirical covariance matrix, to the mean-field limit. Finally, we prove that an explicit numerical scheme for approximating the particle dynamics converges, uniformly in number of particles, to its continuous-time limit, addressing non-global Lipschitzness in the measure.</description>

      <title>Pathwise It\^o isometry for scaled quadratic variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of scaled quadratic variation was originally introduced by E. Gladyshev in 1961 in the context of Gaussian processes, where it was defined as the limit of the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process. In this paper, we extend this notion beyond the Gaussian framework for any real-valued continuous function by formulating it in a pathwise manner along a given sequence of partitions. We demonstrate that, for classical Gaussian processes such as fractional Brownian motion, this pathwise definition coincides with the traditional one up to a constant factor. Furthermore, we establish that the scaled quadratic variation is invariant under smooth transformations and satisfies a pathwise It\^o isometry-type result, derived without relying on any expectation arguments</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs with correlated, non-stationary Stratonovich noise of Dean--Kawasaki type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of the author and Gess [27] develop a robust well-posedness theory for a broad class of conservative stochastic PDEs, with both probabilistically stationary and non-stationary Stratonovich noise, and with irregular noise coefficients like the square root. However, one case left untreated by [27] is the case of SPDEs that combine conservative, non-stationary Stratonovich noise with square root-like nonlinearities. Such equations arise naturally in the fluctuating hydrodynamics of inhomogenous systems, and a new analysis is required to handle certain discontinuous coefficients appearing in their It\^o formulations. We treat the discontinuities by showing that the equation exhibits a novel regularization of the logarithm of the solution, and establish the well-posedness by building on the concept of a stochastic kinetic solution introduced in [27].</description>

      <title>Temporal quadratic and higher order variation for the nonlinear stochastic heat equation and applications to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic heat equation which includes a fractional power of the Laplacian of order $\alpha \in (1, 2]$ and it is driven by a nonlinear space-time Gaussian white noise. We study two types of power variations for the solution to this equation: the renormalized quadratic variation and the power variation of order $\frac{2\alpha}{\alpha -1}$, both over an equidistant partition of the unit interval. We prove that these two sequences admit nontrivial limits when the mesh of the partition goes to zero. We apply these results to identify certain parameters of the stochastic heat equation.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Deterministic Density Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based Transport Modeling (SBTM) for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$. While diffusion generative modeling relies on pre-training the score function $\nabla \log f_t$ using samples from $\pi$, SBTM addresses the more general and challenging setting where only $\nabla \log\pi$ is known. SBTM approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on KL$(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. The learned score gives immediate access to relative Fisher information, providing a built-in convergence diagnostic. The deterministic trajectories are smooth, interpretable, and free of Brownian-motion noise, while having the same distribution as ULA. We prove that SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. We further extend our framework to annealed dynamics, to handle non log-concave targets. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: SBTM converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is easily integrated with annealed dynamics. We compare to the baselines of ULA and annealed ULA.</description>

      <title>Upper and lower bounds of the value function for optimal control in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of nonsmooth analysis in the Wasserstein space to finite-horizon optimal control problems for nonlocal continuity equations. We characterize the value function as a strict viscosity solution of the corresponding Bellman equation using the notions of $\varepsilon$-subdifferentials and $\varepsilon$-superdifferentials. The main paper's result is the fact that continuous subsolutions and supersolutions of this Bellman equation yield lower and upper bounds for the value function. These estimates rely on proximal calculus in the space of probability measures and the Moreau-Yosida regularization. Furthermore, the upper estimates provide a family of approximately optimal feedback strategies that realize the concept of proximal aiming.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm using the framework of Poincar\'e inequalities. We describe the Multiple-try Metropolis as an auxiliary variable implementation of a resampling approximation to an ideal Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. Under suitable moment conditions on the importance weights, we derive explicit Poincar\'e comparison results between the Multiple-try algorithm and the ideal algorithm. We characterize the spectral gap of the latter, and finally in the Gaussian case prove explicit non-asymptotic convergence bounds for Multiple-try Metropolis by comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat the optimal linear filtering problem for a sum of two second order uncorrelated generalized stochastic processes. This is an operator equation involving covariance operators. We study both the wide-sense stationary case and the non-stationary case. In the former case the equation simplifies into a convolution equation. The solution is the Radon--Nikodym derivative between non-negative tempered Radon measures, for signal and signal plus noise respectively, in the frequency domain. In the non-stationary case we work with pseudodifferential operators with symbols in Sj\"ostrand modulation spaces which admits the use of its spectral invariance properties.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for slow-fast systems of rough differential equations via controlled paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the strong averaging principle for a slow-fast system of rough differential equations. The slow and the fast component of the system are driven by a rather general random rough path and Brownian rough path, respectively. These two driving noises are assumed to be independent. A prominent example of the driver of the slow component is fractional Brownian rough path with Hurst parameter between 1/3 and 1/2. We work in the framework of controlled path theory, which is one of the most widely-used frameworks in rough path theory. To prove our main theorem, we carry out Khas'minskii's time-discretizing method in this framework.</description>

      <title>On a class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A step-reinforced random walk is a discrete-time stochastic process with long-range dependence. At each step, with a fixed probability $\alpha$, the so-called positively step-reinforced random walk repeats one of its previous steps, chosen randomly and uniformly from its entire history. Alternatively, with probability $1-\alpha$, it makes an independent move. For the so-called negatively step-reinforced random walk, the process is similar, but any repeated step is taken with its direction reversed. These random walks have been introduced respectively by Simon (1955) and Bertoin (2024) and are sometimes refered to the self-confident step-reinforced random walk and the counterbalanced step-reinforced random walk respectively. In this work, we introduce a new class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks for which we prove the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. In particular, our work provides a unified treatment of the elephant random walk introduced by Schutz and Trimper (2004) and the positively and negatively step-reinforced random walks</description>

      <title>Sample-Path Large Deviations for Functionals of Poisson Cluster Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sample-path large deviation principles for the centered cumulative functional of marked Poisson cluster processes in the Skorokhod space equipped with the M1 topology, under joint regular variation assumptions on the marks and the offspring distributions governing the propagation mechanism. These findings can also be interpreted as hidden regular variation of the cluster processes' functionals, extending the results in Dombry et al. (2022) to cluster processes with heavy-tailed characteristics, including mixed Binomial Poisson cluster processes and Hawkes processes. Notably, by restricting to the adequate subspace of measures on D([0, 1], R+), and applying the correct normalization and scaling to the paths of the centered cumulative functional, the limit measure concentrates on paths with multiple large jumps.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Fixed-Magnetization Spin Systems at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin systems are fundamental models of statistical physics that provide insight into collective behavior across scientific domains. Their interest to computer science stems in part from the deep connection between the phase transitions they exhibit and the computational complexity of sampling from the probability distributions they describe. Our focus is on the geometry of spin configurations, motivated by applications to programmable matter and computational biology. Rigorous results in this vein are scarce because the natural setting of these applications is the low-temperature, fixed-magnetization regime. Recent progress in this regime is largely limited to spin systems under which magnetization concentrates, which enables the analysis to be reduced to that of the simpler, variable-magnetization case. More complicated models, like those that arise in applications, do not share this property.
  We study the geometry of spin configurations on the triangular lattice under the Generalized Potts Model (GPM), which generalizes many fundamental models of statistical physics, including the Ising, Potts, clock, and Blume--Capel models. Moreover, it specializes to models used to program active matter to solve tasks like compression and separation, and it is closely related to the Cellular Potts Model, widely used in computational models of biological processes. Our main result shows that, under the fixed-magnetization GPM at low temperature, spins of different types are typically partitioned into regions of mostly one type, separated by boundaries that have nearly minimal perimeter. The proof uses techniques from Pirogov--Sinai theory to extend a classic Peierls argument for the fixed-magnetization Ising model, and introduces a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models.</description>

      <title>Characters of symmetric groups: sharp bounds on virtual degrees and the Witten zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on characters of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. Our main application is a characterization of the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <title>Function-coherent gambles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces function-coherent gambles, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Framework for Stochastic Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns models and convergence principles for dealing with stochasticity in a wide range of algorithms arising in nonlinear analysis and optimization in Hilbert spaces. It proposes a flexible geometric framework within which existing solution methods can be recast and improved, and new ones can be designed. Almost sure weak, strong, and linear convergence results are established in particular for stochastic fixed point iterations, the stochastic gradient descent method, and stochastic extrapolated parallel algorithms for feasibility problems. In these areas, the proposed algorithms exceed the features and convergence guarantees of the state of the art. Numerical applications to signal and image recovery are provided.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Solvability and Bubbling in 2D Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation on a periodic 2D domain, driven by infinite-dimensional Gaussian noise in a Sobolev class. We establish strong local well-posedness in the energy space and characterize blow-up at random times in terms of energy concentration at small scales (bubbling). By iteration, we construct pathwise global weak solutions, with energy evolving as a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process, and prove uniqueness within this class. These results offer a stochastic counterpart to the deterministic concept of Struwe solutions. The approach relies on a transformation that leads to a magnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with random gauge coefficients.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling via Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>
