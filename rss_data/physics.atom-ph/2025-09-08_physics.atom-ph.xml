      <title>Simulated Laser Cooling and Magneto-Optical Trapping of Group IV Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the Group IV (a.k.a. Group 14 or tetrel) atoms silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). These elements each possess a strong Type-II transition ($J \rightarrow J' = J-1$) between the metastable $s^2p^2 \,^3 P_1$ state and the excited $s^2ps'\, ^3P_0^o$ state at an accessible laser wavelength, making them amenable to laser cooling and trapping. We focus on the application of this scheme to Sn, which has several features that make it attractive for precision measurement applications. We perform numerical simulations of atomic beam slowing, capture into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), and subsequent sub-Doppler cooling and compression in a blue-detuned MOT of Sn atoms. We also discuss a realistic experimental setup for realizing a high phase-space density sample of Sn atoms.</description>

      <title>Microwave Spectroscopy of the Muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ Fine Structure Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a microwave spectroscopy measurement of the muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ fine structure transition, yielding a transition frequency of $9871.0 \pm 7.0~\mathrm{MHz}$, in agreement with state-of-the-art QED predictions within one standard deviation. In combination with the recent Lamb shift result, the $2P_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ splitting is determined, improving the spectroscopic characterization of the $n=2$ manifold in muonium. These results provide a stringent test of bound-state QED in a purely leptonic system and establish a path toward future searches for Lorentz violation and muon-specific new physics.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix description of high-harmonic generation in multi-electron atoms: exploring sub-cycle correlation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is one of the fundamental processes at the heart of attosecond physics. Traditionally viewed as an effective single-particle effect, recent advances have focused on contributions beyond this single-particle picture to the harmonic spectrum, as well as on probing electron correlations through HHG in atoms, molecules, and solids. In this paper, we introduce a reduced density matrix description to explore and to quantify correlation effects on a sub-cycle time scale and apply this approach to prototypical multi-electron atoms. By comparing noble gas atoms (He, Ne) with alkaline earth atoms (Be, Mg) exposed to driving fields with similar Keldysh parameters, we show that the sub-cycle variation of correlation parameters differs markedly for noble gases and alkaline earth atoms. We provide an intuitive explanation of these surprising effects based on the dynamics of natural orbitals and discuss the effect of this ultrafast correlation dynamics on the HHG spectrum.</description>

      <title>Experiment to test the incompleteness of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For almost 100 years, the incompleteness of quantum formalism and the probabilistic nature of measurement have been debated without any experiment being able to settle these questions. There exist contingent quantum interpretations that share the same mathematical formalism but have contradictory world views. In double-slit interference experiments, standard quantum theory does not take particle size into account, which is not the case in de Broglie's double solution theory. We use the large size of Rydberg atoms to propose an experiment to test the incompleteness of the standard quantum formalism. We present an interference experiment with asymmetric slits, a large slit that allows Rydberg atoms to pass through and a grating of small slits that do not. We show with numerical simulations that the transmission densities in the standard interpretation and in the double solution interpretation give very different results (one peak instead of two). Experimental implementation now seems possible and would be a crucial test between these two interpretations.</description>

      <title>Efficient optical configurations for trapped-ion entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity and parallel realization in scalable platforms of the two-qubit entangling gates fundamental to universal quantum computing constitutes one of the largest challenges in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integrated optical addressing of trapped-ion qubits offers routes to scaling the high-fidelity optical control demonstrated to date in small systems. Here we show that in addition to scaling, capabilities practically enabled by integrated optics can substantially alleviate laser powers required for both light-shift (LS) and Molmer-Sorensen (MS) geometric phase gates acting on long-lived ground-state qubit encodings in a broad range of ion species. In the proposed gate schemes utilizing carrier nulling via ion positioning at phase-stable standing-wave (SW) nodes, our calculations suggest that suppressed spontaneous photon scattering at the SW node allows for gate drives operating at smaller Raman detunings, resulting in approximately an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement (and significantly larger in certain parameter regimes) for gates of a given duration and scattering-limited fidelity as compared to conventional running wave (RW)-based approaches. The SW schemes have the additional benefit of simultaneously eliminating undesired coherent couplings that typically limit gate speeds. Our work quantifies power requirements for multiple ion species and enhancements to be expected from carrier-nulled configurations practically enabled by integrated delivery, and informs experiments and systems for realization of fast and power-efficient laser-based entangling gates in scalable platforms.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact $C_v$ on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $|m|=0$ and $|m|=1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for the two components. As $T_F$ increases, the anisotropy is no longer resolved and the near-resonant contact scales linearly with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. The $T/T_F$ dependence across the attractive regime reveals opposite trends in the strongly and weakly interacting limits, which are accurately represented by the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial coefficient, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of strongly interacting $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this letter, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation is characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Magnetic Evaporative Beamline Cooling for Preparation of Cold Atomic Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the endpoint of the beta spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular (T$_{2}$) tritium sources, at currents of at least 10$^{15}$ atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for beta spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magneto-gravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique, and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.</description>
