      <title>Unified signal response for stochastic resonance in bistable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of stochastic resonance, wherein the stimulus-response of a system can be maximized by an intermediate level of noise, has been extensively investigated through linear response theory. As yet a unified response-noise or response-frequency formula embracing diverse factors, such as noise color, damping coefficients, and coupling, is still lacking. In the present work, we theoretically investigate the benefit roles of Gaussian white noise and Ornstein- Uhlenbeck noise on the signal amplification of systems ranging from a single overdamped bistable particle to the mean-field coupled underdamped Duffing oscillators and severally deduce their signal response expressions. We find that the formulas of signal response in these different cases can be reduced to a uniform Lorentz function form. Furthermore, based on the general expression, we explain explicitly the role of driving frequency, coupling and the noise color on stochastic resonance. Our results contribute to a deep theoretical understanding of stochastic resonance in bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling Soil as a Living System: Feedback between Microbial Activity and Spatial Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil is a complex, dynamic material, with physical properties that depend on its biological content. We propose a cellular automaton model for self-organizing soil structure, where soil aggregates and serves as food for microbial species. These, in turn, produce nutrients that facilitate self-amplification, establishing a cyclical dynamic of consumption and regeneration. Our model explores the spatial interactions between these components and their role in sustaining a balanced ecosystem. The main results demonstrate that (1) spatial structure supports a stable living state, preventing population collapse or uncontrolled growth; (2) the spatial model allows for the coexistence of parasitic species, which exploit parts of the system without driving it to extinction; and (3) optimal growth conditions for microbes are associated to diverse length scales in the soil structure, suggesting that heterogeneity is key to ecosystem resilience. These findings highlight the importance of spatio-temporal dynamics of life in soil ecology.</description>

      <title>Innovation-exnovation dynamics on trees and trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovation and its complement exnovation describe the progression of realized possibilities from the past to the future, and the process depends on the structure of the underlying graph. For example, the phylogenetic tree represents the unique path of mutations to a single species. To a technology, paths are manifold, like a "truss." We solve for the phase diagram of a model, where a population innovates while outrunning exnovation. The dynamics progress on random graphs that capture the degree of historical contingency. Higher connectivity speeds innovation but also increases the risk of system collapse. We show how dynamics and structural connectivity conspire to unleash innovative diversity or to drive it extinct.</description>

      <title>Enhancing deep neural networks through complex-valued representations and Kuramoto synchronization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.</description>
