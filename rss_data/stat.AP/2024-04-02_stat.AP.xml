      <title>A group testing based exploration of age-varying factors in chlamydia infections among Iowa residents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group testing, a method that screens subjects in pooled samples rather than individually, has been employed as a cost-effective strategy for chlamydia screening among Iowa residents. In efforts to deepen our understanding of chlamydia epidemiology in Iowa, several group testing regression models have been proposed. Different than previous approaches, we expand upon the varying coefficient model to capture potential age-varying associations with chlamydia infection risk. In general, our model operates within a Bayesian framework, allowing regression associations to vary with a covariate of key interest. We employ a stochastic search variable selection process for regularization in estimation. Additionally, our model can integrate random effects to consider potential geographical factors and estimate unknown assay accuracy probabilities. The performance of our model is assessed through comprehensive simulation studies. Upon application to the Iowa group testing dataset, we reveal a significant age-varying racial disparity in chlamydia infections. We believe this discovery has the potential to inform the enhancement of interventions and prevention strategies, leading to more effective chlamydia control and management, thereby promoting health equity across all populations.</description>

      <title>A Multidimensional Fractional Hawkes Process for Multiple Earthquake Mainshock Aftershock Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most point process models for earthquakes currently in the literature assume the magnitude distribution is i.i.d. potentially hindering the ability of the model to describe the main features of data sets containing multiple earthquake mainshock aftershock sequences in succession. This study presents a novel multidimensional fractional Hawkes process model designed to capture magnitude dependent triggering behaviour by incorporating history dependence into the magnitude distribution. This is done by discretising the magnitude range into disjoint intervals and modelling events with magnitude in these ranges as the subprocesses of a mutually exciting Hawkes process using the Mittag-Leffler density as the kernel function. We demonstrate this model's use by applying it to two data sets, Japan and the Middle America Trench, both containing multiple mainshock aftershock sequences and compare it to the existing ETAS model by using information criteria, residual diagnostics and retrospective prediction performance. We find that for both data sets all metrics indicate that the multidimensional fractional Hawkes process performs favourably against the ETAS model. Furthermore, using the multidimensional fractional Hawkes process we are able to infer characteristics of the data sets that are consistent with results currently in the literature and that cannot be found by using the ETAS model.</description>

      <title>DEMO: Dose Exploration, Monitoring, and Optimization Using a Biological Mediator for Clinical Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase 1-2 designs provide a methodological advance over phase 1 designs for dose finding by using both clinical response and toxicity. A phase 1-2 trial still may fail to select a truly optimal dose. because early response is not a perfect surrogate for long term therapeutic success. To address this problem, a generalized phase 1-2 design first uses a phase 1-2 design's components to identify a set of candidate doses, adaptively randomizes patients among the candidates, and after longer follow up selects a dose to maximize long-term success rate. In this paper, we extend this paradigm by proposing a design that exploits an early treatment-related, real-valued biological outcome, such as pharmacodynamic activity or an immunological effect, that may act as a mediator between dose and clinical outcomes, including tumor response, toxicity, and survival time. We assume multivariate dose-outcome models that include effects appearing in causal pathways from dose to the clinical outcomes. Bayesian model selection is used to identify and eliminate biologically inactive doses. At the end of the trial, a therapeutically optimal dose is chosen from the set of doses that are acceptably safe, clinically effective, and biologically active to maximize restricted mean survival time. Results of a simulation study show that the proposed design may provide substantial improvements over designs that ignore the biological variable.</description>

      <title>Methods of Stochastic Field Theory in Non-Equilibrium Systems -- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a couple of investigations related to symmetry breaking phenomena, 'spontaneous stochasticity' and 'ergodicity breaking' have led to significant impacts in a variety of fields related to the stochastic processes such as economics and finance. We investigate on the origins and effects of those original symmetries in the action from the mathematical and the effective field theory points of view. It is naturally expected that whenever the system respects any symmetry, it would be spontaneously broken once the system falls into a vacuum state which minimizes an effective action of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>

      <title>Transnational Network Dynamics of Problematic Information Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study maps the spread of two cases of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation in Spanish and French in Latin American and French-speaking communities on Facebook, and thus contributes to understanding the dynamics, reach and consequences of emerging transnational misinformation networks. The findings show that co-sharing behavior of public Facebook groups created transnational networks by sharing videos of Medicos por la Verdad (MPV) conspiracy theories in Spanish and hydroxychloroquine-related misinformation sparked by microbiologist Didier Raoult (DR) in French, usually igniting the surge of locally led interest groups across the Global South. Using inferential methods, the study shows how these networks are enabled primarily by shared cultural and thematic attributes among Facebook groups, effectively creating very large, networked audiences. The study contributes to the understanding of how potentially harmful conspiracy theories and misinformation transcend national borders through non-English speaking online communities, further highlighting the overlooked role of transnationalism in global misinformation diffusion and the potentially disproportionate harm that it causes in vulnerable communities across the globe.</description>

      <title>Performance triggered adaptive model reduction for soil moisture estimation in precision irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture information is crucial for developing precise irrigation control strategies to enhance water use efficiency. Soil moisture estimation based on limited soil moisture sensors is crucial for obtaining comprehensive soil moisture information when dealing with large-scale agricultural fields. The major challenge in soil moisture estimation lies in the high dimensionality of the spatially discretized agro-hydrological models. In this work, we propose a performance-triggered adaptive model reduction approach to address this challenge. The pro- posed approach employs a trajectory-based unsupervised machine learning technique, and a prediction performance-based triggering scheme is designed to govern model updates adaptively in a way such that the prediction error between the reduced model and the original model over a prediction horizon is maintained below a predetermined threshold. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed based on the reduced model for soil moisture estimation. The applicability and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated extensively through the application to a simulated large-scale agricultural field.</description>

      <title>Traffic State Estimation from Vehicle Trajectories with Anisotropic Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately monitoring road traffic state is crucial for various applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</description>

      <title>Predicting milk traits from spectral data using Bayesian probabilistic partial least squares regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional spectral data--routinely generated in dairy production--are used to predict a range of traits in milk products. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is ubiquitously used for these prediction tasks. However, PLS regression is not typically viewed as arising from statistical inference of a probabilistic model, and parameter uncertainty is rarely quantified. Additionally, PLS regression does not easily lend itself to model-based modifications, coherent prediction intervals are not readily available, and the process of choosing the latent-space dimension, $\mathtt{Q}$, can be subjective and sensitive to data size. We introduce a Bayesian latent-variable model, emulating the desirable properties of PLS regression while accounting for parameter uncertainty in prediction. The need to choose $\mathtt{Q}$ is eschewed through a nonparametric shrinkage prior. The flexibility of the proposed Bayesian partial least squares (BPLS) regression framework is exemplified by considering sparsity modifications and allowing for multivariate response prediction. The BPLS regression framework is used in two motivating settings: 1) multivariate trait prediction from mid-infrared spectral analyses of milk samples, and 2) milk pH prediction from surface-enhanced Raman spectral data. The prediction performance of BPLS regression at least matches that of PLS regression. Additionally, the provision of correctly calibrated prediction intervals objectively provides richer, more informative inference for stakeholders in dairy production.</description>

      <title>Improving the Estimation of Site-Specific Effects and their Distribution in Multisite Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multisite trials, researchers are often interested in several inferential goals: estimating treatment effects for each site, ranking these effects, and studying their distribution. This study seeks to identify optimal methods for estimating these targets. Through a comprehensive simulation study, we assess two strategies and their combined effects: semiparametric modeling of the prior distribution, and alternative posterior summary methods tailored to minimize specific loss functions. Our findings highlight that the success of different estimation strategies depends largely on the amount of within-site and between-site information available from the data. We discuss how our results can guide balancing the trade-offs associated with shrinkage in limited data environments.</description>
