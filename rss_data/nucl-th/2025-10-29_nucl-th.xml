      <title>Updating GEANIE $^{239}$Pu prompt $\gamma$-ray experimental data using modern Hauser-Feshbach fission fragment decay model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate fission $\gamma$ rays for neutron-induced reactions on $^{239}$Pu with the Hauser-Feshbach fission fragment decay model. By applying the calculated fission $\gamma$ rays as a background contribution, the historical $^{239}$Pu(n,$x$n$\gamma$) reaction cross section data measured by the GEANIE (GErmanium Array for Neutron Induced Excitations) spectrometer are corrected. The correction also includes other (n,$x$n) reactions that have very similar energies to the $\gamma$ lines reported by GEANIE. In many cases, the original GEANIE data are strongly reduced and they become much closer to the statistical Hauser-Feshbach model predictions. The total inelastic scattering, (n,2n), and (n,3n) cross sections are inferred based on the corrected GEANIE data, and compared with available experimental data as well as the statistical model calculations. Expected $\gamma$-ray energy spectra for neutron-induced measurements on $^{239}$Pu are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Energy Loss in the Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks offer an invaluable hard probe of the droplets of quark gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC. Given their large mass, they are predominantly produced in hard scattering processes at the earliest moment of a collision and given their rarity they almost never annihilate with a heavy antiquark subsequently. This means that they experience, and probe, the entire history of the expanding, cooling, droplet of QGP from hydrodynamization through hadronization. Quantitative measurements of heavy quark final state observables therefore give us access to information about the transport properties of QGP as well as about medium modifications of hadronization. To date, the Hybrid strong/weak coupling Model of jet quenching has not included any implementation of the heavy-quark sector, which has made it impossible to confront its predictions with measurements of heavy quark and jet observables together, in a unified fashion. Here, we extend the Hybrid Model to investigate heavy quark observables for the first time. We introduce a strongly-coupled calculation of heavy-quark energy loss with the correct behavior when the heavy quarks are either ultrarelativistic or non-relativistic, Gaussian momentum broadening, and recombination of heavy quarks with medium partons using a local color neutralization model of hadronization. We compare our results for the suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and azimuthal anisotropies $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons and $\Lambda_c$ baryons, the $R_{\rm AA}$ of B-tagged jets, as well as baryon-to-meson ratios, with available experimental data from ALICE, ATLAS and CMS.</description>

      <title>A Euclidean Monte-Carlo-informed route to ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold great promise for studying real-time (Minkowski) dynamics of quantum field theories. Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial states remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield ground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle, guide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting scalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve comparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo data, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum circuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity scales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Impact of shell model interactions on WIMP-nucleus scattering observables for silicon and germanium targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. Dark matter direct detection experiments look for nuclear recoil signals from DM-nucleus elastic scattering, which can be used to characterise DM. Nuclear modelling of the target nucleus may impact the predicted DM-nucleus scattering rates, and affect interpretation of experimental signals. In this work, we investigate the impact of nuclear shell model interactions on DM nuclear responses for silicon and germanium targets using a SuperCDMS-like experimental parameters. Nuclear uncertainties resulting from shell model interaction choice in the nuclear form factors are roughly retained at the scattering rate and exclusion limit levels for certain nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-induced effects from Wess-Zumino-Witten terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vorticity-induced effects arising from the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. We first provide an alternative derivation of the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms in the presence of external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative expansion of the fermion determinant. We then employ the previously found correspondence in which vorticity is treated as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac fermions in flat spacetime. Using this, we derive vorticity-induced contributions for Nambu-Goldstone modes in the presence of electromagnetic fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials, including a vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum, and a vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. We also briefly discuss the phenomenological implications of these vorticity-induced effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically consistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most parametrisations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features sufficient to describe form factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we introduce two novel form factor parametrisations that allow resonance poles and left-hand cuts on the second Riemann sheet to be studied, while also making the connection to partial-wave amplitudes manifest.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium contributions to charm hadrons in a fluid-dynamic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on previous studies that demonstrated the applicability of a fluid-dynamic description of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the present work extends the framework by computing the out-of-equilibrium contributions to the distribution function of charm hadrons. The analysis includes corrections arising from the initial out-of-equilibrium distribution of charm quarks after a free-streaming phase, as well as from the freeze-out surface within fluid dynamics. These results enable the exact computation of integrated yields and transverse momentum distributions of charm hadrons for different values of the spatial diffusion coefficient, thereby providing the basis for a systematic determination of the charm transport coefficients. In addition, the limits of applicability of the approach are identified by determining the transverse-momentum region in which charm hadrons are described by a well-defined, positive distribution function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Minijet thermalization and jet transport coefficients in QCD kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory to investigate the thermalization of high-momentum on-shell partons (minijets) in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Our approach incorporates isotropic hard thermal loop screening to model soft quark and gluon exchanges, allowing us to verify consistency with established analytic results of jet transport coefficients. We perform kinetic simulations of minijets propagating through a thermal gluon plasma, incorporating both collinear radiation and elastic scatterings. The resulting evolution is compared to predictions from jet transport coefficients, including the longitudinal and transverse jet-quenching parameters $\hat{q}$, energy loss, and the drag coefficient. We find that standard definitions of jet transport coefficients neglect the contributions from recoiling medium particles. Including these contributions restores consistency with the kinetic evolution. Finally, we show that the minijet thermalization time scales remarkably well with $\hat{q}$ and we produce a phenomenological estimate of the minijet quenching time in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Asymmetry in Bosonic Gaussian Systems: A Resource-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry under consideration, coupled to an environment prepared in a symmetry-respecting pure Gaussian state. We further identify a family of tractable monotone functions of states that remain non-increasing under Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics, and are exactly conserved in closed systems. We demonstrate that these monotones are not generally respected under non-Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics. Along the way, we provide several technical results of independent interest to the quantum information and optics communities, including a new approach to the Stinespring dilation theorem, and an extension of Williamson's theorem for the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of Gaussian systems and conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Gravity Wave Phase Shift in a Cold Quark Star with a Nonconvex QCD BZT Shock Wave Van Der Waals Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate BZT shocks and the QCD phase transition in the dense core of a cold quark star in beta equilibrium subject to the multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) as a model of internal structure. When this system is expressed in terms of multiple components, it can be used to explore the impact of a phase transition from a hadronic state to a quark plasma state with a complex clustering structure. The clustering can take the form of colored diquarks or triquarks and bound colorless meson, baryon, or hyperon states at the phase transition boundary. The resulting multicomponent EoS system is nonconvex, which can give rise to Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) phase changing shock waves. Using the BZT shock wave condition we find constraints on the quark density and examine how this changes the tidal deformability of the compact core. These results are then combined with the TOV equations to find the resulting mass and radius relationship. These state are compared to recent astrophysical high-mass neutron star systems, which may provide evidence for a core that has undergone a quark gluon phase transition such as PSR 0943+10 or GW 190814.</description>

      <title>Effects of strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states in $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous studies revealed evidence of the strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states, $N(2080)3/2^-$ and $N(2270)3/2^-$, in the $\gamma p \to K^{*+} \Sigma^0 / K^{*0} \Sigma^+$ and $\gamma p \to \phi p$ reactions. Motivated by the differential cross-section data for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ from CLAS 2010, which exhibits some bump structures at $W \approx$ 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, we extend our previous analysis by investigating the effects of $N(1535)1/2^-$, $N(1875)3/2^-$, $N(2080)1/2^- \&amp;\ 3/2^-$ and $N(2270)1/2^- , 3/2^- \&amp;\ 5/2^-$, as strange partners of $P_c$ molecular states, in the reactions $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. The theoretical model employed in this study utilizes an effective Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approximation. It contains the contributions from $s$-channel with exchanges of $N$, $\Delta$, $N^*$ (including the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness), and $\Delta^*$; $t$-channel; $u$-channel; and the generalized contact term. The results based on the final fitted parameters are in good agreement with all available experimental data of both cross-sections and polarization observables for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. Notably, the $s$-channel exchanges of molecules significantly contribute to the bump structures in cross-sections for $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ at $W \approx$ 1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show considerable coherence with contributions from $s$-channel exchanges of general resonances to construct the overall structures of cross-sections. More abundant experiments, particularly for the reaction $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$, are necessary to further strengthen the constraints on the theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Covariant Energy Density Functionals for Neutron Star Matter Equation of State Modeling: Cross-Comparison Analysis Using \texttt{CompactObject}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes and contrasts different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the \texttt{CompactObject} package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.</description>

      <title>Variational Theory and Parquet Diagrams for Nuclear Systems: A Comprehensive Study of Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To deal with the problem of realistic nuclear interactions we have combined techniques of the Jastrow-Feenberg variational method and the local parquet-diagram theory. In the language of diagrammatic perturbation theory, ``commutator diagrams'' can be identified with non-parquet diagrams. We examine the physical processes described by these terms and include the relevant diagrams in a way that is suggested by the Jastrow-Feenberg approach. We show that the corrections from non-parquet contributions are, at short distances, larger than all other many-body effects.
  We examine here neutron matter as a prototype of systems with state-dependent interactions. Calculations are carried out for neutrons interacting via the so-called $v_8$ version of four popular interactions. We determine the structure and effective interactions and apply the method to the calculation of the energetics, structure and dynamic properties such as the single-particle self-energy and the dynamic response functions as well as BCS pairing in both singlet and triplet states. We find that many-body correlations lead to a strong reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and, therefore, to a suppression of the $^3P_2$ and $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ gaps. We also find pairing in $^3P_0$ states; the strength of the pairing gap depends sensitively on the potential model employed.</description>

      <title>Improved initial colliding nuclei density profile method for QMD-type transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the initial density profile is essential for studying heavy-ion collisions (HICs) with a transport model. Within the framework of the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)-type model, a novel method for generating nuclear density distributions based on a Fourier series expansion (FSE) is proposed. In this approach, the objective density distribution is expanded into a Fourier series to construct a filter function, which is then applied to select the randomly sampled nucleon coordinates in phase space to generate a three-dimensional nuclear density distribution that matches the desired profile. This new initialization method is further incorporated into the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, and the bubble-like density distribution of $^{96}$Ru is constructed, showing good stability. Then, by simulating $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions at $E_\mathrm{lab}=1500$ MeV/nucleon with different equations of state (EoS) and initialization methods, the effects of the initialization method on the final state observables and the constrained information of EoS are analyzed. It is found that the maximum system density increases when the new FSE initialization method is adopted, and results in an enhanced collective flow. Moreover, a relatively stiff EoS with $K_0&gt;280$ MeV is favored when adopting the Woods-Saxon initialization method, whereas an EoS of $K_0$ = 200-280 MeV is supported when using the FSE initialization. These results indicate that, within QMD-like transport models, the FSE filtering method provides a reliable means to sample nuclei with exotic density profiles, offering new insight to investigate nuclear structure and dense nuclear matter EoS through HICs.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help identify the host galaxy. Since GWs directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help with the study of cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting the EM emissions is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformability of neutron stars (NSs), combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. While several studies have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using dark BNSs (without EM counterparts), none have consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. We demonstrate the statistical robustness of our method using $50$ simulated BNS events following Gaussian and double Gaussian mass distributions, detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O5 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 35\%$ ($90\%$ credible interval). This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information. We also report the Hubble constant measurements obtained from a more realistic set of $5$ simulated BNS events.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing technology have enabled the study of fermionic systems at finite temperature via quantum simulations. This presents a novel approach to investigating the chiral phase transition in such systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states~(QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. Numerical results are obtained on a classical computer simulating circuit-based quantum computations. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks: The TQ4Q1.1 functions as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of exotic matter formation via the TQ4Q1.1 set of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for fully charmed or bottomed tetraquarks in three quantum configurations: scalar ($J^{PC} = 0^{++}$), axial vector ($J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$), and tensor ($J^{PC} = 2^{++}$). We adopt single-parton fragmentation at leading power and implement a nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) factorization scheme tailored to tetraquark Fock-state configurations. Short-distance inputs at the initial scale are modeled using updated calculations for both gluon- and heavy-quark-initiated channels. A threshold-consistent Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution is then applied via the novel Heavy-flavor nonrelativistic-evolution (HF-NRevo) hybrid scheme. We provide the first systematic treatment of uncertainties from nonperturbative color-composite long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs), as well as from perturbative hard-scattering (H-MHOUs) and fragmentation-scale inputs (F-MHOUs), assessed separately and in combination. To support phenomenology, we compute NLL/NLO$^+$ cross sections for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC within the hybrid collinear and high-energy factorization (HyF) as implemented in (sym)JETHAD, incorporating angular multiplicities as key observables sensitive to high-energy QCD dynamics. We also provide expected event yields based on realistic luminosity scenarios, offering a concrete benchmark for experimental searches. This work connects the investigation of exotic hadrons with state-of-the-art precision QCD.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of the Longitudinal Momentum-Transfer Component and Kinematic Factors in a diffraction approach for H(d,p)X Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of the Glauber-Sitenko approximation, an analysis of the differential cross section for deuteron breakup into a proton in the reaction H(d,p)X is presented. The study is carried out using various parameterizations of the deuteron wave function, including the single-Gaussian parametrization, the multi-Gaussian K2 parametrization, and models based on the Av18 and NijmI nucleon-nucleon potentials. Special attention is given to the effects of small longitudinal components of the transferred momentum (Qz &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) and the transverse momentum of the proton-neutron pair (p_perp &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) in the anti-laboratory reference frame. The results are compared with experimental data, particularly in the region of longitudinal momenta p\_3 = 0.25-0.5 GeV/c, where quark effects are expected to manifest. Preliminary estimates show a decrease in the cross section with increasing transverse momentum, as well as a relatively small shift (and growth) of the cross-section maximum due to the inclusion of the longitudinal component Qz.</description>
