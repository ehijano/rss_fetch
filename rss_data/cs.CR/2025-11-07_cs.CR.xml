      <title>Temporal Analysis Framework for Intrusion Detection Systems: A Novel Taxonomy for Time-Aware Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most intrusion detection systems still identify attacks only after significant damage has occurred, detecting late-stage tactics rather than early indicators of compromise. This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework and taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic review of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS methods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to multi-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow sequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal coverage across MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance through Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely used datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress toward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for developing IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber threats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Just in Plain Sight: Unveiling CSAM Distribution Campaigns on the Clear Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Child sexual abuse is among the most hideous crimes, yet, after the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a huge surge in the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Traditionally, the exchange of such material is performed on the dark web, as it provides many privacy guarantees that facilitate illicit trades. However, the introduction of end-to-end encryption platforms has brought it to the deep web. In this work, we report our findings for a campaign of spreading child sexual abuse material on the clear web. The campaign utilized at least 1,026 web pages for at least 738,286 registered users. Our analysis details the operation of such a campaign, showcasing how social networks are abused and the role of bots, but also the bypasses that are used. Going a step further and exploiting operational faults in the campaign, we gain insight into the demand for such content, as well as the dynamics of the user network that supports it.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Agentic AI Communication Protocols: A Comparative Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly foundational to complex, distributed workflows. Yet, the security of their underlying communication protocols remains critically under-examined. This paper presents the first empirical, comparative security analysis of the official CORAL implementation and a high-fidelity, SDK-based ACP implementation, benchmarked against a literature-based evaluation of A2A. Using a 14 point vulnerability taxonomy, we systematically assess their defenses across authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Our results reveal a pronounced security dichotomy: CORAL exhibits a robust architectural design, particularly in its transport-layer message validation and session isolation, but suffers from critical implementation-level vulnerabilities, including authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway. Conversely, ACP's architectural flexibility, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into high-impact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these findings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing protocols remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines CORAL's integrated architecture with ACP's mandatory per-message integrity guarantees, laying the groundwork for resilient, next-generation agent communications.</description>

      <title>Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code, but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

      <title>Design and Detection of Covert Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks on Water Treatment Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness, underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial control environments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fuzzing with LLM-Guided Input Mutation and Semantic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness, leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution, I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++, combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets, including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate and deepen vulnerability discovery.</description>

      <title>Automated and Explainable Denial of Service Analysis for AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks, offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Region-Adaptive Differential Privacy Framework for Image Pixelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability, and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity, leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.</description>

      <title>Data Certification Strategies for Blockchain-based Traceability Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of blockchains for data certification and traceability is now well established in both the literature and practical applications. However, while blockchain-based certification of individual data is clear and straightforward, the use of blockchain to certify large amounts of data produced on a nearly continuous basis still poses some challenges. In such a case, in fact, it is first necessary to collect the data in an off-chain buffer, and then to organize it, e.g., via Merkle trees, in order to keep the size and quantity of certification data to be written to the blockchain small. In this paper, we consider a typical system for blockchain-based traceability of a production process, and propose and comparatively analyze some strategies for certifying the data of such a process on blockchain, while maintaining the possibility of verifying their certification in a decentralized way.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust and Interpretable Magecart Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied, further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to distinguish between benign and malicious scripts. Such models are supported by a Behavior Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) which captures structural behavior patterns in scripts, helping to analyze and classify client-side script execution logs. To ensure robustness against adversarial evasion attacks, the ML models were adversarially trained and evaluated using attacks from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox and the Adaptative Perturbation Pattern Method. In addition, concise explanations of ML model decisions are provided, supporting transparency and user trust. Experimental validation demonstrated high detection performance and interpretable reasoning, demonstrating that traditional ML models can be effective in real-world web security contexts.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Structures for Bypassing and Crashing Anti-Malware Solutions via Telemetry Complexity Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-malware systems rely on sandboxes, hooks, and telemetry pipelines, including collection agents, serializers, and database backends, to monitor program and system behavior. We show that these data-handling components constitute an exploitable attack surface that can lead to denial-of-analysis (DoA) states without disabling sensors or requiring elevated privileges. As a result, we present \textit{Telemetry Complexity Attacks} (TCAs), a new class of vulnerabilities that exploit fundamental mismatches between unbounded collection mechanisms and bounded processing capabilities. Our method recursively spawns child processes to generate specially crafted, deeply nested, and oversized telemetry that stresses serialization and storage boundaries, as well as visualization layers, for example, JSON/BSON depth and size limits. Depending on the product, this leads to truncated or missing behavioral reports, rejected database inserts, serializer recursion and size errors, and unresponsive dashboards. In all of these cases, malicious activity is normally executed; however, depending on the examined solution, it is not recorded and/or not presented to the analysts. Therefore, instead of evading sensors, we break the pipeline that stores the data captured by the sensors.
  We evaluate our technique against twelve commercial and open-source malware analysis platforms and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Seven products fail in different stages of the telemetry pipeline; two vendors assigned CVE identifiers (CVE-2025-61301 and CVE-2025-61303), and others issued patches or configuration changes. We discuss root causes and propose mitigation strategies to prevent DoA attacks triggered by adversarial telemetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the integration off Large Language Models into cybersecurity tools and protocols. The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.</description>

      <title>Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

      <title>How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models, systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics. Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis, contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model (NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.</description>

      <title>Specification-Guided Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code understanding tasks. However, they demonstrate limited performance in vulnerability detection and struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from patched code. We argue that LLMs lack understanding of security specifications -- the expectations about how code should behave to remain safe. When code behavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability. However, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models unable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a specification-guided approach that systematically extracts security specifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct constructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General specifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental safe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated violations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct retrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about expected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate VulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid reasoning. On PrimeVul, VulInstruct achieves 45.0% F1-score (32.7% improvement) and 37.7% recall (50.8% improvement) compared to baselines, while uniquely detecting 24.3% of vulnerabilities -- 2.4x more than any baseline. In pair-wise evaluation, VulInstruct achieves 32.3% relative improvement. VulInstruct also discovered a previously unknown high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-56538) in production code, demonstrating practical value for real-world vulnerability discovery. All code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/zhuhaopku/VulInstruct-temp.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Adaptive Source-Sink Identification and False Positive Mitigation for Static Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static analysis is effective for discovering software vulnerabilities but notoriously suffers from incomplete source--sink specifications and excessive false positives (FPs). We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism.
  We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by \textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability analysis. </description>

      <title>List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes Over Galois Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: List decoding of codes can be seen as the generalization of unique decoding of codes While list decoding over finite fields has been extensively studied, extending these results to more general algebraic structures such as Galois rings remains an important challenge. Due to recent progress in zero knowledge systems, there is a growing demand to investigate the proximity gap of codes over Galois rings in Yizhou Yao and coauthors(2025), Alexander Golovne and coauthors(2023), Yuanju Wei and coauthors(2025). The proximity gap is closely related to the decoding capability of codes. It was shown in Eli Ben-Sasson and coauthors(2020) that the proximity gap for RS codes over finite field can be improved to $1-\sqrt{r}$ if one consider list decoding instead of unique decoding. However, we know very little about RS codes over Galois ring which might hinder the development of zero knowledge proof system for ring-based arithmetic circuit. In this work, we first extend the list decoding procedure of Guruswami and Sudan to Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings, which shows that RS codes with rate $r$ can be list decoded up to radius $1-\sqrt{r}$. Then, we investigate the list decoding of folded Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings. We show that the list decoding radius of folded Reed-Solomon codes can reach the Singlton bound as its counterpart over finite field. Finally, we improve the list size of our folded Reed-Solomon code to $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ by extending recent work in Shashank Srivastava(2025) to Galois Rings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>Space-Bounded Communication Complexity of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study space-bounded communication complexity for unitary implementation in distributed quantum processors, where we restrict the number of qubits per processor to ensure practical relevance and technical non-triviality. We model distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal two-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the minimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we improve upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$ pairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas), we prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\left(\max\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m}, n\}\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the tightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation models and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show that both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit linear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model, outperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the approximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from linear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound. These results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private In-Context Learning with Nearest Neighbor Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning. However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Tight Analysis of a Grover-based Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secret-sharing schemes allow a dealer to split a secret into multiple "shares" and distribute them individually among many parties while mandating certain constraints on its reconstruction. Such protocols are usually executed over a secure communication channel since an eavesdropper, after intercepting all the shares, is expected to be able to reconstruct the secret. Leveraging the unique properties of quantum channels, several quantum protocols have been designed for secret sharing. However, almost all of them detect the presence of an eavesdropper by statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple rounds, or simply require a secure channel of communication.
  We present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security properties of a quantum-search based secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu (2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Our characterisation allowed us to improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping. However, we prove that complete security against an eavesdropper is not possible in this framework.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Cryptography in Linear Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically, this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to decohere, persistent quantum memory will likely be one of the most challenging resources for quantum computers. As such, it will be important to minimize persistent memory in quantum protocols.
  In this work, we consider the case of one-shot signatures (OSS), and more general quantum signing tokens. These are important unclonable primitives, where quantum signing keys allow for signing a single message but not two. Naturally, these quantum signing keys would require storage in long-term quantum memory. Very recently, the first OSS was constructed in a classical oracle model and also in the standard model, but we observe that the quantum memory required for these protocols is quite large. In this work, we significantly decrease the quantum secret key size, in some cases achieving asymptotically optimal size. To do so, we develop novel techniques for proving the security of cryptosystems using coset states, which are one of the main tools used in unclonable cryptography.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel black-box jailbreaking framework that integrates multiple LLM-as-Attacker strategies to deliver highly transferable and effective attacks. The framework is grounded in three key insights from prior jailbreaking research and practice: ensemble approaches outperform single methods in exposing aligned LLM vulnerabilities, malicious instructions vary in jailbreaking difficulty requiring tailored optimization, and disrupting semantic coherence of malicious prompts can manipulate their embeddings to boost success rates. Validated in the Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, our solution achieved top rankings in the Jailbreaking Attack Track.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized smart contracts enable trustless collaboration but suffer from limited privacy and scalability, which hinders broader adoption. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based off-chain execution frameworks offer a promising solution to both issues. Although TEE-based frameworks have made significant progress, prior work has yet to fully explore contract interoperability, a critical foundation for building complex real-world decentralized applications. This paper identifies the key challenges impeding such interoperability and presents practical solutions. Based on these insights, we introduce RaceTEE, a novel framework that leverages off-chain TEE-enabled nodes to efficiently execute confidential, long-lived smart contracts with interactions of arbitrary complexity among contracts. We implement a RaceTEE prototype using Intel SGX, integrate it with Ethereum, and release it as open source. Evaluation across diverse use cases demonstrates its practicality and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SynFuzz: Leveraging Fuzzing of Netlist to Detect Synthesis Bugs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit (IC) design, the increasing complexity of modern processors and intellectual property (IP) cores has introduced new challenges in ensuring design correctness and security. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing techniques have shown their efficacy in detecting hardware bugs and vulnerabilities at the RTL abstraction level of hardware. However, they suffer from several limitations, including an inability to address vulnerabilities introduced during synthesis and gate-level transformations. These methods often fail to detect issues arising from library adversaries, where compromised or malicious library components can introduce backdoors or unintended behaviors into the design. In this paper, we present a novel hardware fuzzer, SynFuzz, designed to overcome the limitations of existing hardware fuzzing frameworks. SynFuzz focuses on fuzzing hardware at the gate-level netlist to identify synthesis bugs and vulnerabilities that arise during the transition from RTL to the gate-level. We analyze the intrinsic hardware behaviors using coverage metrics specifically tailored for the gate-level. Furthermore, SynFuzz implements differential fuzzing to uncover bugs associated with EDA libraries. We evaluated SynFuzz on popular open-source processors and IP designs, successfully identifying 7 new synthesis bugs. Additionally, by exploiting the optimization settings of EDA tools, we performed a compromised library mapping attack (CLiMA), creating a malicious version of hardware designs that remains undetectable by traditional verification methods. We also demonstrate how SynFuzz overcomes the limitations of the industry-standard formal verification tool, Cadence Conformal, providing a more robust and comprehensive approach to hardware verification.</description>

      <title>Rollbaccine : Herd Immunity against Storage Rollback Attacks in TEEs [Technical Report]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, users can "lift-and-shift" unmodified applications into modern, VM-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in order to gain hardware-based security guarantees. However, TEEs do not protect applications against disk rollback attacks, where persistent storage can be reverted to an earlier state after a crash; existing rollback resistance solutions either only support a subset of applications or require code modification. Our key insight is that restoring disk consistency after a rollback attack guarantees rollback resistance for any application. We present Rollbaccine, a device mapper that provides automatic rollback resistance for all applications by provably preserving disk consistency. Rollbaccine intercepts and replicates writes to disk, restores lost state from backups during recovery, and minimizes overheads by taking advantage of the weak, multi-threaded semantics of disk operations. Rollbaccine performs on-par with state-of-the-art, non-automatic rollback resistant solutions; in fact, across benchmarks over PostgreSQL, HDFS, and two file systems (ext4 and xfs), Rollbaccine adds only 19% overhead, except for the fsync-heavy Filebench Varmail.</description>

      <title>VERA: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness, achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>CryptPEFT: Efficient and Private Neural Network Inference via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Publicly available large pretrained models (i.e., backbones) and lightweight adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have become standard components in modern machine learning pipelines. However, preserving the privacy of both user inputs and fine-tuned adapters -- often trained on sensitive data -- during inference remains a significant challenge. Applying cryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation (MPC), to PEFT settings still incurs substantial encrypted computation across both the backbone and adapter, mainly due to the inherent two-way communication between them. To address this limitation, we propose CryptPEFT, the first PEFT solution specifically designed for private inference scenarios. CryptPEFT introduces a novel one-way communication (OWC) architecture that confines encrypted computation solely to the adapter, significantly reducing both computational and communication overhead. To maintain strong model utility under this constraint, we explore the design space of OWC-compatible adapters and employ an automated architecture search algorithm to optimize the trade-off between private inference efficiency and model utility. We evaluated CryptPEFT using Vision Transformer backbones across widely used image classification datasets. Our results show that CryptPEFT significantly outperforms existing baselines, delivering speedups ranging from $20.62\times$ to $291.48\times$ in simulated wide-area network (WAN) and local-area network (LAN) settings. On CIFAR-100, CryptPEFT attains 85.47% accuracy with just 2.26 seconds of inference latency. These findings demonstrate that CryptPEFT offers an efficient and privacy-preserving solution for modern PEFT-based inference.</description>

      <title>Impossibility Results of Card-Based Protocols via Mathematical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces mathematical optimization as a new method for proving impossibility results in the field of card-based cryptography. While previous impossibility proofs were often limited to cases involving a small number of cards, this new approach establishes results that hold for a large number of cards. The research focuses on single-cut full-open (SCFO) protocols, which consist of performing one random cut and then revealing all cards. The main contribution is that for any three-variable Boolean function, no new SCFO protocols exist beyond those already known, under the condition that all additional cards have the same color. The significance of this work is that it provides a new framework for proving impossibility results and delivers a proof that is valid for any number of cards, as long as all additional cards have the same color.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Security of Mobile LLM Agents under Adversarial Prompts from Untrusted Third-Party Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</description>

      <title>PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</description>

      <title>PrivyWave: Privacy-Aware Wireless Sensing of Heartbeat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar, unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations (120{\deg} field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in pervasive health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes are released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.</description>

      <title>GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</description>

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Breaking Data Silos: Towards Open and Scalable Mobility Foundation Models via Generative Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL.</description>

Abstract: Following Hoare's seminal invention, later called Hoare logic, to reason about correctness of computer programs, we advocate a related but fundamentally different approach to reason about access security of computer programs such as access control. We define the formalism, which we denote access Hoare logic, and present examples which demonstrate its usefulness and fundamental difference to Hoare logic. We prove soundness and completeness of access Hoare logic, and provide a link between access Hoare logic and standard Hoare logic.</description>
