      <title>An Efficient Method for Solving Lane Emden Equation using Legendre Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this manuscript is to address non-linear differential equations of the Lane Emden equation of second order using the shifted Legendre neural network (SLNN) method. Here all the equations are classified as singular initial value problems. To manage the singularity challenge, we employ an artificial neural network method. The approach utilizes a neural network of a single layer, where the hidden layer is omitted by enlarge the input using shifted Legendre polynomials. We apply a feed forward neural network model along with the principle of error back propagation. The effectiveness of the Legendre Neural Network model is demonstrated through LaneEmden equations.</description>

      <title>Barycentric interpolation formulas for the sphere and the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical and polar geometries arise in many important areas of computational science, including weather and climate forecasting, optics, and astrophysics. In these applications, tensor-product grids are often used to represent unknowns. However, interpolation schemes that exploit the tensor-product structure can introduce artificial boundaries at the poles in spherical coordinates and at the origin in polar coordinates, leading to numerical challenges, especially for high-order methods. In this paper, we present new bivariate trigonometric barycentric interpolation formulas for spheres and bivariate trigonometric/polynomial barycentric formulas for disks, designed to overcome these issues. These formulas are also efficient, as they only rely on a set of (precomputed) weights that depend on the grid structure and not the data itself. The formulas are based on the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method, which transforms the sphere into a doubly periodic domain and the disk into a domain without an artificial boundary at the origin. For standard tensor-product grids, the proposed formulas exhibit exponential convergence when approximating smooth functions. We provide numerical results to demonstrate these convergence rates and showcase an application of the spherical barycentric formulas in a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme for solving the tracer transport equation on the sphere.</description>

      <title>High-Order Spectral Simulation of Dispersive Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past twenty years, the field of plasmonics has been revolutionized with the isolation and utilization of two--dimensional materials, particularly graphene. Consequently there is significant interest in rapid, robust, and highly accurate computational schemes which can incorporate such materials. Standard volumetric approaches can be contemplated, but these require huge computational resources. Here we describe an algorithm which addresses this issue for nonlocal models of the electromagnetic response of graphene. Our methodology not only approximates the graphene layer with a surface current, but also reformulates the governing volumetric equations in terms of surface quantities using Dirichlet--Neumann Operators. We have recently shown how these surface equations can be numerically simulated in an efficient, stable, and accurate fashion using a High--Order Perturbation of Envelopes methodology. We extend these results to the nonlocal model mentioned above, and using an implementation of this algorithm, we study absorbance spectra of TM polarized plane--waves scattered by a periodic grid of graphene ribbons.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Reconstruction Method for Arbitrary High-Order Accuracy Using Discontinuity Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an effcient class of adaptive stencil extension reconstruction methods based on a discontinuity feedback factor, addressing the challenges of weak robustness and high computational cost in high-order schemes, particularly those of 7th-order or above. Two key innovations are presented: The accuracy order adaptively increases from the lowest level based on local stencil smoothness, contrasting with conventional methods like Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) and Monotonic Upstream-Centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL)limiters, which typically reduce order from the highest level. The Discontinuity Feedback Factor (DF) serves a dual purpose: detecting sub-cell discontinuity strength and explicitly incorporating into the reconstruction process as a local smoothness measure. This approach eliminates the need for computationally expensive smoothness indicators often required in very high-order schemes, such as 9th-order schemes, and can be easily generalized to arbitrary high-order schemes. Rigorous test cases, including a Mach 20000 jet, demonstrate the exceptional robustness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Training Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with Implicit Single-Step Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are pervasive in many science and engineering fields, yet standard neural ODE approaches struggle to learn them. This limitation is the main barrier to the widespread adoption of neural ODEs. In this paper, we propose an approach based on single-step implicit schemes to enable neural ODEs to handle stiffness and demonstrate that our implicit neural ODE method can learn stiff dynamics. This work addresses a key limitation in current neural ODE methods, paving the way for their use in a wider range of scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Positivity-preserving truncated Euler and Milstein methods for financial SDEs with super-linear coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two variants of the positivity-preserving schemes, namely the truncated Euler-Maruyama (EM) method and the truncated Milstein scheme, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with positive solutions and super-linear coefficients. Under some regularity and integrability assumptions we derive the optimal strong convergence rates of the two schemes. Moreover, we demonstrate flexibility of our approaches by applying the truncated methods to approximate SDEs with super-linear coefficients (3/2 and Ai{\i}t-Sahalia models) directly and also with sub-linear coefficients (CIR model) indirectly. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Numerical Algorithms for the Reconstruction of Space-Dependent Sources in Thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse problems of determining a space-dependent source for thermoelastic systems of type III under adequate time-averaged or final-in-time measurements and conditions on the time-dependent part of the sought source. Several numerical methods are proposed and examined, including a Landweber scheme and minimisation methods for the corresponding cost functionals, which are based on the gradient and conjugate gradient method. A shortcoming of these methods is that the values of the sought source are fixed ab initio and remain fixed during the iterations. The Sobolev gradient method is applied to overcome the possible inaccessibility of the source values at the boundary. Numerical examples are presented to discuss the different approaches and support our findings based on the implementation on the FEniCSx platform.</description>

      <title>A fourth-order, multigrid cut-cell method for solving Poisson's equation in three-dimensional irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fourth-order cut-cell method for solving Poisson's equations in three-dimensional irregular domains. Major distinguishing features of our method include (a) applicable to arbitrarily complex geometries, (b) high order discretization, (c) optimal complexity. Feature (a) is achieved by Yin space, which is a mathematical model for three-dimensional continua. Feature (b) is accomplished by poised lattice generation (PLG) algorithm, which finds stencils near the irregular boundary for polynomial fitting. Besides, for feature (c), we design a modified multigrid solver whose complexity is theoretically optimal by applying nested dissection (ND) ordering method.</description>

      <title>On implicit time methods and discontinuous Galerkin space reconstruction for conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many physical scenarios governed by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, stiffness necessitates small time-steps due to the stringent CFL stability criterion. Implicit time integration schemes leverage superior stability properties enabling the selection of time-steps based solely on accuracy requirements, thereby bypassing the need for minute time-steps. In this work, we consider high-order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta time integration methods coupled with discontinuous Galerkin space reconstructions for stiff hyperbolic systems. We analyze dispersion-diffusion properties to select the best combination of the space-time discretization for high Courant numbers, in terms of controlling spurious oscillations. Working with high-order methods, however, requires to introduce local space limiters which make the whole implicit scheme highly nonlinear. Therefore, we propose to use appropriate space limiters that can be precomputed on a first-order predictor of the solution. This approach follows the methodology proposed by Puppo et al. (Commun. Comput. Phys., 2024) for high-order finite volume schemes. Numerical experiments involve both scalar equations and systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solution of State-Constrained Distributed Parabolic Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a space-time finite element method for the numerical solution of a distributed tracking-type optimal control problem subject to the heat equation with state constraints. The cost or regularization term is formulated in an anisotropic Sobolev norm for the state, and the optimal state is then characterized as the unique solution of a first kind variational inequality. We discuss an efficient realization of the anisotropic Sobolev norm in the case of a space-time tensor-product finite element mesh, and the iterative solution of the resulting discrete variational inequality by means of a semi-smooth Newton method, i.e., using an active set strategy.</description>

      <title>Seepage analysis and control of the Sahand rockfill dam drainage using instrumental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite element method is an effective numerical method for accurate analysis of seepage that can determine the values of outlet flow and pore water pressures at any point of the body and the foundation. In the present study, the seepage analysis of Sahand Dam has been performed using finite element method and PLAXIS software and the dam has been validated by instrumental data's. After validation, permeability coefficients have been used to investigate the factors affecting seepage in the normal level of the reservoir such as cutoff wall, upstream concrete cover, clay blanket and the effect of foundation depth. Results show that the implementation of clay blanket with concrete cover of upstream together, causes a significant decrease in discharge of the dam. Finally, by investigating the effective parameters on the dam seepage, a complex optimum model was developed. In the mentioned model, discharge amount was decreased to one over third of the corresponding value of the initial dam model.</description>

      <title>Locally energy-stable finite element schemes for incompressible flow problems: Design and analysis for equal-order interpolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that finite element discretizations of incompressible flow problems can be designed to ensure preservation/dissipation of kinetic energy not only globally but also locally. In the context of equal-order (piecewise-linear) interpolations, we prove the validity of a semi-discrete energy inequality for a quadrature-based approximation to the nonlinear convective term, which we combine with the Becker--Hansbo pressure stabilization. An analogy with entropy-stable algebraic flux correction schemes for the compressible Euler equations and the shallow water equations yields a weak `bounded variation' estimate from which we deduce the semi-discrete Lax--Wendroff consistency and convergence towards dissipative weak solutions. The results of our numerical experiments for standard test problems confirm that the method under investigation is non-oscillatory and exhibits optimal convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Variational Schemes on Bounded and Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learnable variational scheme using Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) is presented and used to approximate linear problems on bounded and unbounded domains. In contrast to standard mesh-free methods, which use GRBFs to discretize strong-form differential equations, this work exploits the relationship between integrals of GRBFs, their derivatives, and polynomial moments to produce exact quadrature formulae which enable weak-form expressions. Combined with trainable GRBF means and covariances, this leads to a flexible, generalized Galerkin variational framework which is applied in the infinite-domain setting where the scheme is conforming, as well as the bounded-domain setting where it is not. Error rates for the proposed GRBF scheme are derived in each case, and examples are presented demonstrating utility of this approach as a surrogate modeling technique.</description>

      <title>Using Crank-Nikolson Scheme to Solve the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is a fundamental partial differential equation that models wave propagation in shallow water and other dispersive media. Accurately solving the KdV equation is essential for understanding wave dynamics in physics and engineering applications. This project focuses on implementing the Crank-Nicolson scheme, a finite difference method known for its stability and accuracy, to solve the KdV equation. The Crank-Nicolson scheme's implicit nature allows for a more stable numerical solution, especially in handling the dispersive and nonlinear terms of the KdV equation. We investigate the performance of the scheme through various test cases, analyzing its convergence and error behavior. The results demonstrate that the Crank-Nicolson method provides a robust approach for solving the KdV equation, with improved accuracy over traditional explicit methods. Code is available at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Training Difficulty and Accelerating Convergence in Neural Network-Based PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in scientific and engineering applications, particularly when handling complex domains or incorporating empirical data. These methods leverage neural networks as basis functions to approximate PDE solutions. However, training such networks can be challenging, often resulting in limited accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the training dynamics of neural network-based PDE solvers with a focus on the impact of initialization techniques. We assess training difficulty by analyzing the eigenvalue distribution of the kernel and apply the concept of effective rank to quantify this difficulty, where a larger effective rank correlates with faster convergence of the training error. Building upon this, we discover through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments that two initialization techniques, partition of unity (PoU) and variance scaling (VS), enhance the effective rank, thereby accelerating the convergence of training error. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments using popular PDE-solving frameworks, such as PINN, Deep Ritz, and the operator learning framework DeepOnet, confirm that these initialization techniques consistently speed up convergence, in line with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision sketching for least-squares problems and its application in GMRES-based iterative refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketching-based preconditioners have been shown to accelerate the solution of dense least-squares problems with coefficient matrices having substantially more rows than columns. The cost of generating these preconditioners can be reduced by employing low precision floating-point formats for all or part of the computations. We perform finite precision analysis of a mixed precision algorithm that computes the $R$-factor of a QR factorization of the sketched coefficient matrix. Two precisions can be chosen and the analysis allows understanding how to set these precisions to exploit the potential benefits of low precision formats and still guarantee an effective preconditioner. If the nature of the least-squares problem requires a solution with a small forward error, then mixed precision iterative refinement (IR) may be needed. For ill-conditioned problems the GMRES-based IR approach can be used, but good preconditioner is crucial to ensure convergence. We theoretically show when the sketching-based preconditioner can guarantee that the GMRES-based IR reduces the relative forward error of the least-squares solution and the residual to the level of the working precision unit roundoff. Small numerical examples illustrate the analysis.</description>

      <title>A Banach space formulation for the fully dynamic Navier-Stokes-Biot coupled problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a fully-mixed formulation for the coupled problem arising in the interaction between a free fluid and a poroelastic medium. The flows in the free fluid and poroelastic regions are governed by the Navier-Stokes and Biot equations, respectively, and the transmission conditions are given by mass conservation, balance of stresses, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law. We apply dual-mixed formulations in both Navier-Stokes and Darcy equations, where the symmetry of the Navier-Stokes pseudostress tensor is imposed in a weak sense and a displacement-based formulation for elasticity equation. In turn, since the transmission conditions are essential in the fully mixed formulation, they are imposed weakly by introducing the traces of the fluid velocity and the poroelastic medium pressure on the interface as the associated Lagrange multipliers. Existence and uniqueness of a solution are established for the continuous weak formulation, as well as a semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation with nonmatching grids, in a Banach space setting, employing classical results on monotone and nonlinear operators and a regularization technique together with the Banach fixed point approach. We then present error analysis with corresponding rates of convergence for semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical rates of convergence and illustrate the performance of the method for application to flow through a filter.</description>

      <title>Long-time stable SAV-BDF2 numerical schemes for the forced Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable time-marching scheme for the forced Navier-Stokes equations. A new Forced Scalar Auxiliary Variable approach (FSAV) is introduced to preserve the underlying dissipative structure of the forced system that yields a uniform-in-time estimate of the numerical solution. In addition, the numerical scheme is autonomous if the underlying model is, laying the foundation for studying long-time dynamics of the numerical solution via dynamical system approach. As an example we apply the new algorithm to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the case with no-penetration and free-slip boundary condition on a simply connected domain, we are also able to derive a uniform-in-time estimate of the vorticity in $H^1$ norm in addition to the $L^2$ norm guaranteed by the general framework. Numerical results demonstrate superior performance of the new algorithm in terms of accuracy, efficiency, stability and robustness.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of an Enhanced Finite Element Method for Mani\`a's Problem Exhibiting the Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that numerically approximating calculus of variations problems possessing a Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon (LGP) is challenging, and the standard numerical methodologies such as finite element, finite difference, and discontinuous Galerkin methods fail to give convergent methods because they cannot overcome the gap. This paper is a continuation of a 2018 paper by Feng-Schnake, where a promising enhanced finite element method was proposed to overcome the LGP in the classical Mani\`a's problem. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete $\Gamma$-convergence proof for this enhanced finite element method, hence establishing a theoretical foundation for the method. The crux of the convergence analysis is the construction of a new finite element interpolant that helps to build a recovery sequence for proving a $\Gamma$-convergence result due to its strong approximation properties in Sobolev spaces. Numerical tests are also provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An efficient proximal-based approach for solving nonlocal Allen-Cahn equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient approach for the spatial and temporal discretization of the nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation, which incorporates various double-well potentials and an integrable kernel, with a particular focus on a non-smooth obstacle potential. While nonlocal models offer enhanced flexibility for complex phenomena, they often lead to increased computational costs and there is a need to design efficient spatial and temporal discretization schemes, especially in the non-smooth setting. To address this, we propose first- and second-order energy-stable time-stepping schemes combined with the Fourier collocation approach for spatial discretization. We provide energy stability estimates for the developed time-stepping schemes. A key aspect to our approach involves a representation of a solution via proximal operators. This together with the spatial and temporal discretizations enables direct evaluation of the solution that can bypass the solution of nonlinear, non-smooth, and nonlocal system. This method significantly improves computational efficiency, especially in the case of non-smooth obstacle potentials, and facilitates rapid solution evaluations in both two and three dimensions. We provide several numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Average energy dissipation rates of additive implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for gradient flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified theoretical framework is suggested to examine the energy dissipation properties at all stages of additive implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IERK) methods up to fourth-order accuracy for gradient flow problems. We construct some parameterized IERK methods by applying the so-called first same as last method, that is, the diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method with the explicit first stage and stiffly-accurate assumption for the linear stiff term, and applying the explicit Runge-Kutta method for the nonlinear term. The main part of the novel framework is to construct the differential forms and the associated differentiation matrices of IERK methods by using the difference coefficients of method and the so-called discrete orthogonal convolution kernels. As the main result, we prove that an IERK method can preserve the original energy dissipation law unconditionally if the associated differentiation matrix is positive semi-definite. The recent indicator, namely average energy dissipation rate, is also adopted for these multi-stage methods to evaluate the overall energy dissipation rate of an IERK method such that one can choose proper parameters in some parameterized IERK methods. It is found that the selection of method parameters in the IERK methods is at least as important as the selection of different IERK methods. Extensive numerical experiments are also included to support our theory.</description>

      <title>Complete pivoting growth of butterfly matrices and butterfly Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth problem in Gaussian elimination (GE) remains a foundational question in numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra. Wilkinson resolved the growth problem in GE with partial pivoting (GEPP) in his initial analysis from the 1960s, while he was only able to establish an upper bound for the GE with complete pivoting (GECP) growth problem. The GECP growth problem has seen a spike in recent interest, culminating in improved lower and upper bounds established by Bisain, Edelman, and Urschel in 2023, but still remains far from being fully resolved. Due to the complex dynamics governing the location of GECP pivots, analysis of GECP growth for particular input matrices often estimates the actual growth rather than computes the growth exactly. We present a class of dense random butterfly matrices on which we can present the exact GECP growth. We extend previous results that established exact growth computations for butterfly matrices when using GEPP and GE with rook pivoting (GERP) to now also include GECP for particular input matrices. Moreover, we present a new method to construct random Hadamard matrices using butterfly matrices.</description>

      <title>CholeskyQR for sparse matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CholeskyQR is an efficient algorithm for QR factorization with several advantages compared with orhter algorithms. In order to improve its orthogonality, CholeskyQR2 is developed \cite{2014}\cite{error}. To deal with ill-conditioned matrices, a shifted item $s$ is introduced and we have Shifted CholeskyQR3 \cite{Shifted}. In many problems in the industry, QR factorization for sparse matrices is very common, especially for some sparse matrices with special structures. In this work, we discuss the property of CholeskyQR-type algorithms for sparse matrices. We introduce new definitions for the input sparse matrix $X$ and divide them into two types based on column properties. We provide better sufficient conditions for $\kappa_{2}(X)$ and better shifted item $s$ for CholeskyQR-type algorithms under certain element-norm conditiones(ENCs) compared with the original ones in \cite{Shifted}\cite{error}, together with an alternative error analysis for the algorithm. The steps of analysis utilize the properties of the $g$-norm of the matrix which is given in the previous work. Moreover, a new three-step CholeskyQR-type algorithm with two shifted items called 3C is developed for sparse matrices with good orthogonality. We do numerical experiments with some typical real examples to show the advantages of improved algorithms compared with the original ones in the previous works.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary Subdivision Schemes in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary subdivision schemes have been extensively studied and have numerous applications in CAGD and wavelet analysis. To have high-order smoothness of the scheme, it is usually inevitable to enlarge the support of the mask that is used, which is a major difficulty with stationary subdivision schemes due to complicated implementation and dramatically increased special subdivision rules at extraordinary vertices. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a multivariate quasi-stationary subdivision scheme and fully characterize its convergence and smoothness. We will also discuss the general procedure of designing interpolatory masks with short support that yields smooth quasi-stationary subdivision schemes. Specifically, using the dyadic dilation of both triangular and quadrilateral meshes, for each smoothness exponent $m=1,2$, we obtain examples of $C^m$-convergent quasi-stationary $2I_2$-subdivision schemes with bivariate symmetric masks having at most $m$-ring stencils. Our examples demonstrate the advantage of quasi-stationary subdivision schemes, which can circumvent the difficulty above with stationary subdivision schemes.</description>

      <title>Convergence and superconvergence analysis of discontinuous Galerkin methods for index-2 integral-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integral-algebraic equation (IAE) is a mixed system of first-kind and second-kind Volterra integral equations (VIEs). This paper mainly focuses on the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to solve index-2 IAEs. First, the convergence theory of perturbed DG methods for first-kind VIEs is established, and then used to derive the optimal convergence properties of DG methods for index-2 IAEs. It is shown that an $(m-1)$-th degree DG approximation exhibits global convergence of order~$m$ when~$m$ is odd, and of order~$m-1$ when~$m$ is even, for the first component~$x_1$ of the exact solution, corresponding to the second-kind VIE, whereas the convergence order is reduced by two for the second component~$x_2$ of the exact solution, corresponding to the first-kind VIE. Each component also exhibits local superconvergence of one order higher when~$m$ is even. When~$m$ is odd, superconvergence occurs only if $x_1$ satisfies $x_1^{(m)}(0)=0$. Moreover, with this condition, we can extend the local superconvergence result for~$x_2$ to global superconvergence when~$m$ is odd. Note that in the DG method for an index-1 IAE, generally, the global superconvergence of the exact solution component corresponding to the second-kind VIE can only be obtained by iteration. However, we can get superconvergence for all components of the exact solution of the index-2 IAE directly. Some numerical experiments are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to compute efficiently and with arbitrary precision a basis of harmonic functions with prescribed singularities on a general compact surface of genus two and more. This basis is obtained as a composition of theta functions and the Abel-Jacobi map, which is approximated at spectral speed by complex polynomials. We then implement this method to compute harmonic extensions on genus $2$ surfaces with boundary, that are described by their Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and a smooth parametrization of the boundary. Finally, we prove the spectral convergence of the method for the harmonic extension.</description>

      <title>Convergence of spectral discretization for the flow of diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) or flow of diffeomorphism is a classical framework in the field of shape spaces and is widely applied in mathematical imaging and computational anatomy. Essentially, it equips a group of diffeomorphisms with a right-invariant Riemannian metric, which allows to compute (Riemannian) distances or interpolations between different deformations. The associated Euler--Lagrange equation of shortest interpolation paths is one of the standard examples of a partial differential equation that can be approached with Lie group theory (by interpreting it as a geodesic ordinary differential equation on the Lie group of diffeomorphisms). The particular group $\mathcal D^m$ of Sobolev diffeomorphisms is by now sufficiently understood to allow the analysis of geodesics and their numerical approximation. We prove convergence of a widely used Fourier-type space discretization of the geodesic equation. It is based on a new regularity estimate: We prove that geodesics in $\mathcal D^m$ preserve any higher order Sobolev regularity of their initial velocity.</description>

      <title>Learning a generalized multiscale prolongation operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid preconditioners are one of the most powerful techniques for solving large sparse linear systems. In this research, we address Darcy flow problems with random permeability using the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by a two-grid preconditioner based on a generalized multiscale prolongation operator, which has been demonstrated to be stable for high contrast profiles. To circumvent the need for repeatedly solving spectral problems with varying coefficients, we harness deep learning techniques to expedite the construction of the generalized multiscale prolongation operator. Considering linear transformations on multiscale basis have no impact on the performance of the preconditioner, we devise a loss function by the coefficient-based distance between subspaces instead of $l^2$-norm of the difference of the corresponding multiscale bases. We discover that leveraging the inherent symmetry in the local spectral problem can effectively accelerate the neural network training process. In scenarios where training data are limited, we utilize the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion to augment the dataset. Extensive numerical experiments with various types of random coefficient models are exhibited, showing that the proposed method can significantly reduce the time required to generate the prolongation operator while maintaining the original efficiency of the two-grid preconditioner.</description>

      <title>A robust solver for large-scale heat transfer topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale parallel solver, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of solving high-dimensional and high-contrast linear systems in heat transfer topology optimization. The solver incorporates an interpolation technique to accelerate convergence in high-resolution domains, along with a multiscale multigrid preconditioner to handle complex coefficient fields with significant contrast. All modules of the optimization solver are implemented on a high performance computing cluster by the PETSc numerical library. Through a series of numerical investigations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing convergence and robustness during the optimization process, particularly in high-contrast scenarios with resolutions up to $1024^3$. Our performance results indicate that the proposed preconditioner achieves over $2\times$ speedup against the default algebraic multigrid in PETSc for high-contrast cases.</description>

      <title>Application of a Temporal Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Degradation in PEM Water Electrolysis under Dynamic Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is vital for sectors like chemicals and others, driven by the need to reduce carbon emissions. Proton Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) is a key technology for the production of green hydrogen under fluctuating conditions of renewable power sources. However, due to the scarcity of noble metal materials, the stability of the anode catalyst layer under dynamic operating conditions must be better understood. Model-aided investigation approaches are essential due to the back-box nature of the electrochemical system and the high costs of experimental long-term testing. In this work, a temporal multiscale method based on a Heterogeneous technique is applied to reduce the computational effort of simulating long-term degradation, focused on catalyst dissolution. Such an approach characterizes the problem in fast locally periodic processes, influenced by the dynamic operation and slow processes attributed to the gradual degradation of the catalyst layer. A mechanistic model that includes the oxygen evolution reaction, catalyst dissolution and hydrogen permeation from the cathode to the anode side is hypothesized and implemented. The multiscale approach notably reduces computational effort of simulation from hours to mere minutes. This efficiency gain is ascribed to the limited evolution of Slow-Scale variables during each period of time of the Fast-Scale variables. Consequently, simulation of the fast processes is required only until local periodicity is achieved within each Slow-Scale time step. Thus, the developed temporal multiscale approach proves to be highly effective in accelerating parameter estimation and predictive simulation steps, as could be verified through the results of this article. In this way, the method can support systematic model development to describe degradation in PEMWE under dynamic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Subspace method of moments for ab initio 3-D single-particle Cryo-EM reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a widely-used technique for recovering the 3-D structure of biological molecules from a large number of experimentally generated noisy 2-D tomographic projection images of the 3-D structure, taken from unknown viewing angles. Through computationally intensive algorithms, these observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many popular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of the reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low signal-to-noise ratio. The method of moments (MoM) offers an alternative approach that circumvents the estimation of viewing angles of individual projection images by instead estimating the underlying distribution of the viewing angles, and is robust to noise given sufficiently many images. However, the method of moments typically entails computing high-order moments of the projection images, incurring significant storage and computational costs.
  To mitigate this, we propose a new approach called the subspace method of moments (subspace MoM), which compresses the first three moments using data-driven low-rank tensor techniques as well as expansion into a suitable function basis. The compressed moments can be efficiently computed from the set of projection images using numerical quadrature and can be employed to jointly recover the 3-D structure and the distribution of viewing angles. We illustrate the practical applicability of the subspace MoM in numerical experiments using up to the third-order moment, which significantly improves the resolution of MoM reconstructions compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>On the restriction to unitarity for rational approximations to the exponential function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we consider rational best approximations to the exponential function that minimize a uniform error on a subset of the imaginary axis. Namely, Chebyshev approximation and unitary best approximation where the latter is subject to further restriction to unitarity, i.e., requiring that the imaginary axis is mapped to the unit circle. We show that Chebyshev approximants are not unitary, and consequently, distinct to unitary best approximants. However, unitary best approximation attains at most twice the error of Chebyshev approximation, and thus, the restriction to unitarity is not a severe restriction in a practical setting. Moreover, Chebyshev approximation and unitary best approximation attain the same asymptotic error as the underlying domain of approximation shrinks to the origin.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Function Accelerated Iterative Methods for Solving Indefinite Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators, which learn mappings between the function spaces, have been applied to solve boundary value problems in various ways, including learning mappings from the space of the forcing terms to the space of the solutions with the substantial requirements of data pairs. In this work, we present a data-free neural operator integrated with physics, which learns the Green kernel directly. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1. The governing equations for the Green's function are reformulated into an interface problem, where the delta Dirac function is removed; 2. The interface problem is embedded in a lifted space of higher-dimension to handle the jump in the derivative, but still solved on a two-dimensional surface without additional sampling cost; 3. Deep neural networks are employed to address the curse of dimensionality caused by this lifting operation. The approximate Green's function obtained through our approach is then used to construct preconditioners for the linear systems allowed by its mathematical properties. Furthermore, the spectral bias of it revealed through both theoretical analysis and numerical validation contrasts with the smoothing effects of traditional iterative solvers, which motivates us to propose a hybrid iterative method that combines these two solvers. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximate Green's function in accelerating iterative methods, proving fast convergence for solving indefinite problems even involving discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>Neural network solvers for parametrized elasticity problems that conserve linear and angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mixed formulation of parametrized elasticity problems in terms of stress, displacement, and rotation. The latter two variables act as Lagrange multipliers to enforce conservation of linear and angular momentum. Due to the saddle-point structure, the resulting system is computationally demanding to solve directly, and we therefore propose an efficient solution strategy based on a decomposition of the stress variable. First, a triangular system is solved to obtain a stress field that balances the body and boundary forces. Second, a trained neural network is employed to provide a correction without affecting the conservation equations. The displacement and rotation can be obtained by post-processing, if necessary. The potential of the approach is highlighted by three numerical test cases, including a non-linear model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Window Approaches for Direct and Stable STFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval from phaseless short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements is known to be inherently unstable when measurements are taken with respect to a single window. While an explicit inversion formula exists, it is useless in practice due to its instability. In this paper, we overcome this lack of stability by presenting two multi-window approaches that rely on a "good coverage" of the time-frequency plane by the ambiguity functions of the windows. The first is to use the fractional Fourier transform of a dilated Gauss function with various angles as window functions. The essential support of a superposition of the ambiguity function from such window functions is of a "daffodil shape", which converges to a large disc as more angles are used, yielding a much broader coverage in the time-frequency domain. The second approach uses Hermite functions of various degrees as the window functions. The larger the degree, the wider the ambiguity function but with zeros on circles in the time-frequency domain. Combining Hermite functions of different degrees, we can achieve a wide coverage with zeros compensated by the essential support of the ambiguity function from other Hermite windows. Taking advantage of these multi-window procedures, we can stably perform STFT phase retrieval using the direct inversion formula.</description>

      <title>Quadratically-Regularized Distributed Optimal Transport on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport on a graph focuses on finding the most efficient way to transfer resources from one distribution to another while considering the graph's structure. This paper introduces a new distributed algorithm that solves the optimal transport problem on directed, strongly connected graphs, unlike previous approaches which were limited to bipartite graphs. Our algorithm incorporates quadratic regularization and guarantees convergence using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Notably, it proves convergence not only with quadratic regularization but also in cases without it, whereas earlier works required strictly convex objective functions.
  In this approach, nodes are treated as agents that collaborate through local interactions to optimize the total transportation cost, relying only on information from their neighbors. Through numerical experiments, we show how quadratic regularization affects both convergence behavior and solution sparsity under different graph structures. Additionally, we provide a practical example that highlights the algorithm's robustness through its ability to adjust to topological changes in the graph.</description>

      <title>Exact space-time symmetry conservation and automatic mesh refinement for classical lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breaking of space-time symmetries and the non-conservation of the associated Noether charges constitutes a central artifact in lattice field theory. In prior work we have shown how to overcome this limitation for classical actions describing point particle motion, using the world-line formalism of general relativity. The key is to treat coordinate maps (from an abstract parameter space into space-time) as dynamical and dependent degrees of freedom, which remain continuous after discretization of the underlying parameter space. Here we present latest results where we construct a reparameterization invariant classical action for scalar fields, which features dynamical coordinate maps. We highlight the following achievements of our approach: 1) global space-time symmetries remain intact after discretization and the associated Noether charges remain exactly preserved 2) coordinate maps adapt to the dynamics of the scalar field leading to adaptive grid resolution guided by the symmetries.</description>

      <title>A meshless geometric conservation weighted least square method for solving the shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shallow water equations are numerically solved to simulate free surface flows. The convective flux terms in the shallow water equations need to be discretized using a Riemann solver to capture shocks and discontinuity for certain flow situations such as hydraulic jump, dam-break wave propagation or bore wave propagation, levee-breaching flows, etc. The approximate Riemann solver can capture shocks and is popular for studying open-channel flow dynamics with traditional mesh-based numerical methods. Though meshless methods can work on highly irregular geometry without involving the complex mesh generation procedure, the shock-capturing capability has not been implemented, especially for solving open-channel flows. Therefore, we have proposed a numerical method, namely, a shock-capturing meshless geometric conservation weighted least square (GC-WLS) method for solving the shallow water equations. The HLL (Harten-Lax-Van Leer) Riemann solver is implemented within the framework of the proposed meshless method. The spatial derivatives in the shallow water equations and the reconstruction of conservative variables for high-order accuracy are computed using the GC-WLS method. The proposed meshless method is tested for various numerically challenging open-channel flow problems, including analytical, laboratory experiments, and a large-scale physical model study on dam-break event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a decomposition method for solving elliptic boundary value problems in one-dimension. The method is an improvement to an existing technique for approximating elliptic systems. It is demonstrated to be computationally superior to the original formulation as less computations are required to obtain an approximation of the same accuracy. Convergence of the method is justified and supported by some theoretical results. We show that for a sufficiently smooth forcing data, the method always converge for a relatively small truncation order. The method is tested using some problems with exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two efficient and stable algorithms for recovering phase factors in quantum signal processing (QSP), a crucial component of many quantum algorithms. The first algorithm, the ``Half Cholesky" method, which is based on nonlinear Fourier analysis and fast solvers for structured matrices, demonstrates robust performance across all regimes. The second algorithm, ``Fast Fixed Point Iteration," provides even greater efficiency in the non-fully-coherent regime. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of these new methods over all existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: The multi-step inertial randomized Kaczmarz (MIRK) method is an iterative method for solving large-scale linear systems. In this paper, we enhance the MIRK method by incorporating the greedy probability criterion, coupled with the introduction of a tighter threshold parameter for this criterion. We prove that the proposed greedy MIRK (GMIRK) method enjoys an improved deterministic linear convergence compared to both the MIRK method and the greedy randomized Kaczmarz method. Furthermore, we exhibit that the multi-step inertial extrapolation approach can be geometrically interpreted as an orthogonal projection method, and establish its relationship with the sketch-and-project method in (SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 36(4):1660-1690, 2015) and the oblique projection technique in (Results Appl. Math. 16:100342, 2022). Numerical experiments are provided to confirm our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contour-integral-based rational filter leads to interior eigensolvers for non-Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problems. Based on Zolotarev's third problem, this paper proves the asymptotic optimality of the trapezoidal quadrature of the contour integral in terms of the spectrum separation. A composite rule of the trapezoidal quadrature is derived, and two interior eigensolvers are proposed based on it. Both eigensolvers adopt direct factorization and multi-shift generalized minimal residual method for the inner and outer rational functions, respectively. The first eigensolver fixes the order of the outer rational function and applies the subspace iterations to achieve convergence, whereas the second eigensolver doubles the order of the outer rational function every iteration to achieve convergence without subspace iteration. The efficiency and stability of proposed eigensolvers are demonstrated on synthetic and practical sparse matrix pencils.</description>

      <title>A New Matrix Truncation Method for Improving Approximate Factorisation Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this experimental work, we present a general framework based on the Bregman log determinant divergence for preconditioning Hermitian positive definite linear systems. We explore this divergence as a measure of discrepancy between a preconditioner and a matrix. Given an approximate factorisation of a given matrix, the proposed framework informs the construction of a low-rank approximation of the typically indefinite factorisation error. The resulting preconditioner is therefore a sum of a Hermitian positive definite matrix given by an approximate factorisation plus a low-rank matrix. Notably, the low-rank term is not generally obtained as a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD). This framework leads to a new truncation where principal directions are not based on the magnitude of the singular values, and we prove that such truncations are minimisers of the aforementioned divergence. We present several numerical examples showing that the proposed preconditioner can reduce the number of PCG iterations compared to a preconditioner constructed using a TSVD for the same rank. We also propose a heuristic to approximate the proposed preconditioner in the case where exact truncations cannot be computed explicitly (e.g. in a large-scale setting) and demonstrate its effectiveness over TSVD-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalised Adaptive Cross Approximation for Convolution Quadrature based Boundary Element Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acoustic wave equation is solved in time domain with a boundary element formulation. The time discretisation is performed with the generalised convolution quadrature method and for the spatial approximation standard lowest order elements are used. Collocation and Galerkin methods are applied. In the interest of increasing the efficiency of the boundary element method, a low-rank approximation such as the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) is carried out. We discuss about a generalisation of the ACA to approximate a three-dimensional array of data, i.e., usual boundary element matrices at several complex frequencies. This method is used within the generalised convolution quadrature (gCQ) method to obtain a real time domain formulation. The behaviour of the proposed method is studied with three examples, a unit cube, a unit cube with a reentrant corner, and a unit ball. The properties of the method are preserved in the data sparse representation and a significant reduction in storage is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reviews goal-oriented a posteriori error control, adaptivity and solver control for finite element approximations to boundary and initial-boundary value problems for stationary and non-stationary partial differential equations, respectively. In particular, coupled field problems with different physics may require simultaneously the accurate evaluation of several quantities of interest, which is achieved with multi-goal oriented error control. Sensitivity measures are obtained by solving an adjoint problem. Error localization is achieved with the help of a partition-of-unity. We also review and extend theoretical results for efficiency and reliability by employing a saturation assumption. The resulting adaptive algorithms allow to balance discretization and non-linear iteration errors, and are demonstrated for four applications: Poisson's problem, non-linear elliptic boundary value problems, stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and regularized parabolic $p$-Laplace initial-boundary value problems. Therein, different finite element discretizations in two different software libraries are utilized, which are partially accompanied with open-source implementations on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Almost-sure quasi-optimal approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript addresses the problem of approximating an unknown function from point evaluations. When obtaining these point evaluations is costly, minimising the required sample size becomes crucial, and it is unreasonable to reserve a sufficiently large test sample for estimating the approximation accuracy. Therefore, an approximation with a certified quasi-optimality factor is required. This article shows that such an approximation can be obtained when the sought function lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and is to be approximated in a finite-dimensional linear subspace. However, selecting the sample points to minimise the quasi-optimality factor requires optimising over an infinite set of points and computing exact inner products in RKHS, which is often infeasible in practice. Extending results from optimal sampling for $L^2$ approximation, the present manuscript proves that random points, drawn independently from the Christoffel sampling distribution associated with $\mathcal{V}_d$, can yield a controllable quasi-optimality factor with high probability. Inspired by this result, a novel sampling scheme, coined subspace-informed volume sampling, is introduced and evaluated in numerical experiments, where it outperforms classical i.i.d. Christoffel sampling and continuous volume sampling. To reduce the size of such a random sample, an additional greedy subsampling scheme with provable suboptimality bounds is introduced. Our presentation is of independent interest to the community researching the parametrised background data weak (PBDW) method, as it offers a simpler interpretation of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating an unknown function in a nonlinear model class from point evaluations. When obtaining these point evaluations is costly, minimising the required sample size becomes crucial. Recently, an increasing focus has been on employing adaptive sampling strategies to achieve this. These strategies are based on linear spaces related to the nonlinear model class, for which the optimal sampling measures are known. However, the resulting optimal sampling measures depend on an orthonormal basis of the linear space, which is known rarely. Consequently, sampling from these measures is challenging in practice. This manuscript presents a sampling strategy that iteratively refines an estimate of the optimal sampling measure by updating it based on previously drawn samples. This strategy can be performed offline and does not require evaluations of the sought function. We establish convergence and illustrate the practical performance through numerical experiments. Comparing the presented approach with standard Monte Carlo sampling demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of samples required to achieve a good estimation of an orthonormal basis.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for transport models in porous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Fast Fourier-Galerkin Method for Solving Boundary Integral Equations on Torus-Shaped Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a fast Fourier-Galerkin method for solving boundary integral equations on torus-shaped surfaces, which are diffeomorphic to a torus. We analyze the properties of the integral operator's kernel to derive the decay pattern of the entries in the representation matrix. Leveraging this decay pattern, we devise a truncation strategy that efficiently compresses the dense representation matrix of the integral operator into a sparser form containing only $\mathcal{O}(N\ln^2 N)$ nonzero entries, where $N$ denotes the degrees of freedom of the discretization method. We prove that this truncation strategy achieves a quasi-optimal convergence order of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-p/2}\ln N)$, with $p$ representing the degree of regularity of the exact solution to the boundary integral equation. Additionally, we confirm that the truncation strategy preserves stability throughout the solution process. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An improved Shifted CholeskyQR based on columns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shifted CholeskyQR3 is designed to address the QR factorization of ill-conditioned matrices. This algorithm introduces a shift parameter $s$ to prevent failure during the initial Cholesky factorization step. The choice of this shift parameter $s$ is critical for the algorithm's effectiveness. Our goal is to identify a smaller $s$ compared to the traditional selection involving $\|X\|_2$. In this research, we propose a new norm $\|X\|_g$, which is based on the column properties of $X$, to obtain a reduced shift parameter $s$ for the Shifted CholeskyQR3 algorithm. We provide rigorous proofs of orthogonality and residuals for the improved algorithm with our proposed $s$. Numerical experiments confirm the enhanced numerical stability of orthogonality and residuals with the reduced $s$. Furthermore, we compare CPU times with other algorithms to assess performance improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the reconstruction of the shape of an acoustic obstacle. Based on the use of the tapered waves with very narrow widths illuminating the obstacle, the boundary of the obstacle is reconstructed by a direct imaging algorithm. The stability of the imaging scheme is mathematically analyzed. We emphasize that different from the incident plane waves or point sources, the tapered waves with narrow widths bring several benefits in the inverse scattering: 1. local property. A tapered wave can illuminate only on a local part of the boundary of the obstacle, which generates the scattered field; 2. high resolution. We need only reconstruct the boundary near the beam, which improves the quality of some well-known algorithms; 3. fast and easy to implement. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tapered waves.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of a numerical method for the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a robust error estimate for a recently proposed numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$. In particular, if the following two conditions hold: i) there exist a constant $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$, and ii), the singular continuous part of the initial energy measure is zero, then the numerical wave profile converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{\beta}{8}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$.
  Moreover, if $\alpha=0$, then the rate improves to $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{4}})$ without the above assumptions, and we also obtain a convergence rate for the associated energy measure - it converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{2}})$ in the bounded Lipschitz metric. These convergence rates are illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known semi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform of continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability distributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general convergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical spectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously recognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate the computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with applications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The theoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving problems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic function is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be bypassed.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Methods: A Mean Field Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods are widely used for state estimation in the geophysical sciences. Their success stems from the fact that they take an underlying (possibly noisy) dynamical system as a black box to provide a systematic, derivative-free methodology for incorporating noisy, partial and possibly indirect observations to update estimates of the state; furthermore the ensemble approach allows for sensitivities and uncertainties to be calculated. The methodology was introduced in 1994 in the context of ocean state estimation. Soon thereafter it was adopted by the numerical weather prediction community and is now a key component of the best weather prediction systems worldwide. Furthermore the methodology is starting to be widely adopted for numerous problems in the geophysical sciences and is being developed as the basis for general purpose derivative-free inversion methods that show great promise. Despite this empirical success, analysis of the accuracy of ensemble Kalman methods, in terms of their capabilities as both state estimators and quantifiers of uncertainty, is lagging. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unifying mean field based framework for the derivation and analysis of ensemble Kalman methods. Both state estimation and parameter estimation problems (inverse problems) are considered, and formulations in both discrete and continuous time are employed. For state estimation problems, both the control and filtering approaches are considered; analogously for parameter estimation problems, the optimization and Bayesian perspectives are both studied. The mean field perspective provides an elegant framework, suitable for analysis; furthermore, a variety of methods used in practice can be derived from mean field systems by using interacting particle system approximations. The approach taken also unifies a wide-ranging literature in the field and suggests open problems.</description>

Abstract: We guide the reader on a journey through mathematical modeling and numerical analysis, emphasizing the crucial interplay of both disciplines. Targeting undergraduate students with basic knowledge in dynamical systems and numerical methods for ordinary differential equations, we explore a model from mathematical biology where numerical methods fail badly due to catastrophic floating point errors. We analyze the reasons for this behavior by studying the steady states of the model and use the theory of invariants to develop an alternative model that is suited for numerical simulations. Our story intends to motivate combining analytical and numerical knowledge, even in cases where the world looks fine at first sight. We have set up an online repository containing an interactive notebook with all numerical experiments to make this study fully reproducible and useful for classroom teaching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid droplet dynamics are widely used in biological and engineering applications, which contain complex interfacial instabilities and pattern formation such as droplet merging, splitting, and transport. This paper studies a class of mean field control formulations for these droplet dynamics, which can be used to control and manipulate droplets in applications. We first formulate the droplet dynamics as gradient flows of free energies in modified optimal transport metrics with nonlinear mobilities. We then design an optimal control problem for these gradient flows. As an example, a lubrication equation for a thin volatile liquid film laden with an active suspension is developed, with control achieved through its activity field. Lastly, we apply the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm with high-order finite element methods to simulate the proposed mean field control problems. Numerical examples, including droplet formation, bead-up/spreading, transport, and merging/splitting on a two-dimensional spatial domain, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mean field control mechanism.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Are Universal PDE Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits the generalization of neural solvers to diverse PDEs, impeding them from being practical surrogate models for numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE Solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by training a novel Transformer model on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance gains and favorable PDE generalizability.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and foreseeable quantum hardware introduce noise into computations, requiring algorithms that make judicious use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Under these restrictions, variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. A classical device performs nonlinear computations, and a quantum one uses a variational solver for the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. Multigrid preconditioning of the Poisson problem helps avoid local minima and reduces resource requirements for the quantum device. A quantum state readout technique called HTree is used for the first time on a physical problem. Htree is appropriate for real-valued problems and achieves linear complexity in the qubit count, making the Navier-Stokes solve further tractable on current quantum devices. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

      <title>Spectral Informed Neural Network: An Efficient and Low-Memory PINN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>
