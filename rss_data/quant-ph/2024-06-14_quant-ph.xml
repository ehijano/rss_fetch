      <title>FPGA-based Distributed Union-Find Decoder for Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant quantum computer must decode and correct errors faster than they appear to prevent exponential slowdown due to error correction. The Union-Find (UF) decoder is promising with an average time complexity slightly higher than $O(d^3)$. We report a distributed version of the UF decoder that exploits parallel computing resources for further speedup. Using an FPGA-based implementation, we empirically show that this distributed UF decoder has a sublinear average time complexity with regard to $d$, given $O(d^3)$ parallel computing resources. The decoding time per measurement round decreases as $d$ increases, the first time for a quantum error decoder. The implementation employs a scalable architecture called Helios that organizes parallel computing resources into a hybrid tree-grid structure. Using a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA, we successfully implement $d$ up to 21 with an average decoding time of 11.5 ns per measurement round under 0.1\% phenomenological noise, and 23.7 ns for $d=17$ under equivalent circuit-level noise. This performance is significantly faster than any existing decoder implementation. Furthermore, we show that Helios can optimize for resource efficiency by decoding $d=51$ on a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA with an average latency of 544ns per measurement round.</description>

      <title>The observer effect in quantum: the case of classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observer effect in quantum physics states that observation inevitably influences the system being observed. Our proposed epistemic framework treats the observer as an integral part of sensory information processing within entangled quantum systems, highlighting the subjective and probabilistic aspects of observation and inference. Our study introduces a hierarchical model for fuzzy instance classification, which aligns sensory input with an observer's pre-existing beliefs and associated quantum probability-based truth values. Sensory data evolves via interaction with observer states, as described by the Lindblad master equation, and is then classified adaptively using positive operator-valued measures (POVM). Our parametrization employs measures of concurrent similarity and dissimilarity, facilitating perceptual associations and asymmetric cognition. The observer's position on a skeptic-believer spectrum modulates ambiguous matching of noisy perceptions. We show that sensory information becomes intricately entangled with observer states, yielding a wide array of probabilistic classification results. This framework lays the groundwork for a quantum-probability-based understanding of the observer effect, encouraging further exploration of quantum correlations and properties in cognitive processes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforced entanglement in maximally mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is typically fragile to interactions with the environment. Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is `strongly symmetric', i.e. it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS), and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable, and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g. $SU(2)$), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically $\sim \log N$ with the number of qudits $N$.</description>

      <title>A practical framework for analyzing high-dimensional QKD setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional (HD) entanglement promises both enhanced key rates and overcoming obstacles faced by modern-day quantum communication. However, modern convex optimization-based security arguments are limited by computational constraints; thus, accessible dimensions are far exceeded by progress in HD photonics, bringing forth a need for efficient methods to compute key rates for large encoding dimensions. In response to this problem, we present a flexible analytic framework facilitated by the dual of a semi-definite program and diagonalizing operators inspired by entanglement-witness theory, enabling the efficient computation of key rates in high-dimensional systems. To facilitate the latter, we show how matrix completion techniques can be incorporated to effectively yield improved, computable bounds on the key rate in paradigmatic high-dimensional systems of time- or frequency-bin entangled photons and beyond.</description>

      <title>Realization of topological Thouless pumping in a synthetic Rydberg dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of synthetic dimensions by manipulating internal states of atoms and molecules has opened the door to investigate regimes outside those of more traditional quantum many-body platforms. Highly excited Rydberg states of atoms are a particularly promising platform to engineer Hamiltonians in such synthetic dimensions due to their large number of addressable states and the readily available technologies for manipulating their couplings and for detecting them. In this letter, we demonstrate the realization of topological quantum pumping in synthetic dimensions by engineering a one-dimensional Rice-Mele chain from the Rydberg states of cesium atoms, and manipulating their couplings in a time-dependent fashion through radio-frequency fields. We implement Thouless protocols for topological pumping and investigate the efficiency for pumping an effective quantum particle as a function of the period of pumping and other parameters while allowing for rates of change that are not necessarily adiabatic. We demonstrate that optimal pumping efficiencies of up to 90% can be achieved when the pump is operated in the topological Thouless regime, even when the pumping is accompanied by the wave-packet spread that arises from the energy dispersion of the particle along the synthetic dimension.</description>

      <title>Parallel trusted node approach for satellite quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) via satellite links is the only currently viable solution to create quantum-backed secure communication at a global scale. To achieve intercontinental coverage with available technology one must adopt a "flying trusted node" paradigm, in which users fully trust the satellite platform. Here, inspired by the concept of distributed secret sharing and the imminent projected launch of several QKD-equipped satellites, we propose a parallel trusted node approach, in which key distribution is mediated by several satellites in parallel. This has the effect of distributing the trust, removing single points of failure and reducing the necessary assumptions. In addition, we discuss the versatility that an optical ground station should provide to execute such a protocol and, in general, to be fully integrated into a multi-party global quantum network.</description>

      <title>Highly-entangled stationary states from strong symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, R\'enyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and R\'enyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while R\'enyi negativities with $n&gt;2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized R\'enyi negativities with $n&lt;2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space perform poorly for dynamics beyond unitary, as they are generally unattainable and fail to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we derive two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics that outperform previous bounds. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty of superoperators and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. They can be regarded as the generalization of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound, providing uncertainty relations between time, energy, and dissipation for open quantum dynamics. Additionally, our bounds are significantly simpler to estimate and experimentally more feasible as they require to compute or measure the overlap of density matrices and the variance of the Liouvillian. We have also obtained the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal (fastest) CPTP dynamics for given initial and final states. We give two important applications of our bounds. First, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. Second, using our bounds, we explain the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of cellular automata for the Hamiltonian of a free particle. It is based on a two-step unitary evolution operator in discrete time and space. Various experiments with one and two-dimensional cellular automata are used to analyze 1) phase velocities of plane waves, 2) dispersion and group velocities of wavepackets, 3) energy levels of infinite potential wells and harmonic oscillators, and 4) interference from double-slit diffraction. Some of the differences between their known (analytical) results and the cellular-automata approximations are intriguing.</description>

      <title>MEMO-QCD: Quantum Density Estimation through Memetic Optimisation for Quantum Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a strategy for efficient quantum circuit design for density estimation. The strategy is based on a quantum-inspired algorithm (DMKDE) for density estimation and a circuit optimisation routine based on memetic algorithms. The model maps a training dataset to a quantum state represented by a density matrix through a quantum feature map. This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state. We propose the application of a memetic algorithm to find the architecture and parameters of a variational quantum circuit that implements the quantum feature map, along with a variational learning strategy to prepare the training state. Demonstrations of the proposed strategy show an accurate approximation of the Gaussian kernel density estimation method through shallow quantum circuits illustrating the feasibility of the algorithm for near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Towards minimal self-testing of qubit states and measurements in prepare-and-measure scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing is a promising approach to certifying quantum states or measurements. Originally, it relied solely on the outcome statistics of the measurements involved in a device-independent (DI) setup. Extra physical assumptions about the system make the setup semi-DI. In the latter approach, we consider a prepare-and-measure scenario in which the dimension of the mediating particle is assumed to be two. In a setup involving four (three) preparations and three (two) projective measurements in addition to the target, we exemplify how to self-test any four- (three-) outcome extremal positive operator-valued measure using a linear witness. One of our constructions also achieves self-testing of any number of states with the help of as many projective measurements as the dimensionality of the space spanned by the corresponding Bloch vectors. These constructions are conjectured to be minimal in terms of the number of preparations and measurements required. In addition, we implement one of our prepare-and-measure constructions on IBM and IonQ quantum processors and certify the existence of a complex qubit Hilbert space based on the data obtained from these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum systems is one of the most promising tasks where quantum computing can potentially outperform classical computing. However, the robustness needed for reliable simulations of medium to large systems is beyond the reach of existing quantum devices. To address this, Quantum Krylov Subspace (QKS) methods have been developed, enhancing the ability to perform accelerated simulations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two QKS methods derived from the QDavidson algorithm, a novel approach for determining the ground and excited states of many-body systems. Unlike other QKS methods that pre-generate the Krylov subspace through real- or imaginary-time evolution, QDavidson iteratively adds basis vectors into the Krylov subspace. This iterative process enables faster convergence with fewer iterations and necessitates shallower circuit depths, marking a significant advancement in the field of quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Solving Fractional Differential Equations on a Quantum Computer: A Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for solving Caputo time-fractional partial differential equations. Our method employs an iterable cost function incorporating a linear combination of overlap history states. The proposed algorithm is not only efficient in time complexity, but has lower memory costs compared to classical methods. Our results indicate that solution fidelity is insensitive to the fractional index and that gradient evaluation cost scales economically with the number of time steps. As a proof of concept, we apply our algorithm to solve a range of fractional partial differential equations commonly encountered in engineering applications, such as the sub-diffusion equation, the non-linear Burgers' equation and a coupled diffusive epidemic model. We assess quantum hardware performance under realistic noise conditions, further validating the practical utility of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Direct generation of multi-photon hyperentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon hyperentangement is of fundamental importance in optical quantum information processing. Existing theory and experiment producing multi-photon hyperentangled states have until now relied on the outcome post-selection, a procedure where only the measurement results corresponding to the desired state are considered. Such approach severely limits the usefulness of the resulting hyperentangled states. We present the protocols of direct production of three- and four-photon hyperentanglement and extend the approach to an arbitrary number of photons through a straightforward cascade of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources. The generated multi-photon hyperentangled states are encoded in polarization-spatial modes and polarization-time bin degrees of freedom, respectively. Numerical calculation shows that if the average photon number $\mu$ is set to 1, the down conversion efficiency is $7.6*10^{-6}$ and the repetition frequency of the laser is $10^9$ Hz, the number of the generation of three-photon and four-photon hyperentanglement after cascading can reach about $5.78*10^{-2}$ and $4.44*10^{-7}$ pairs per second, respectively. By eliminating the constraints of outcome post-selection, our protocols may represent important progresses for multi-photon hyperentangement generation and providing a pivotal role in future multi-party and high-capacity communication networks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Birkhoff-Violation in Operational Theories: Thermodynamic Implications and Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accordance with the entropy principle of thermodynamics, under spontaneous evolutions, physical systems always evolve towards states with equal or greater randomness. But, where does this randomness originate? Renowned Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem, often referred to as Birkhoff theorem, identifies source of this randomness to be the stochastic application of reversible operations on the system under study, thereby ensuring its epistemic origin. Analogue of this theorem is known to fail in the quantum case. Here, we extend this investigation beyond quantum mechanics to a broader class of operational theories described within the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs). In this generalized framework, we establish Birkhoff-violation as the prevalent trait; in fact the asymptotic variant of the theorem gets violated. We then demonstrate that Birkhoff-violation in GPTs can lead to consequences that are atypical to quantum theory. For instance, we report manifestation of Birkhoff-violation in a communication task, which otherwise is not observed in quantum world. We also show that, unlike the quantum case, in other operational theories the state transformation criteria can be distinct under mixtures of reversible transformations and doubly stochastic evolutions, leading to different resource theories of purity. Despite these exotic implications, we analyze how to define a coherent notion of entropy in this generalized framework, while upholding alignment with von Neumann's thought experiment.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Quantum Communication with Surface and Hypergraph Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting multiple processors via quantum interconnect technologies could help to overcome issues of scalability in single-processor quantum computers. Transmission via these interconnects can be performed more efficiently using quantum multiplexing, where information is encoded in high-dimensional photonic degrees of freedom. We explore the effects of multiplexing on logical error rates in surface codes and hypergraph product codes. We show that, although multiplexing makes loss errors more damaging, assigning qubits to photons in an intelligent manner can minimize these effects, and the ability to encode higher-distance codes in a smaller number of photons can result in overall lower logical error rates. This multiplexing technique can also be adapted to quantum communication and multimode quantum memory with high-dimensional qudit systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction and entanglement engineering in driven giant atoms setup with coupled resonator waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coherent interactions mediated by the coupled resonator waveguide between two types of giant atoms. We find that the effective coupling and collective dissipation can be controlled on demand by adjusting the configuration of the giant atoms. As a result, the external driving gives birth to a substantial entanglement between two giant atoms, which exhibits a Rabi splitting character. {In the three giant atom setup, we find that the nonzero next neighbour atomic entanglement can surpass the neighbour ones, and is able to be adjust by tuning the driving phase, which serves as an artificial magnetic field. The enhancement of next neighbour atomic entanglement can not be realized in the small atom setup.} We hope these controllable interactions in giant atom array are of great applications in the quantum information process.</description>

      <title>Engineering bound state in continuum via giant atom in photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic system has been widely used in the field of lasing and sensing. We here find the controllable BIC in an artificial giant atom-dressed one-dimensional photonic waveguide. The giant atom couples to the waveguide via two distant sites. We find that the energy and the photonic distribution in the BIC can be controlled on demand by tuning the frequency and the size of the giant atom as well as its coupling phase with the waveguide. More interestingly, we predict the quantum beats in the atomic and photonic dynamical evolution, which is induced by the oscillation between the BIC and bound state outside the continuum (BOC). These findings provide an approach to manipulate the waveguide system via the bound states, and can be applied in the quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Cooperative decay of an ensemble of atoms in a one-dimensional chain with a single excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approximated expression of the cooperative decay rate of a one-dimensional chain of $N$ two-level atoms in the single-excitation configuration. From it, the interference nature of superradiance and subradiance arises naturally, without the need of solving the eigenvalue problem of the atom-atom interaction Green function. The cooperative decay rate can be interpreted as the imaginary part of the expectation value of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system, evaluated over a generalized Dicke state of N atoms in the single-excitation manifold. Whereas the subradiant decay rate is zero for an infinite chain, it decreases as 1/N for a finite chain. A simple approximated expression for the cooperative decay rate is obtained as a function of the lattice constant d and the atomic number N. The results are obtained first for the scalar model and then extended to the vectorial light model, assuming all the dipoles aligned.</description>

      <title>SA-DQAS: Self-attention Enhanced Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SA-DQAS in this paper, a novel framework that enhances the gradient-based Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) with a self-attention mechanism, aimed at optimizing circuit design for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) challenges. Analogous to a sequence of words in a sentence, a quantum circuit can be viewed as a sequence of placeholders containing quantum gates. Unlike DQAS, each placeholder is independent, while the self-attention mechanism in SA-DQAS helps to capture relation and dependency information among each operation candidate placed on placeholders in a circuit. To evaluate and verify, we conduct experiments on job-shop scheduling problems (JSSP), Max-cut problems, and quantum fidelity. Incorporating self-attention improves the stability and performance of the resulting quantum circuits and refines their structural design with higher noise resilience and fidelity. Our research demonstrates the first successful integration of self-attention with DQAS.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Reduction Methods and their Impact on QAOA Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstraction layers are of paramount importance in software architecture, as they shield the higher-level formulation of payload computations from lower-level details. Since quantum computing (QC) introduces many such details that are often unaccustomed to computer scientists, an obvious desideratum is to devise appropriate abstraction layers for QC. For discrete optimisation, one such abstraction is to cast problems in quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) form, which is amenable to a variety of quantum approaches. However, different mathematically equivalent forms can lead to different behaviour on quantum hardware, ranging from ease of mapping onto qubits to performance scalability. In this work, we show how using higher-order problem formulations (that provide better expressivity in modelling optimisation tasks than plain QUBO formulations) and their automatic transformation into QUBO form can be used to leverage such differences to prioritise between different desired non-functional properties for quantum optimisation. Our quantitative study shows that the approach allows us to satisfy different trade-offs, and suggests various possibilities for the future construction of general-purpose abstractions and automatic generation of useful quantum circuits from high-level problem descriptions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of General Noise Model Parameters from Surface Code's Syndrome Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active research on the surface code shows that its decoding performance can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the information of the noise model and optimizing the grid shape and decoding algorithm. Usually, the parameters in the noise model for the quantum error correction code must be prepared separately using some method, such as the quantum process tomography. There is a strong need to perform noise model estimation in parallel with the syndrome measurement during decoding to avoid the demanding prior tomography procedure. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-explored for Pauli noise, it remains under-studied for more complex noise models like amplitude damping. In this paper, we propose general noise model Bayesian inference methods that integrate the surface code's tensor network simulator, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, where the noise parameters are constant and do not change, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic situation, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present the numerical results of applying the proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and non-uniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum LSTM Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to the widespread adoption of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, known for their effectiveness in processing sequential data. However, LSTMs are constrained by inherent limitations such as the vanishing gradient problem and substantial computational demands. The advent of quantum computing presents a revolutionary approach to overcoming these obstacles. This paper introduces the Quantum LSTM (qLSTM) model, which integrates quantum computing principles with traditional LSTM networks to significantly enhance computational efficiency and model performance in sequence learning tasks. Quantum computing leverages qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition and entangle these states to represent complex correlations without direct physical interaction, offering a profound advancement over classical binary computing. Our qLSTM model aims to address the limitations of traditional LSTMs, providing a robust framework for more efficient and effective sequential data processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of a quantum system is represented in terms of operators corresponding to the kinetic and potential energies of the system. The expectation value of a Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian simulation are two of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computation. The overheads for realizing the two tasks are determined by the Pauli norm of Hamiltonian, which sums over all the absolute values of Pauli coefficients. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) called variational quantum Hamiltonian engineering (VQHE) to minimize the Pauli norm of Hamiltonian, such that the overhead for executing expectation value estimation and Hamiltonian simulation can be reduced. First, we develop a theory to encode the Pauli norm optimization problem into the vector L1-norm minimization problem. Then we devise an appropriate cost function and utilize the parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) to minimize the cost function. We also conduct numerical experiments to reduce the Pauli norm of the Ising Hamiltonian and molecules' Hamiltonian to show the efficiency of the proposed VQHE.</description>

      <title>Effect of measurements on quantum speed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the initial and final states of a quantum system, the speed of transportation of state vector in the projective Hilbert space governs the quantum speed limit. Here, we ask the question what happens to the quantum speed limit under continuous measurement process. We model the continuous measurement process by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which keeps the evolution of the system Schr{\"o}dinger-like even under the process of measurement. Using this specific measurement model, we prove that under continuous measurement, the speed of transportation of a quantum system tends to zero. Interestingly, we also find that for small time scale, there is an enhancement of quantum speed even if the measurement strength is finite. Our findings can have applications in quantum computing and quantum control where dynamics is governed by both unitary and measurement processes.</description>

      <title>Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindladian parity-time (PT) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations, including dissipative continuous time crystals, in one-collective spin models. By making an analogy to non-reciprocal phase transitions, we demonstrate that a transition point from the dynamical phase is associated with spontaneous PT symmetry breaking and typically corresponds to a \textit{critical exceptional point}. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial-state-dependent amplitude. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian PT symmetry at the microscopic level implies a non-linear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>On the Measurement of the Unruh Effect Through Extended Quantum Thermometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect, predicting a thermal reservoir for accelerating systems, calls for a more refined understanding of measurement processes involving quantum systems as thermometers. Conventional models fail to account for the inherent spatial extent of the thermometer, neglecting the complexities associated with accelerated extended quantum systems. Our work builds upon the seminal work of Bell, Hughes, and Leinaas. We propose a refined thermometer model incorporating a spin-1/2 particle where the spin acts as a temperature indicator. This refined model demonstrates the ability to effectively measure the temperature under specific, realistic conditions, providing a unique value that essentially averages the local Unruh temperatures throughout the extended quantum system acting as the thermometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technology can enable secure communication for cryptography purposes using quantum key distribution. Quantum key distribution protocols provide a secret key between two users with security guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. To define the proper implementation of a quantum key distribution system using a particular cryptography protocol, it is crucial to critically and meticulously assess the device's performance due to technological limitations in the components used. We perform simulations on the ANSYS Interconnect platform to characterise the practical implementation of these devices using distributed-phase-reference protocols differential-phase-shift and coherent-one-way quantum key distribution. Further, we briefly describe and simulate some possible eavesdropping attempts, backflash attack, trojan-horse attack and detector-blinding attack exploiting the device imperfections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir energy for $N$ $\delta$-function plates depends on multiple scattering parameter $\Delta$. This $N$ body interaction was distributed into two body interactions with nearest neighbour scattering and next-to-nearest neighbour scattering based on partitions of $N-1$ and its permutations. Implementing this methodology, we investigate Casimir energy for multiple plates with constant conductivity relatable to Graphene. We also study Casimir interaction between a perfect magnetic conductor and multiple constant conductivity $\delta$ plates, which results in Boyer repulsion. In the asymptotic limit for ideal boundary conditions, the results become simple where multiple scattering parameter $\Delta$ consists only of nearest neighbour scattering term.</description>

      <title>Emergence of superradiance in dissipative dipolar-coupled spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the superradiance phenomenon, a collection of non-interacting atoms exhibits collective dissipation due to interaction with a common radiation field, resulting in a non-monotonic decay profile. This work shows that dissipative dipolar-coupled systems exhibit an identical collective dissipation aided by the nonsecular part of the dipolar coupling. We consider a simplified dipolar network where the dipolar interaction between the spin-pairs is assumed to be identical. Hence the dynamics remain confined in the block diagonal Hilbert spaces. For a suitable choice of the initial condition, the resulting dynamics require dealing with a smaller subspace which helps extend the analysis to a larger spin network. To include the nonsecular dipolar relaxation, we use a fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation. We note that a successful observation of superradiance in this system requires a weak system-bath coupling. Moreover, we find that for an ensemble of N spins, the maximum intensity of the radiation exhibits a nearly quadratic scaling (N^2), and the dipolar relaxation time follows an inverse square proportionality (1/N^2); these two observations help characterize the emergence of superradiance. Our results agree well with the standard results of pure spin superradiance observed experimentally in various systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal demonstration of generalized quantum contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a set of empirical criteria fulfilled by any theory that satisfies the generalized notion of noncontextuality is a challenging task of both operational and foundational importance. The conventional approach of deriving facet inequalities from the relevant noncontextual polytope is computationally demanding. Specifically, the noncontextual polytope is a product of two polytopes, one for preparations and the other for measurements, and the dimension of the former typically increases polynomially with the number of measurements. This work presents an alternative methodology for constructing a polytope that encompasses the actual noncontextual polytope while ensuring that the dimension of the polytope associated with the preparations remains constant regardless of the number of measurements and their outcome size. In particular, the facet inequalities of this polytope serve as necessary conditions for noncontextuality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, we apply it to nine distinct contextuality scenarios involving four to nine preparations and two to three measurements to obtain the respective sets of facet inequalities. Additionally, we retrieve the maximum quantum violations of these inequalities. Our investigation uncovers many novel non-trivial noncontextuality inequalities and reveals intriguing aspects and applications of quantum contextual correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement and non-locality between specific spectral components of continuous variable two-mode squeezed mixed states, identifying their limits. These spectral components are selected from output modes using filters commonly employed in optomechanical systems. Both entanglement and non-locality reach their peak when the filters are identical. However, increasing the degree of input squeezing while applying non-identical filters disrupts both entanglement and non-locality, leading to a bell-shaped pattern. Additionally, we provide precise boundaries for entanglement and non-locality. Furthermore, we also evaluate the squeezing of two-mode hybrid quadrature as a measure of entanglement, thereby demonstrating how it remains analogous to logarithmic negativity. Combined with the filter, the population of two-mode squeezed thermal light influences the angle of a maximally squeezed hybrid quadrature.</description>

By recalling the quantity |U\r{ho}|({\Phi}) proposed by Zhang et al. (Quantum Inf. Process. 22 456, 2023), which involves terms of more quantum mechanical nature. We also establish the tighter uncertainty relations for quantum channels by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Detailed examples are provided to illustrate the tightness of our results.</description>

Abstract: Emerging technologies that employ quantum physics offer fundamental enhancements in information processing tasks, including sensing, communications, and computing. Here, we introduce the quantum phased array, which generalizes the operating principles of phased arrays and wavefront engineering to quantum fields, and report the first quantum phased array technology demonstration. An integrated photonic-electronic system is used to manipulate free-space quantum information to establish reconfigurable wireless quantum links in a standalone, compact form factor. Such a robust, scalable, and integrated quantum platform can enable broad deployment of quantum technologies with high connectivity, potentially expanding their use cases to real-world applications. We report the first, to our knowledge, free-space-to-chip interface for quantum links, enabled by 32 metamaterial antennas with more than 500,000 sub-wavelength engineered nanophotonic elements over a 550 x 550 $\mathrm{\mu m}^2$ physical aperture. We implement a 32-channel array of quantum coherent receivers with 30.3 dB shot noise clearance and 90.2 dB common-mode rejection ratio that downconverts the quantum optical information via homodyne detection and processes it coherently in the radio-frequency domain. With our platform, we demonstrate 32-pixel imaging of squeezed light for quantum sensing, reconfigurable free-space links for quantum communications, and proof-of-concept entanglement generation for measurement-based quantum computing. This approach offers targeted, real-time, dynamically-adjustable free-space capabilities to integrated quantum systems that can enable wireless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly held that quantum states with energy $E = 0$ would belong to the continuum. However, several situations have been reported when a zero-energy state becomes bound subject to certain restrictions on the coupling constants defining the potential. In the present work, we present another evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of QES potentials that correspond to rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland model. Our procedure is based upon the potential group approach with an underlying so$(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes the three cases guided by it on profitably carrying out a point canonical transformation. We deal with each case separately by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>An attractive way to correct for missing singles excitations in unitary coupled cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cluster methods based exclusively on double excitations are comparatively "cheap" and interesting model chemistries, as they are typically able to capture the bulk of the dynamical electron correlation effects. The trade-off in such approximations is that the effect of neglected excitations, particularly single excitations, can be considerable. Using standard and electron pair-restricted $T_2$ operators to define two flavors of unitary coupled cluster doubles (UCCD) methods, we investigate the extent in which missing single excitations can be recovered from low-order corrections in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) within the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) formalism. Our analysis includes the derivations of finite-order, UCC energy functionals which are used as a basis to define perturbative estimates of missed single excitations. This leads to the novel UCCD[4S] and UCCD[6S] methods, which consider energy corrections for missing singles excitations through fourth- and sixth-order in MBPT, respectively. We also apply the same methodology to the electron pair-restricted ansatz, but the improvements are only marginal. Our findings show that augmenting UCCD with these post hoc perturbative corrections can lead to UCCSD-quality results.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Signaling in the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton model is a semi-classical theory in which, in addition to mutual attraction, massive quantum particles interact with their own gravitational fields. While there are many studies on the phenomenology of single particles, correlation dynamics in multipartite systems is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the Schr\"odinger-Newton interactions preserve the product form of initial states, yet on average it agrees with classical mechanics of continuous mass distributions. This leads to a simple test of the model, based on verifying bipartite gravitational evolution towards non-product states. We show using standard quantum mechanics that, with currently accessible single-particle parameters, two masses released from harmonic traps get correlated well before any observable entanglement is accumulated. Therefore, the Schr\"odinger-Newton model can be tested with setups aimed at observation of gravitational entanglement with significantly relaxed requirements on coherence time. We also present a mixed-state extension of the model that avoids superluminal signaling.</description>

      <title>Wigner non-negative states that verify the Wigner entropy conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present further progress, in the form of analytical results, on the Wigner entropy conjecture set forth in https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.042211 and https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/aa852f/meta. Said conjecture asserts that the differential entropy defined for non-negative, yet physical, Wigner functions is minimized by pure Gaussian states while the minimum entropy is equal to $1+\ln\pi$. We prove this conjecture for the qubits formed by Fock states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ that correspond to non-negative Wigner functions. In particular, we derive an explicit form of the Wigner entropy for those states lying on the boundary of the set of Wigner non-negative qubits. We then consider general mixed states and derive a sufficient condition for Wigner non-negativity. For states satisfying our condition we verify that the conjecture is true. Lastly, we elaborate on the states of the set which is in accordance with our condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing and receiving information plays a pivotal role in science and technology. Quantum communication relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to transmit information in a nonclassical manner. Existing quantum communication protocols are commonly based on shared entangled states between sender and receiver, while the transmitting medium is classical. We here demonstrate that information transfer may be enhanced in a quantum correlated medium without entanglement distribution. We concretely show that nonclassical correlations, with nonzero discord, between the first two spins of a spin chain that acts as a quantum wire can increase the information flow and reduce the propagation time. We relate this effect to the breaking of the spatial symmetry of the out-of-time-order correlator that characterizes the spread of information through the medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are limited in scalability or the types of error they can quantify, necessitating new techniques for quantifying their performance. Here, we introduce a theory for learning Pauli noise in MCMs and use it to create MCM cycle benchmarking, a scalable method for benchmarking MCMs. MCM cycle benchmarking extracts detailed information about the rates of errors in randomly compiled layers of MCMs and Clifford gates, and we demonstrate how its results can be used to quantify correlated errors during MCMs on current quantum hardware. Our method can be integrated into existing Pauli noise learning techniques to scalably characterize and benchmark wide classes of circuits containing MCMs.</description>

      <title>Prospects for NMR Spectral Prediction on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a prominent analytical tool, with applications throughout chemistry, medicine and solid-state physics. While conventional NMR spectrometers require large magnetic fields to interrogate a sample, recent advances in atomic magnetometry have enabled this spectroscopy far below geomagnetic field strengths. This zero-to-ultralow (ZULF) field regime can be advantageous since it mitigates relaxation and reveals spin couplings that are otherwise obscured, all while using compact and lower-overhead instrumentation. The resulting spectra are nonetheless difficult to interpret without computation, which can be taxing due to the presence of vector couplings and long-range spin networks. Following recent proposals, we demonstrate how fault-tolerant quantum computation could be used to simulate these spectra. Our analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits based on qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how NMR spectral prediction might be an early application for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Investigate the Performance of Distribution Loading with Conditional Quantum Generative Adversarial Network Algorithm on Quantum Hardware with Error Suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines the efficacy of the Fire Opal error suppression and AI circuit optimization system integrated with IBM's quantum computing platform for a multi-modal distribution loading algorithm. Using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a quantitative error analysis, the results indicate that Fire Opal can improve on the time-dependent distributions generated by our Conditional Quantum Generative Adversarial algorithm by 30-40\% in comparison with the results on the simulator. In addition, Fire Opal's performance remains consistent for complex circuits despite the needs to run more trials. The research concludes that Fire Opal's error suppression and circuit optimization significantly enhanced quantum computing processes, highlighting its potential for practical applications. In addition, the study also reviews leading error mitigation strategies, including zero noise extrapolation (ZNE), probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), Pauli twirling, measurement error mitigation, and machine learning methods, assessing their advantages and disadvantages in terms of technical implementation, quantum resources, and scalability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any given experimental scenario, the rules of quantum theory provide statistical distributions that the observed outcomes are expected to follow. The set formed by all these distributions contains the imprint of quantum theory, capturing some of its core properties. So far, only partial descriptions have been known for this set, even in the simplest scenarios. Here, we obtain the analytical description of a complete set of quantum statistics in terms of extremal points. This is made possible by finding all bipartite quantum states and pairs of binary measurements which can be self-tested, i.e. identified from statistics only. Our description provides a direct insight into the properties and limitations of quantum theory. These are not expressed in terms of Hilbert spaces, but rather directly in terms of measurement observation statistics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universal Quench Dynamics in Randomly Interacting Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality often emerges in low-energy equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, despite their microscopic complexity and variety. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Such dynamics usually involves highly excited states beyond the traditional low-energy theory description. Whether universal behaviors can also emerge in such non-equilibrium dynamics is a central issue at the frontier of quantum dynamics. Here we report the experimental observation of universal dynamics by monitoring the spin depolarization process in a solid-state NMR system described by an ensemble of randomly interacting spins. The spin depolarization can be related to temporal spin-spin correlation functions at high temperatures. We discover a remarkable phenomenon that these correlation functions obey a universal functional form. This experimental fact helps us identify the dominant interacting processes in the spin depolarization dynamics that lead to this universality. Our observation demonstrates the existence of universality even in non-equilibrium dynamics at high temperatures, thereby complementing the well-established universality in low-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: For spinful systems with spin 1/2, it is generally believed that P and T invariant strong and second-order topologies exist in four band and eight band system, respectively. Here, by using periodic driving, we find it is possible to have strong topological insulator, second-order topological insulator and hybrid-order topological insulator in a single four band system. Furthermore, we established a direct connection between topology and dynamics. More convenient experimental detection for these topological phases has also been proposed. This study provides the theoretical basis for novel topological insulator that possess hybrid-order boundary states beyond the conventional regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using potential energies calculated on quantum computers would allow virtually exact dynamics for chemical and biochemical systems, with substantial impacts on the fields of catalysis and biophysics. However, noisy hardware, the costs of computing gradients, and the number of qubits required to simulate large systems present major challenges to realizing the potential of dynamical simulations using quantum hardware. Here, we demonstrate that some of these issues can be mitigated by recent advances in machine learning. By combining transfer learning with techniques for building machine-learned potential energy surfaces, we propose a new path forward for molecular dynamics simulations on quantum hardware. We use transfer learning to reduce the number of energy evaluations that use quantum hardware by first training models on larger, less accurate classical datasets and then refining them on smaller, more accurate quantum datasets. We demonstrate this approach by training machine learning models to predict a molecule's potential energy using Behler-Parrinello neural networks. When successfully trained, the model enables energy gradient predictions necessary for dynamics simulations that cannot be readily obtained directly from quantum hardware. To reduce the quantum resources needed, the model is initially trained with data derived from low-cost techniques, such as Density Functional Theory, and subsequently refined with a smaller dataset obtained from the optimization of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz. We show that this approach significantly reduces the size of the quantum training dataset while capturing the high accuracies needed for quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Russian Doll Model (RDM) of superconductivity for finite energy levels. Previously, cyclic renormalization group (RG) and Efimov scaling were found in RDM for part of the equidistant spectrum and we generalize this observation in a few directions. We find that when the whole spectrum is considered, equidistancy condition is removed or diagonal disorder is added, the cyclicity of RG survives but the period of RG becomes energy dependent. The analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Mental intervention in quantum scattering of ions without violating conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several proposals in the past that mind might influence matter by exploiting the randomness of quantum events. Here, calculations are presented how mental selection of quantum mechanical scattering directions of ions in the axon hillock of neuronal cells could influence diffusion and initiate an action potential. Only a few thousand ions would need to be affected. No conservation laws are violated, but a momentary and very small local decrease of temperature should occur, consistent with a quantum mechanically possible but extremely improbable evolution. An estimate of the concurrent violation of the second law of thermodynamics is presented. Some thoughts are given to how this hypothesized mental intervention could be tested.</description>

      <title>Large-scale spin-orbit photonic circuits in two dimensions</title>

Abstract: Photonic circuits, optical platforms that connect input and output modes according to a specific map, serve as effective optical processors for both classical and quantum states of light. The number of optical elements typically scales with that of processed modes, leading to a direct correlation between system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. Here we present a photonic circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps, linking a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to the outcome of a quantum walk of structured photons, realized experimentally through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having the local orientation of optic axes artificially engineered in a complex pattern. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, keeping optical losses constant. The patterns can be designed to accurately replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the three optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss photonic circuits that target a broader range of unitary maps, primarily for manipulating multi-photon states in genuinely quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Laser-target symmetry-breaking in high harmonic generation: from frequency shift to odd-even intensity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the frequency shift and odd-even intensity modulation in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) have both been observed for asymmetric laser-target systems, they are typically studied as two separate phenomena. In this Letter, we provide a comprehensive picture of these two nonlinear optical phenomena, unifying them through a common origin - asymmetry of the laser-target system. By tuning asymmetric laser-target systems, we discover a transition from the harmonic frequency shift to the odd-even intensity modulation upon increasing the duration of the driving laser pulse. Specifically, these phenomena are observed simultaneously for laser pulses with intermediate pulse duration. For numerical evidence, we solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, while insight into the underlying physics is obtained from a simplified analytically tractable model. Understanding the asymmetric characteristics reflected in the HHG as provided is crucial for retrieving laser-target information, sampling external fields, and probing molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication represents a revolutionary advancement over classical information theory, which leverages unique quantum mechanics properties like entanglement to achieve unprecedented capabilities in secure and efficient information transmission. Unlike bits in classical communication, quantum communication utilizes qubits in superposition states, allowing for novel information storage and processing. Entanglement, a key quantum phenomenon, enables advanced protocols with enhanced security and processing power. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of quantum communication, emphasizing the role of entanglement in theoretical foundations, practical protocols, experimental progress, and security implications. It contrasts quantum communications potential applications with classical networks, identifying areas where entanglement offers significant advantages. The paper explores the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in communication, the physical realization of quantum information, and the formation of secure quantum networks through entanglement-based strategies like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and teleportation. It addresses the challenges of long-distance quantum communication, the role of quantum repeaters in scaling networks, and the conceptualization of interconnected quantum networks. Additionally, it discusses strides towards the Quantum Internet, Quantum Error-Correcting codes, and quantum cryptographys role in ensuring secure communication. By highlighting the role of entanglement, this paper aims to inspire further research and innovation in secure and efficient information exchange within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent ground state of quantum many-body systems, including for fermionic systems. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in Neural Slater-Backflow-Jastrow wavefunction ansatzes, and demonstrate how our model allows us to target the ground state and low-lying excited states. To capture the Hamiltonian symmetries, we introduce group-equivariant backflow transformations. We study the low-energy excitation spectrum of the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling, and find that our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves the ground-state energies, and yields accurate low-lying excited states for up to 10x10 lattices. We additionally compute the two-point density-correlation function and the structure factor to detect the phase transition and determine the critical point. Finally, we quantify the variational accuracy of our model using the V-score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering probes the internal structure of quantum systems. We calculate the two-particle elastic scattering phase shift for a short-ranged interaction on a quantum computer. Short-ranged interactions with a large scattering length or shallow bound state describe a universality class that is of interest in atomic, condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. The phase shift is calculated by relating the ground state energy of the interacting particles in a harmonic trap. The relaxation method is used as the variational quantum eigensolver for the ground state calculation. Schmidt decomposition is used to reduce quantum circuits nominally requiring tens of qubits to 2-qubit circuits, thus reducing the noise in quantum measurements. Calculations in multi-particle systems with many-body interactions would benefit from this reduction of qubits in noisy quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: We use Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) to compare the doping dependence of magnetic excitations of an Infinite-Layer nickelate to those of a prototypical superconducting cuprate. The polarization analysis of RIXS spectra establishes the dominant spin-flip nature of the mid-infrared peak in both cases. Hole doping leads to opposite behavior of the magnetic energy in the two materials. By fitting the data with an original Hubbard-based model for dynamic susceptibility, we find that t is comparable in the two materials while U is about twice larger in the nickelate. This finding accounts for the smaller magnetic bandwidth of nickelates and for its decrease upon doping.</description>

Abstract: An observer at rest with the expanding universe experiences some extra noise in the quantum vacuum, and so does an accelerated observer in a vacuum at rest (in Minkowski space). The literature mainly focuses on the ideal cases of exponential expansion (de-Sitter space) or uniform acceleration (Rindler trajectories) or both, but the real cosmic expansion is non-exponential and real accelerations are non-uniform. Here we use the frequency-time Wigner function of vacuum correlations to define time-dependent spectra. We found excellent Planck spectra for a class of realistic cosmological models, but also strongly non-Planckian, negative Wigner functions for a standard scenario testable with laboratory analogues.</description>

      <title>An optical atomic clock using $4D_J$ states of rubidium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze an optical atomic clock using two-photon $5S_{1/2} \rightarrow 4D_J$ transitions in rubidium. Four one- and two-color excitation schemes to probe the fine-structure states $4D_{3/2}$ and $4D_{5/2}$ are considered in detail. We compare key characteristics of Rb $4D_J$ and $5D_{5/2}$ two-photon clocks. The $4D_J$ clock features a high signal-to-noise ratio due to two-photon decay at favorable wavelengths, low dc electric and magnetic susceptibilities, and minimal black-body shifts. Ac Stark shifts from the clock interrogation lasers are compensated by two-color Rabi-frequency matching. We identify a "magic" wavelength near 1060~nm, which allows for in-trap, Doppler-free clock-transition interrogation with lattice-trapped cold atoms. From our analysis of clock statistics and systematics, we project a quantum-noise-limited relative clock stability at the $10^{-13}/\sqrt{\tau(s)}$-level, with integration time $\tau$ in seconds, and a relative accuracy of $\sim 10^{-13}$. We describe a potential architecture for implementing the proposed clock using a single telecom clock laser at 1550~nm, which is conducive to optical communication and long-distance clock comparisons. Our work could be of interest in efforts to realize small and portable Rb clocks and in high-precision measurements of atomic properties of Rb $4D_J$-states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

Abstract: We propose an efficient, scalable, and deterministic scheme to generate multiple indistinguishable photons over independent channels, on demand. Our design relies on multiple single-photon sources, each coupled to a waveguide, and all of them interact with a common cavity mode. The cavity synchronizes and triggers the simultaneous emission of one photon by each source, which are collected by the waveguides. For a state-of-the-art circuit QED implementation, this scheme supports the creation of single photons with purity, indistinguishability, and efficiency of $99\%$ at rates of $\sim $MHz. We also discuss conditions to produce up to 100 photons simultaneously with generation rates of hundreds of kHz. This is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous demultiplexed sources for boson sampling and enables the realization of deterministic multi-photon sources and scalable quantum information processing with photons.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Exploration in Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Logarithmic Worst-Case Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted a surge of attention recently, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, it remains elusive how to design provably efficient quantum RL algorithms that can address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. To this end, we propose a novel UCRL-style algorithm that takes advantage of quantum computing for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and horizon $H$, and establish an $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(S, A, H, \log T))$ worst-case regret for it, where $T$ is the number of episodes. Furthermore, we extend our results to quantum RL with linear function approximation, which is capable of handling problems with large state spaces. Specifically, we develop a quantum algorithm based on value target regression (VTR) for linear mixture MDPs with $d$-dimensional linear representation and prove that it enjoys $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d, H, \log T))$ regret. Our algorithms are variants of UCRL/UCRL-VTR algorithms in classical RL, which also leverage a novel combination of lazy updating mechanisms and quantum estimation subroutines. This is the key to breaking the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$-regret barrier in classical RL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the online exploration in quantum RL with provable logarithmic worst-case regret.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent development of quantum information theory, some attempts exist to construct information theory beyond quantum theory. Here we consider hypothesis testing relative entropy and one-shot classical capacity, that is, the optimal rate of classical information transmitted by using a single channel under a constraint of a certain error probability, in general physical theories where states and measurements are operationally defined. Then we obtain the upper bound of one-shot classical capacity by generalizing the method given by Wang and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 200501 (2012)]. Also, we derive the lower bound of the capacity by showing the existence of a good code that can transmit classical information with a certain error probability. Applying the above two bounds, we prove the asymptotic equivalence between classical capacity and hypothesis testing relative entropy even in any general physical theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a tensor network (TN) scheme into the entanglement augmentation process of the synergistic optimization framework by Rudolph et al. [arXiv:2208.13673] to build its process systematically for inhomogeneous systems. Our synergistic approach first embeds the variational optimal solution of the TN state with the entropic area law, which can be perfectly optimized in conventional (classical) computers, in a quantum variational circuit ansatz inspired by the TN state with the entropic volume law. Next, the framework performs a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) process with embedded states as the initial state. We applied the synergistic to the ground-state analysis of the all-to-all coupled random transverse-field Ising, XYZ, Heisenberg model, employing the binary multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) state and branching MERA states as TN states with entropic area law and volume law, respectively. We then show that the synergistic accelerates VQE calculations in the three models without an initial parameter guess of the branching-MERA-inspired ansatz and can avoid a local solution trapped by a standard VQE with the ansatz in the Ising model. The improvement of optimizers for MERA in all-to-all coupled inhomogeneous systems, enhancement, and potential synergistic applications are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: For quantum state tomography on rank-$r$ dimension-$d$ states, we show that $\widetilde{O}(r^{.5}d^{1.5}/\epsilon) \leq \widetilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon)$ copies suffice for accuracy~$\epsilon$ with respect to (Bures) $\chi^2$-divergence, and $\widetilde{O}(rd/\epsilon)$ copies suffice for accuracy~$\epsilon$ with respect to quantum relative entropy. The best previous bound was $\widetilde{O}(rd/\epsilon) \leq \widetilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon)$ with respect to infidelity; our results are an improvement since infidelity is bounded above by both the relative entropy and the $\chi^2$-divergence. For algorithms that are required to use single-copy measurements, we show that $\widetilde{O}(r^{1.5} d^{1.5}/\epsilon) \leq \widetilde{O}(d^3/\epsilon)$ copies suffice for $\chi^2$-divergence, and $\widetilde{O}(r^{2} d/\epsilon)$ suffice for relative entropy.
  Using this tomography algorithm, we show that $\widetilde{O}(d^{2.5}/\epsilon)$ copies of a $d\times d$-dimensional bipartite state suffice to test if it has quantum mutual information~$0$ or at least~$\epsilon$. As a corollary, we also improve the best known sample complexity for the \emph{classical} version of mutual information testing to $\widetilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $s, t$ in an unweighted undirected graph $G$, the goal of the pathfinding problem is to find an $s$-$t$ path. In this work, we first construct a graph $G$ based on welded trees and define a pathfinding problem in the adjacency list oracle $O$. Then we provide an efficient quantum algorithm to find an $s$-$t$ path in the graph $G$. Finally, we prove that no classical algorithm can find an $s$-$t$ path in subexponential time with high probability. The pathfinding problem is one of the fundamental graph-related problems. Our findings suggest that quantum algorithms may potentially offer advantages in more types of graphs to solve the pathfinding problem and open up new possibilities for practical applications of quantum computations in various fields.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy for Physics Beyond Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose terminology to classify interpretations of quantum mechanics and models that modify or complete quantum mechanics. Our focus is on models which have previously been referred to as superdeterministic (strong or weak), retrocausal (with or without signalling, dynamical or non-dynamical), future-input-dependent, atemporal and all-at-once, not always with the same meaning or context. Sometimes these models are assumed to be deterministic, sometimes not, the word deterministic has been given different meanings, and different notions of causality have been used when classifying them. This has created much confusion in the literature, and we hope that the terms proposed here will help to clarify the nomenclature. The general model framework that we will propose may also be useful to classify other interpretations and modifications of quantum mechanics. This document grew out of the discussions at the 2022 Bonn Workshop on Superdeterminism and Retrocausality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double state (TFD) as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the entanglement forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal properties of the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with chemical potential using variational quantum algorithms, crucial in comprehending particle behaviour within lattices at high temperatures in condensed matter systems. Conventional computational methods encounter challenges, especially in managing chemical potential, prompting exploration into Hamiltonian approaches. Despite the promise of quantum algorithms, their efficacy is hampered by coherence limitations when simulating extended imaginary time evolution sequences. To overcome such constraints, this research focuses on optimising variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of materials at elevated temperatures. Our study demonstrates the potential of variational algorithms in simulating the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model while acknowledging limitations stemming from error sources in quantum devices and encountering barren plateaus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the single photon scattering and bound states in a coupled resonator waveguide (CRW) which couples to a topological giant atom (TGA) via two distant sites. Here, the TGA is constructed by a one dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with finite length. By modulating the topological phase of the TGA, the incident photon in the CRW can be completely reflected or transmitted, and is therefore beneficial to design the coherent photonic device. Meanwhile, we also achieve two pairs of bound states locating respectively above and blow the continuum. Whether the gap is open or closed depends on the boundary condition of the TGA. Therefore, the combination of the topology and the interference provides us an exciting opportunity to manipulate the photonic state in the context of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Unitary Property Testing with Proofs and Advice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unitary property testing a quantum algorithm, also known as a tester, is given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it satisfies some property. We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of unitary property testing and related problems, which utilises its connection to unitary channel discrimination. The main advantage of this technique is that all obtained lower bounds hold for any $\mathsf{C}$-tester with $\mathsf{C} \subseteq \mathsf{QMA}(2)/\mathsf{qpoly}$, showing that even having access to both (unentangled) quantum proofs and advice does not help for many unitary problems. We apply our technique to prove lower bounds for problems like quantum phase estimation, the entanglement entropy problem, quantum Gibbs sampling and more, removing all logarithmic factors in the lower bounds obtained by the sample-to-query lifting theorem of Wang and Zhang (2023). As a direct corollary, we show that there exist quantum oracles relative to which $\mathsf{QMA}(2) \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$ and $\mathsf{QMA}/\mathsf{qpoly} \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$. The former shows that, at least in a black-box way, having unentangled quantum proofs does not help in solving problems that require high precision.</description>

      <title>Logical Noise Bias in Magic State Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant architectures aim to reduce the noise of a quantum computation. Despite such architectures being well studied a detailed understanding of how noise is transformed in a fault-tolerant primitive such as magic state injection is currently lacking. We use numerical simulations of logical process tomography on a fault-tolerant gadget that implements a logical T = $Z({\pi}/8)$ gate using magic state injection, to understand how noise characteristics at the physical level are transformed into noise characteristics at the logical level. We show how, in this gadget, a significant phase ($Z$) bias can arise in the logical noise, even with unbiased noise at the physical level. While the magic state injection gadget intrinsically induces biased noise, with extant phase bias being further amplified at the logical level, we identify noisy error correction circuits as a key limiting factor on the magnitude of this logical noise bias. Our approach provides a framework for assessing the detailed noise characteristics, as well as the overall performance, of fault-tolerant logical primitives.</description>

Abstract: As an essential component of state-of-the-art quantum technologies, fast and efficient quantum measurements are in persistent demand over time. We present a proof-of-principle experiment on a new dimensionless pseudo-spin pointer based on weak measurement. In the context of optical parameter estimation, we demonstrate that the parametric distribution's moment is obtained experimentally by employing the dimensionless pointer without measuring the distribution literally. In addition to the sheer liberation of experimental expense, the photon-countering-based pointer is well-calibrated for the detection of weak signals. We show that for signals $3$-$4$ orders of weaker in strength than the area-array camera method, an order of improvement in precision is achieved experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the propagation of information through quantum many-body systems, developed to study quantum chaos, have found many application from black holes to disordered spin systems. Among other quantitative tools, Krylov complexity has been explored as a diagnostic tool for information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a universal limit to the growth of the Krylov complexity in dissipative open quantum systems by utilizing the uncertainty relation for non-hermitian operators. We also present the analytical results of Krylov complexity for characteristic behavior of Lanczos coefficients in dissipative systems. The validity of these results are demonstrated by explicit study of transverse-field Ising model under dissipative effects.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework that enables a direct calculation of their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed. Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial steady states and long-time dynamics for open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. Notably, we identify a novel $(1+1)$-D mixed-state quantum phase that has no counterpart in closed systems, where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We further establish the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

Abstract: Generating indistinguishable photons from independent nodes is an important challenge for the development of quantum networks. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of highly indistinguishable single photons from two dissimilar atomic quantum nodes. One node is based on a fully blockaded cold Rydberg ensemble and generates on-demand single photons. The other node is a quantum repeater node based on a DLCZ quantum memory and emits heralded single photons after a controllable memory time that is used to synchronize the two sources. We demonstrate an indistinguishability of ${94.6 \pm 5.2 \%}$ for a temporal window including ${90\%}$ of the photons. This advancement opens new possibilities for interconnecting quantum repeater and processing nodes with high fidelity Bell-state measurement without sacrificing its efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state purification is the functionality that, given multiple copies of an unknown state, outputs a state with increased purity. This will be an essential building block for near- and middle-term quantum ecosystems before the availability of full fault tolerance, where one may want to suppress errors not only in expectation values but also in quantum states. We propose an effective state purification gadget with a moderate quantum overhead by projecting $M$ noisy quantum inputs to their symmetric subspace defined by a set of projectors forming a symmetric subgroup with order $M$. Our method, applied in every short evolution over $M$ redundant copies of noisy states, can suppress both coherent and stochastic errors by a factor of $1/M$, respectively. This reduces the circuit implementation cost $M$ times smaller than the state projection to the full symmetric subspace proposed by Barenco et al. more than two decades ago. We also show that our gadget purifies the depolarised inputs with probability $p$ to asymptotically $O\left(p^{2}\right)$ with an optimal choice of $M$ when $p$ is small. The sampling cost scales $O\left(p^{-1}\right)$ for small $p$, which is also shown to be asymptotically optimal. Our method provides flexible choices of state purification depending on the hardware restrictions before fully fault-tolerant computation is available.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices offer a novel approach to realize quantum computations, where the quantum two-level system (qubit) is replaced with the quantum (an)harmonic oscillator (qumode) as the fundamental building block of the quantum simulator. The simulation of chemical structure and dynamics can then be achieved by representing or mapping the system Hamiltonians in terms of bosonic operators. In this perspective, we review recent progress and future potential of using bosonic quantum devices for addressing a wide range of challenging chemical problems, including the calculation of molecular vibronic spectra, the simulation of gas-phase and solution-phase adiabatic and nonadiabatic chemical dynamics, the efficient solution of molecular graph theory problems, and the calculations of electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fighting against noise is crucial for NISQ devices to demonstrate practical quantum applications. In this work, we give a new paradigm of quantum error mitigation based on the vectorization of density matrices. Different from the ideas of existing quantum error mitigation methods that try to distill noiseless information from noisy quantum states, our proposal directly changes the way of encoding information and maps the density matrices of noisy quantum states to noiseless pure states, which is realized by a novel and NISQ-friendly measurement protocol and a classical post-processing procedure. Our protocol requires no knowledge of the noise model, no ability to tune the noise strength, and no ancilla qubits for complicated controlled unitaries. Under our encoding, NISQ devices are always preparing pure quantum states which are highly desired resources for variational quantum algorithms to have good performance in many tasks. We show how this protocol can be well-fitted into variational quantum algorithms. We give several concrete ansatz constructions that are suitable for our proposal and do theoretical analysis on the sampling complexity, the expressibility, and the trainability. We also give a discussion on how this protocol is influenced by large noise and how it can be well combined with other quantum error mitigation protocols. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>

      <title>Consistency and Causality of Interconnected Nonsignaling Resources</title>

Abstract: This paper examines networks of $n$ measuring parties sharing $m$ independent nonsignaling resources that can be locally wired together: that is, each party follows a scheme to measure the resources in a cascaded fashion with inputs to later resources possibly depending on outputs of earlier-measured ones. A specific framework is provided for studying probability distributions arising in such networks, and this framework is used to directly prove some accepted, but often only implicitly invoked, facts: there is a uniquely determined and well-defined joint probability distribution for the outputs of all resources shared by the parties, and this joint distribution is nonsignaling. It is furthermore shown that is often sufficient to restrict consideration to only extremal nonsignaling resources when considering features and properties of such networks. Finally, the framework illustrates how the physical theory of nonsignaling boxes and local wirings is causal, supporting the applicability of the inflation technique to constrain such models.
  For an application, we probe the example of (3,2,2) inequalities that witness genuine three-party nonlocality according to the local-operations-shared-randomness definition, and show how all other examples can be derived from that of Mao et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:150401 (2022)]</description>

      <title>Novel oracle constructions for quantum random access memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new designs for quantum random access memory. More precisely, for each function, $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^d$, we construct oracles, $\mathcal{O}_f$, with the property \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{O}_f \left| x \right\rangle_n \left| 0 \right\rangle_d = \left| x \right\rangle_n \left| f(x) \right\rangle_d. \end{equation} Our methods are based on the Walsh-Hadamard Transform of $f$, viewed as an integer valued function. In general, the complexity of our method scales with the sparsity of the Walsh-Hadamard Transform and not the sparsity of $f$, yielding more favorable constructions in cases such as binary optimization problems and function with low-degree Walsh-Hadamard Transforms. Furthermore, our design comes with a tuneable amount of ancillas that can trade depth for size. In the ancilla-free design, these oracles can be $\epsilon$-approximated so that the Clifford + $T$ depth is $O \left( \left( n + \log_2 \left( \tfrac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \right) \mathcal{W}_f \right)$, where $\mathcal{W}_f$ is the number of nonzero components in the Walsh-Hadamard Transform. The depth of the shallowest version is $O \left( n + \log_2 \left( \tfrac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \right)$, using $n + d \mathcal{W}_f$ qubit. The connectivity of these circuits is also only logarithmic in $\mathcal{W}_f$. As an application, we show that for boolean functions with low approximate degrees (as in the case of read-once formulas) the complexities of the corresponding QRAM oracles scale only as $2^{\widetilde{O} \left( \sqrt{n} \log_2 \left( n \right) \right)}$.</description>

      <title>Analytically exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for neutral helium in the ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents the analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation and its corresponding wave function for the neutral helium or helium-like atoms in the ground state. The state functions of the two electrons for s=0 and l=0 as well as their boundary conditions are examined in detail. Furthermore, a method for describing a generic electron potential consisting of Coulomb and exchange interactions is derived, and the resulting potential function is integrated into the Schrodinger equation as a potential term. In addition, the altered electromagnetic coupling of the electrons due to vacuum polarization effects is investigated and finally the Schrodinger equation for the neutral 1S0 Helium, historically known as Para-Helium, is solved using Laplace transformations. The energy in the ground state is then determined, and it can be shown that this agrees with the literature values given the fact that the electron can be assumed to be a point-like particle. In the context of these investigations, an upper limit estimation for the spatial dimension of the electron can also be given as well is the existence of a minimal distance of a stable bonding state between two electrons, which can be interpreted as an entangled state; in addition, the chemical inertness of helium with regard to chemical reactions - i.e. the principle of the "closed" electron shell - can be made plausible by the quantum mechanical electron configuration and its consequences with regard to binding energy. The wave function found for the helium atom is compared with the known solutions for the hydrogen atom, and essential differences between the two are worked out.</description>

      <title>Controlling Unknown Quantum States via Data-Driven State Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate control of quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and other quantum technologies. In the basic scenario, the task is to steer a quantum system towards a target state through a sequence of control operations. Determining the appropriate operations, however, generally requires information about the initial state of the system. When the initial state is not {\em a priori} known, gathering this information is generally challenging for quantum systems of increasing size. To address this problem, we develop a machine-learning algorithm that uses a small amount of measurement data to construct a representation of the system's state. The algorithm compares this data-driven representation with the representation of the target state, and uses reinforcement learning to output the appropriate control operations.We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm showing that it achieves accurate control of unknown many-body quantum states and non-Gaussian continuous-variable states using data from a limited set of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fault tolerant simulation of strongly correlated systems using the Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of strongly correlated materials is one of the grand challenge problems for physics today. A large class of scientifically interesting materials, from high-$T_c$ superconductors to spin liquids, involve medium to strong correlations, and building a holistic understanding of these materials is critical. Doing so is hindered by the competition between the kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion, which renders both analytic and numerical methods unsatisfactory for describing interacting materials. Fault-tolerant quantum computers have been proposed as a path forward to overcome these difficulties, but this potential capability has not yet been fully assessed. Here, using the multi-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model as a representative model and a source of scalable problem specifications, we estimate the resource costs needed to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for obtaining experimentally relevant quantities such as correlation function estimation. We find that advances in quantum algorithms and hardware will be needed in order to reduce quantum resources and feasibly address utility-scale problem instances.</description>

      <title>Exact Correlation Functions for Dual-Unitary Quantum circuits with exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits can provide analytic spatiotemporal correlation functions of local operators from transfer matrices, enriching our understanding of quantum dynamics with exact solutions. Nevertheless, a full understanding is still lacking as the case of a non-diagonalizable transfer matrix with exceptional points has less been investigated. In this paper, we give an inverse approach for constructing dual-unitary quantum circuits with exceptional points in the transfer matrices, by establishing relations between transfer matrices and local unitary gates. As a consequence of the coalesce of eigenvectors, the correlation functions exhibit a polynomial modified exponential decay, which is significantly different from pure exponential decay, especially at early stages. Moreover, we point out that the Hamiltonian evolution of a kicked XXZ spin chain can be approximately mapped to a dual-unitary circuit with exceptional points by Trotter decomposition. Finally, we investigate the dynamics approaching and at exceptional points, showing that behaviors of correlation functions are distinct by Laplace transformation.</description>

      <title>Wave function matching transformation for solving the quantum many-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for solving quantum many-body systems called wave function matching. Wave function matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wave functions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancelations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental viability of cooling ultracold atomic gases with quantum feedback control. Our study shows that the trade-off between the resolution and destructiveness of optical imaging techniques imposes constraints on the efficacy of feedback cooling, and that rapid rethermalization is necessary for cooling thermal gases. We construct a simple model to determine the limits to feedback cooling set by the visibility of density fluctuations, measurement-induced heating, and three-body atomic recombination. We demonstrate that feedback control can rapidly cool high-temperature thermal clouds in quasi-2D geometries to degenerate temperatures with minimal atom loss compared to traditional evaporation. Our analysis confirms the feasibility of feedback cooling ultracold atomic gases, providing a pathway to new regimes of cooling not achievable with current approaches.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical descriptions of dissipative dynamics of strongly interacting Bose gases in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop semiclassical methods for describing real-time dynamics of dissipative Bose-Hubbard systems in a strongly interacting regime, which can be realized in experiments with ultracold gases. Specifically, we present two kinds of SU(3) truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for solving an effective Lindblad master equation of the systems. The first one employs the discrete TWA for finite levels or spin systems and is based on a classical equation of motion in which the onsite dissipation term, as well as the onsite interaction term, is linearized in the phase space variables. The other approach utilizes a stochastic Langevin equation, including decoherence effects in terms of nonlinear drift force and stochastic force terms, in which the initial conditions of trajectories are weighted with a quasiprobability distribution for a typical initial quantum state. We apply these methods to the systems with two-body losses and compare their results with the exact numerical solutions for a small system. We show that the former approach can simulate correctly longer-time dynamics than the latter one. We also calculate the time evolution for a large size setup that is comparable to experiments. We numerically demonstrate that the discrete TWA approach is able to qualitatively capture the continuous quantum Zeno effect on dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the superfluid-Mott insulator crossover, which has been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>
