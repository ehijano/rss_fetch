      <title>Adaptive Coded Federated Learning: Privacy Preservation and Straggler Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of federated learning in the presence of stragglers. For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>A task of anomaly detection for a smart satellite Internet of things system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the equipment is working, real-time collection of environmental sensor data for anomaly detection is one of the key links to prevent industrial process accidents and network attacks and ensure system security. However, under the environment with specific real-time requirements, the anomaly detection for environmental sensors still faces the following difficulties: (1) The complex nonlinear correlation characteristics between environmental sensor data variables lack effective expression methods, and the distribution between the data is difficult to be captured. (2) it is difficult to ensure the real-time monitoring requirements by using complex machine learning models, and the equipment cost is too high. (3) Too little sample data leads to less labeled data in supervised learning. This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system. Based on the generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism, considering the different feature information contained in the local subsequences, it automatically learns the complex linear and nonlinear dependencies between environmental sensor variables, and uses the anomaly score calculation method combining reconstruction error and discrimination error. It can monitor the abnormal points of real sensor data with high real-time performance and can run on the intelligent satellite Internet of things system, which is suitable for the real working environment. Anomaly detection outperforms baseline methods in most cases and has good interpretability, which can be used to prevent industrial accidents and cyber-attacks for monitoring environmental sensors.</description>

      <title>Improving Galileo OSNMA Time To First Authenticated Fix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galileo is the first global navigation satellite system to authenticate their civilian signals through the Open Service Galileo Message Authentication (OSNMA) protocol. However, OSNMA delays the time to obtain a first position and time fix, the so-called Time To First Authentication Fix (TTFAF). Reducing the TTFAF as much as possible is crucial to integrate the technology seamlessly into the current products. In the cases where the receiver already has cryptographic data available, the so-called hot start mode and focus of this article, the currently available implementations achieve an average TTFAF of around 100 seconds in ideal environments. In this work, we dissect the TTFAF process, propose two main optimizations to reduce the TTFAF, and benchmark them in three distinct scenarios (open-sky, soft urban, and hard urban) with recorded real data. Moreover, we evaluate the optimizations using the synthetic scenario from the official OSNMA test vectors. The first block of optimizations centers on extracting as much information as possible from broken sub-frames by processing them at page level and combining redundant data from multiple satellites. The second block of optimizations aims to reconstruct missed navigation data by using fields in the authentication tags belonging to the same sub-frame as the authentication key. Combining both optimizations improves the TTFAF substantially for all considered scenarios. We obtain an average TTFAF of 60.9 and 68.8 seconds for the test vectors and the open-sky scenario, respectively, with a best-case of 44.0 seconds in both. Likewise, the urban scenarios see a drastic reduction of the average TTFAF between the non-optimized and optimized cases, from 127.5 to 87.5 seconds in the soft urban scenario and from 266.1 to 146.1 seconds in the hard urban scenario. These optimizations are available as part of the open-source OSNMAlib library on GitHub.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing: Computation Efficiency Maximization via Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, the wireless channel condition is a critical factor affecting both the communication power consumption and computation rate of the offloading tasks. This paper exploits the idea of cooperative transmission and employing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in MEC to improve the channel condition and maximize computation efficiency (CE). The resulting problem couples various wireless resources in both uplink and downlink, which calls for the joint design of the user association, receive/downlink beamforming vectors, transmit power of users, task partition strategies for local computing and offloading, and uplink/downlink phase shifts at the RIS. To tackle the challenges brought by the combinatorial optimization problem, the group sparsity structure of the beamforming vectors determined by user association is exploited. Furthermore, while the CE does not explicitly depend on the downlink phase shifts, instead of simply finding a feasible solution, we exploit the hidden relationship between them and convert this relationship into an explicit form for optimization. Then the resulting problem is solved via the alternating maximization framework, and the nonconvexity of each subproblem is handled individually. Simulation results show that cooperative transmission and RIS deployment can significantly improve the CE and demonstrate the importance of optimizing the downlink phase shifts with an explicit form.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourced Multilingual Speech Intelligibility Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of generative audio features, there is an increasing need for rapid evaluation of their impact on speech intelligibility. Beyond the existing laboratory measures, which are expensive and do not scale well, there has been comparatively little work on crowdsourced assessment of intelligibility. Standards and recommendations are yet to be defined, and publicly available multilingual test materials are lacking. In response to this challenge, we propose an approach for a crowdsourced intelligibility assessment. We detail the test design, the collection and public release of the multilingual speech data, and the results of our early experiments.</description>

      <title>Secure Outage Analysis for RIS-Aided MISO Systems with Randomly Located Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system with randomly located eavesdroppers. The exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and a closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is obtained. It is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, and the impact of the transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. We also perform an analytical study demonstrating that the secrecy diversity order depends on the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Primary Rate Maximization in Movable Antennas Empowered Symbiotic Radio Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA) empowered scheme for symbiotic radio (SR) communication systems. Specifically, multiple antennas at the primary transmitter (PT) can be flexibly moved to favorable locations to boost the channel conditions of the primary and secondary transmissions. The primary transmission is achieved by the active transmission from the PT to the primary user (PU), while the backscatter device (BD) takes a ride over the incident signal from the PT to passively send the secondary signal to the PU. Under this setup, we consider a primary rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the positions of MAs at the PT under a practical bit error rate constraint on the secondary transmission. Then, an alternating optimization framework with the utilization of the successive convex approximation, semi-definite processing and simulated annealing (SA) modified particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) methods is proposed to find the solution of the transmit beamforming and MAs' positions. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement provided by the proposed MA empowered scheme and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Range-Angle Estimation for FDA-MIMO System With Frequency Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar differs from the traditional phased array (PA) radar, and can form range-angle-dependent beampattern and differentiate between closely spaced targets sharing the same angle but occupying distinct range cells. In the FDA-MIMO radar, target range estimation is achieved by employing a subtle frequency variation between adjacent array antennas, so the estimation performance is degraded severely in a practical scenario with frequency offset. In this paper, the range-angle estimation problem for FDA-MIMO radar is considered with frequency offsets in both transmitting and receiving arrays. First, we build a system model for the FDA-MIMO radar with transmitting and receiving frequency offsets. Then, the frequency offset is transferred into an equalized additional noise. The noise characteristics are analyzed in detail theoretically, together with the influence on the range-angle estimation. Moreover, since the effect of the transmitting frequency offset is similar to additional colored noise, denoising algorithms are introduced to mitigate the performance deterioration caused by the frequency offset. Finally, Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for the range-angle estimation are derived in the scenario with the frequency offsets. Simulation results show the analysis of frequency offset and the corresponding estimation performance using different algorithms.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Assisted Downlink Active and Uplink Backscatter Communications with NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted downlink (DL) active and uplink (UL) backscatter communication (BackCom) framework is proposed. More particularly, a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) communicates with the DL users via the STAR-RIS's transmission link, while exciting and receiving the information from the UL BackCom devices with the aid of the STAR-RIS's reflection link. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited in both DL and UL communications for improving the spectrum efficiency. The system weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the FD BS active receive and transmit beamforming, the STAR- RIS passive beamforming, and the DL NOMA decoding orders, subject to the DL user's individual rate constraint. To tackle this challenging non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm for the joint active and passive beamforming design with a given DL NOMA decoding order. To address the potential high computational complexity required for exhaustive searching all the NOMA decoding orders, an efficient NOMA user ordering scheme is further developed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) compared with the baseline schemes employing conventional RISs or space division multiple access, the proposed scheme achieves higher performance gains; and ii) higher UL rate gain is obtained at a cost of DL performance degradation, as a remedy, a more flexible performance tradeoff can be achieved by introducing the STAR-RIS.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Passive RIS and Active Relay Assisted NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel coexisting passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and active decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission framework is proposed. In particular, two communication protocols are conceived, namely Hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) and Full NOMA (F-NOMA). Based on the proposed two protocols, both the sum rate maximization and max-min rate fairness problems are formulated for jointly optimizing the power allocation at the access point and relay as well as the passive beamforming design at the RIS. To tackle the non-convex problems, an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is first developed, where the transmit power and the RIS phase-shift are alternatingly optimized by leveraging the two-dimensional search and rank-relaxed difference-of-convex (DC) programming, respectively. Then, a two-layer penalty based joint optimization (JO) algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the resource allocation coefficients within each iteration. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed coexisting RIS and relay assisted transmission framework is capable of achieving a significant user performance improvement than conventional schemes without RIS or relay; ii) compared with the AO algorithm, the JO algorithm requires less execution time at the cost of a slight performance loss; and iii) the H-NOMA and F-NOMA protocols are generally preferable for ensuring user rate fairness and enhancing user sum rate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Uplink soft handover for LEO constellations: how strong the inter-satellite link should be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a constellation of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites connected to a handheld device on the ground. Due to the very large orbital speed, an effective handover strategy becomes of paramount importance. In particular, we study the benefits of soft handover in the uplink from the physical-layer point of view. We give a realistic model for both the ground-to-satellite and the inter-satellite links, following the 3GPP channel model for the former. We suppose that, during handover from a serving satellite to a target satellite, one of the two satellites forwards the received signal from the ground user to the other, thus acting as a relay. We quantify through simulations the loss of hard handover, compared to soft handover. For the latter, we test both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques and verify that, at least in the simulated conditions, DF does not repay, in terms of block error rate (BLER), the increase of complexity with respect to AF. Also, we study the effect of the LEO constellation size on the network BLER. Finally, we show that, with soft handover, the impact of misalignment on the inter-satellite link is severe, especially at optical frequencies.</description>

      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for STAR-RIS Assisted SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is proposed. More particularly, an STAR-RIS is deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), where two practical STAR-RIS operating protocols, namely energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), are employed. Under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) condition, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework, that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested power, is employed to investigate the fundamental rate-energy trade-off between IUs and EUs. To obtain the optimal robust resource allocation strategy, the MOOP is first transformed into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the {\epsilon}-constraint method, which is then reformulated by approximating semi-infinite inequality constraints with the S-procedure. For ES, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to jointly design AP active beamforming and STAR-RIS passive beamforming, where a penalty method is leveraged in STAR-RIS beamforming design. Furthermore, the developed algorithm is extended to optimize the time allocation policy and beamforming vectors in a two-layer iterative manner for TS. Numerical results reveal that: 1) deploying STAR-RISs achieves a significant performance gain over conventional RISs, especially in terms of harvested power for EUs; 2) the ES protocol obtains a better user fairness performance when focusing only on IUs or EUs, while the TS protocol yields a better balance between IUs and EUs; 3) the imperfect CSI affects IUs more significantly than EUs, whereas TS can confer a more robust design to attenuate these effects.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization with Reconfigurable Surfaces: General Models, Theoretical Limits, and Effective Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We envision a future in which multi-antenna technology effectively exploits the spatial domain as a set of non-interfering orthogonal resources, allowing for flexible resource allocation and efficient modulation/demodulation. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology which allows shaping the propagation environment for improved performance. This paper studies the ability of three extended types of reconfigurable surface (RS), including the recently proposed beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to achieve perfectly orthogonal channels in a general multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario. We propose practical implementations for the three types of RS consisting of passive components, and obtain the corresponding restrictions on their reconfigurability. We then use these restrictions to derive closed-form conditions for achieving arbitrary (orthogonal) channels. We also study the problem of optimal orthogonal channel selection for achieving high channel gain without active amplification at the RS, and we propose some methods with satisfying performance. Finally, we provide efficient channel estimation and RS configuration techniques such that all the computation, including the channel selection, may be performed at the base station (BS). The numerical results showcase the potential and practicality of RS channel orthogonalization, thus taking a step towards orthogonal spatial domain multiplexing (OSDM).</description>

      <title>Exploring the Task-agnostic Trait of Self-supervised Learning in the Context of Detecting Mental Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been investigated to generate task-agnostic representations across various domains. However, such investigation has not been conducted for detecting multiple mental disorders. The rationale behind the existence of a task-agnostic representation lies in the overlapping symptoms among multiple mental disorders. Consequently, the behavioural data collected for mental health assessment may carry a mixed bag of attributes related to multiple disorders. Motivated by that, in this study, we explore a task-agnostic representation derived through SSL in the context of detecting major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using audio and video data collected during interactive sessions. This study employs SSL models trained by predicting multiple fixed targets or masked frames. We propose a list of fixed targets to make the generated representation more efficient for detecting MDD and PTSD. Furthermore, we modify the hyper-parameters of the SSL encoder predicting fixed targets to generate global representations that capture varying temporal contexts. Both these innovations are noted to yield improved detection performances for considered mental disorders and exhibit task-agnostic traits. In the context of the SSL model predicting masked frames, the generated global representations are also noted to exhibit task-agnostic traits.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Successive Interference Cancellation for Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is used to approach the achievable information rates (AIRs) of joint detection and decoding for long-haul optical fiber links. The AIRs of memoryless ring constellations are compared to those of circularly symmetric complex Gaussian modulation for surrogate channel models with correlated phase noise. Simulations are performed for 1000 km of standard single-mode fiber with ideal Raman amplification. In this setup, 32 rings and 16 SIC-stages with Gaussian message-passing receivers achieve the AIR peaks of previous work. The computational complexity scales in proportion to the number of SIC-stages, where one stage has the complexity of separate detection and decoding.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Predictive Maintenance: Systems, Purposes and Approaches</title>

Abstract: This paper highlights the importance of maintenance techniques in the coming industrial revolution, reviews the evolution of maintenance techniques, and presents a comprehensive literature review on the latest advancement of maintenance techniques, i.e., Predictive Maintenance (PdM), with emphasis on system architectures, optimization objectives, and optimization methods. In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting in significant penalties and immeasurable reputation and economic loss. Existing traditional maintenance approaches, such as Reactive Maintenance (RM) and Preventive Maintenance (PM), suffer from high prevent and repair costs, inadequate or inaccurate mathematical degradation processes, and manual feature extraction. The incoming fourth industrial revolution is also demanding for a new maintenance paradigm to reduce the maintenance cost and downtime, and increase system availability and reliability. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is envisioned the solution. In this survey, we first provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including PdM 4.0, Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), and cloud-enhanced PdM system. Then, we review the specific optimization objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization, availability/reliability maximization, and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we present the optimization methods to achieve the aforementioned objectives, which include traditional Machine Learning (ML) based and Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. Finally, we highlight the future research directions that are critical to promote the application of DL techniques in the context of PdM.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based One-Bit Maximum Likelihood Detection for Massive MIMO Systems: Dithering-Aided Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of -1 and +1 for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime are biased to either +1 or -1, and thus, the learning requires excessive training to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Solution-Set Geometry and Regularization Path of a Nonconvexly Regularized Convex Sparse Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized minimax concave (GMC) penalty is a nonconvex sparse regularizer which can preserve the overall-convexity of the regularized least-squares problem. In this paper, we focus on a significant instance of the GMC model termed scaled GMC (sGMC), and present various notable findings on its solution-set geometry and regularization path. Our investigation indicates that while the sGMC penalty is a nonconvex extension of the LASSO penalty (i.e., the $\ell_1$-norm), the sGMC model preserves many celebrated properties of the LASSO model, hence can serve as a less biased surrogate of LASSO without losing its advantages. Specifically, for a fixed regularization parameter $\lambda$, we show that the solution-set geometry, solution uniqueness and sparseness of the sGMC model can be characterized in a similar elegant way to the LASSO model (see, e.g., Osborne et al. 2000, R. J. Tibshirani 2013). For a varying $\lambda$, we prove that the sGMC solution set is a continuous polytope-valued mapping of $\lambda$. Most noticeably, our study indicates that similar to LASSO, the minimum $\ell_2$-norm regularization path of the sGMC model is continuous and piecewise linear in $\lambda$. Based on these theoretical results, an efficient regularization path algorithm is proposed for the sGMC model, extending the well-known least angle regression (LARS) algorithm for LASSO. We prove the correctness and finite termination of the proposed algorithm under a mild assumption, and confirm its correctness-in-general-situation, efficiency, and practical utility through numerical experiments. Many results in this study also contribute to the theoretical research of LASSO.</description>

      <title>On Secrecy Performance of RIS-Assisted MISO Systems over Rician Channels with Spatially Random Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is emerging as a promising technique for performance enhancement for next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system in the presence of random spatially distributed eavesdroppers. The RIS-to-ground channels are assumed to experience Rician fading. Using stochastic geometry, exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) are obtained to provide insightful guidelines for system design. First, the secrecy diversity order is obtained as $\frac{2}{\alpha_2}$, where $\alpha_2$ denotes the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Then, it is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, $N$, and the impact of the number of transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, it is also found that the density of randomly located eavesdroppers, $\lambda_e$, has an additive effect on the asymptotic ESC performance given by $\log_2{\left({1}/{\lambda_e}\right)}$. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Detection Is Tracking: Point Cloud Multi-Sweep Deep Learning Models Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional tracking paradigm takes in instantaneous measurements such as range and bearing, and produces object tracks across time. In applications such as autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are usually passed through a "virtual sensor" realized by a deep learning model, to produce "measurements" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a tracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We argue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information, and therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal information, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the end of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called MULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object, a pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the input buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly used lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the resulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not only to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct more sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by the pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death models. We have conducted preliminary training and experimentation using Waymo Open Dataset, which shows the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Rate Analysis for Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology for next-generation cellular networks, offering mutual benefits in both sensing and communication capabilities. This advancement necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental limits within networks where these two functions coexist via shared spectrum and infrastructures. However, traditional stochastic geometry-based performance analyses are confined to either communication or sensing networks separately. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a generalized stochastic geometry framework in ISAC networks. Based on this framework, we define and calculate the coverage and ergodic rate of sensing and communication performance under resource constraints. Then, we shed light on the fundamental limits of ISAC networks by presenting theoretical results for the coverage rate of the unified performance, taking into account the coupling effects of dual functions in coexistence networks. Further, we obtain the analytical formulations for evaluating the ergodic sensing rate constrained by the maximum communication rate, and the ergodic communication rate constrained by the maximum sensing rate. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of all theoretical derivations, and also indicate that denser networks significantly enhance ISAC coverage. Specifically, increasing the base station density from $1$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ to $10$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ can boost the ISAC coverage rate from $1.4\%$ to $39.8\%$. Further, results also reveal that with the increase of the constrained sensing rate, the ergodic communication rate improves significantly, but the reverse is not obvious.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-informed ECG Dual Attention Network for Heart Failure Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant public health challenge, with a rising global mortality rate. Early detection and prevention of HF could significantly reduce its impact. We introduce a novel methodology for predicting HF risk using 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We present a novel, lightweight dual-attention ECG network designed to capture complex ECG features essential for early HF risk prediction, despite the notable imbalance between low and high-risk groups. This network incorporates a cross-lead attention module and twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules, focusing on cross-lead interactions and each lead's local dynamics. To further alleviate model overfitting, we leverage a large language model (LLM) with a public ECG-Report dataset for pretraining on an ECG-report alignment task. The network is then fine-tuned for HF risk prediction using two specific cohorts from the UK Biobank study, focusing on patients with hypertension (UKB-HYP) and those who have had a myocardial infarction (UKB-MI).The results reveal that LLM-informed pre-training substantially enhances HF risk prediction in these cohorts. The dual-attention design not only improves interpretability but also predictive accuracy, outperforming existing competitive methods with C-index scores of 0.6349 for UKB-HYP and 0.5805 for UKB-MI. This demonstrates our method's potential in advancing HF risk assessment with clinical complex ECG data.</description>
