      <title>Anderson localisation in spatially structured random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Anderson localisation on high-dimensional graphs with spatial structure induced by long-ranged but distance-dependent hopping. To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.</description>

      <title>Classical vs quantum dynamics and the onset of chaos in a macrospin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Origin of geometric cohesion in non-convex granular materials: interplay between interdigitation and rotational constraints enhancing frictional stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of experiments investigating the local microstructure of cylindrical piles composed of highly concave particles. By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.</description>

      <title>Symmetric approximant formalism for statistical topological matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to characterizing topological matter, computing topological invariants, fails when the symmetry protecting the topological phase is preserved only on average in a disordered system. Because topological invariants rely on enforcing the symmetry exactly, they can overcount phases by incorrectly identifying certain non-robust features as robust. Moreover, in intrinsic statistical topological insulators, enforcing the symmetry exactly is guaranteed to destroy the topological phase. We define a mapping that addresses both issues and provides a unified framework for describing disordered topological matter.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for deep neural networks: Universality of learning and scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similarity, where observables at different length scales exhibit similar behavior, is ubiquitous in natural systems. Such systems are typically characterized by power-law correlations and universality, and are studied using the powerful framework of the renormalization group (RG). Intriguingly, power laws and weak forms of universality also pervade real-world datasets and deep learning models, motivating the application of RG ideas to the analysis of deep learning. In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG. In particular, we find that the concept of scaling intervals naturally replaces that of scaling dimensions. Despite these differences, the framework retains key RG features: it enables the classification of perturbations as relevant or irrelevant, and reveals a form of universality at large data limits, governed by a Gaussian Process-like UV fixed point.</description>

      <title>Local Hall Conductivity in Disordered Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the expression for the local Hall conductivity for systems that lack translation symmetry and use it to study the local fluctuations of the Hall signal around disordered patches in magnetic insulators. We find that the regime in parameter space over which the system is a Chern insulating state increases upon inclusion of non-magnetic potential disorder. In addition, the phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches with the same total amount of disorder. We expect our results will motivate the next generation of local scanning and local impedance spectroscopy experiments to visualize Hall currents around patches in the bulk of a disordered topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene cavities where electrons are confined within finite graphene flakes provide an alluring platform not only for the future nanoelectronic devices owing to the tunable energy gap but also for investigating the quantum nature of chaos due to the trigonal warping of their Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that rotating the cavity boundary relative to the underlying lattice structure drives a quantum transition from nearly integrable dynamics to chaotic regime, observed as a concomitant crossover of eigenvalue statistics and eigenstate profiles. Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics. Our results position bilayer graphene cavities as a promising venue for investigating and engineering quantum-chaotic behavior in graphene-based devices.</description>
