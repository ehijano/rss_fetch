      <title>Verification of E-Voting Algorithms in Dafny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic voting procedures are implementations of electoral systems, making it possible to conduct polls or elections with the help of computers. This paper reports on the development of an open-source library of electronic voting procedures, which currently covers Score Voting, Instant-Runoff Voting, Borda Count, and Single Transferable Vote. The four procedures, of which two are discussed in detail, have been implemented in Dafny, formally verifying the consistency with functional specifications and key correctness properties. Using code extraction from the Dafny implementation, the library has been used to set up a voting web service.</description>

      <title>Declarative distributed broadcast using three-valued modal logic and semitopologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.</description>

      <title>Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.</description>

      <title>Note on a Translation from First-Order Logic into the Calculus of Relations Preserving Validity and Finite Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02845v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we give a linear-size translation from formulas of first-order logic into equations of the calculus of relations preserving validity and finite validity. Our translation also gives a linear-size conservative reduction from formulas of first-order logic into formulas of the three-variable fragment of first-order logic.</description>

      <title>The free bifibration on a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing the free bifibration generated by a functor of categories $p : D \to C$. This problem was previously considered by Lamarche, and is closely related to the problem, considered by Dawson, Par\'e, and Pronk, of "freely adjoining adjoints" to a category. We develop a proof-theoretic approach to the problem, beginning with a construction of the free bifibration $\Lambda_p : Bif(p)\to C$ in which objects of $Bif(p)$ are formulas of a primitive "bifibrational logic", and arrows are derivations in a cut-free sequent calculus modulo a notion of permutation equivalence. We show that instantiating the construction to the identity functor generates a _zigzag double category_ $\mathbb{Z}(C)$, which is also the free double category with companions and conjoints (or fibrant double category) on $C$. The approach adapts smoothly to the more general task of building $(P,N)$-fibrations, where one only asks for pushforwards along arrows in $P$ and pullbacks along arrows in $N$ for some subsets of arrows, which encompasses Kock and Joyal's notion of _ambifibration_ when $(P,N)$ form a factorization system. We establish a series of progressively stronger normal forms, guided by ideas of _focusing_ from proof theory, and obtain a canonicity result under assumption that the base category is factorization preordered relative to $P$ and $N$. This canonicity result allows us to decide the word problem and to enumerate relative homsets without duplicates. Finally, we describe several examples of a combinatorial nature, including a category of plane trees generated as a free bifibration over $\omega$, and a category of increasing forests generated as a free ambifibration over $\Delta$, which contains the lattices of noncrossing partitions as quotients of its fibers by the Beck-Chevalley condition.</description>
