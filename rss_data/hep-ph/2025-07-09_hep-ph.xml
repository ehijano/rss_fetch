      <title>Generalised Non-Linear Electrodynamics: classical picture and effective mass generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a generic Lagrangian, we discuss the number of propagating degrees of freedom in the framework of generalised non-linear electrodynamics when a photon-background split is applied. We start by stating results obtained in a previous paper, before modifying the action to an equivalent form. Within this new formulation, we highlight the presence of an effective mass and consider the mechanical reduction of the model to ensure the positivity of said mass. We then study the constraint algebra of the model and show that we shift from a model with two first-class to two second-class constraints, which implies the propagation of an additional degree of freedom. We also show that the Hamiltonian is bound from below and thus does not suffer from Ostrogradski-type instabilities. We conclude by deriving the propagator for the model, and discussing the potential link between the nature of this additional polarisation and the mechanism behind the effective mass generation in this class of models.</description>

      <title>Partial Compositeness: from Anarchy to Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Composite Higgs paradigm, Partial Compositeness has emerged as an elegant mechanism for generating large flavor hierarchies such as are observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings. This mechanism exploits the strong renormalization group effects of the compositeness dynamics when these are {\it not} flavor-symmetric. Despite its remarkable properties, at this point it is stringently constrained by the body of flavor- and CP-violation tests, so that the compositeness scale must be at least $O(100)$ TeV, beyond the direct reach of proposed colliders. On the other hand, Composite Higgs theories with flavor-symmetric strong dynamics, but with realistic flavor-violating hierarchies introduced in an ad hoc manner, can extend the GIM mechanism of the standard model and thereby be far less constrained, at the edge of LHC reach and well within reach of future colliders. We show how the best features of both these types of dynamics can be combined if flavor-symmetries of the strong composite dynamics are emergent in the IR near the compositeness scale but absent in the far UV. In this case, flavor hierarchies can be generated by the renormalization group flow in the UV, followed by an IR stage in which the dynamics flows towards accidental flavor and CP symmetries. We point out how the collider and low-energy phenomenology is significantly impacted by the IR stage. Our analysis includes a discussion of the distinctive features of the small neutrino masses and their large mixings.</description>

      <title>Searching for top-philic heavy resonances in boosted four-top final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New heavy resonances with sizeable couplings to top quarks can be probed through searches for beyond-the-Standard-Model effects in four-top production at the LHC. In this work, we present the first next-to-leading-order QCD predictions for the full on-shell and off-shell production of four-top events via new physics contributions, along with dedicated analysis strategies based on the reconstruction and tagging of all final-state top quarks. We develop a detector-level simulation incorporating recent advances in top-tagging and boosted object reconstruction, and demonstrate that searches at LHC Run~3 and high-luminosity phase can improve the sensitivity to the new physics cross sections by up to two orders of magnitude. In particular, colour-octet resonances with masses up to 2-2.5~TeV and colour-singlet states with masses up to 1-1.5~TeV are within reach for coupling values in the 0.1-1 range.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Photon Polarization Twist to Probe the Early Universe and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that gravitational wave backgrounds (GWBs) change the polarization state of photons. This letter explores the possibility of using this effect to detect GWBs. The proposed experiment features a vertically polarized laser pulse traveling through a GWB before reaching a birefringent material which separates photons by polarization. Photons that emerge the birefringent material horizontally polarized are counted as signal photons. A space-based setup of a million km (comparable to the LISA mission) with a millisecond laser pulse is capable to detect the hypothetical pulsars responsible for the excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. Varying the duration of the pulse can reveal a variety of GWBs from the early Universe as well.</description>

      <title>Impact of First-order Electroweak Phase Transition on QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion addresses the strong CP problem and dark matter via the misalignment mechanism, typically requiring a decay constant $f_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{12}$ GeV), unless the initial misalignment angle ($\theta_i$) is fine-tuned. This work presents a novel approach where the possibility that the QCD axion satisfying the correct relic is extended over a broad range for $f_a\in [10^8, 10^{14}$] GeV without fine-tuning the $\theta_i$, by introducing a new phase of axion oscillation dynamics across the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). This mechanism, we call it {\it{recurrent ~misalignment}}, is a result of a non-renormalizable Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking interaction involving the axion and the sector responsible for making the EWPT of first order. The scenario not only enhances the QCD axion parameter space in terms of its detection possibility, but also provides a unique probe by detectable gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Spin Dependence of Meson Thresholds in the Diabatic Dynamical Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diabatic dynamical diquark model is designed to unify diquark and molecular approaches for exotic hadrons, by including the effects of di-meson thresholds on fundamental diquark-antidiquark states in order to form physical tetraquarks. We generalize this model by implementing the consequences of heavy-quark spin symmetry for each di-meson pair. We include the specific spin factors and mass differences associated with mesons related by this symmetry (such as $D, D^*$), both features being necessary for the systematic incorporation of effects beyond the static, heavy-source limit inherent to the (adiabatic) Born-Oppenheimer treatment. We obtain explicit interaction potentials for all $J = 0, 1, 2$ states, along the way deriving unusual variants of Fierz reordering identities, and discuss the application of the potentials to specific physical states such as $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $T_{c\bar c 1}(3900)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and nucleons from dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and the nucleons are investigated by employing modern dispersive techniques and chiral perturbation theory. We determine the gravitational form factors of pions and kaons, extending our analysis to explore the pion mass dependence of these form factors at several unphysical pion masses up to 391 MeV, for which lattice results exist for the meson-meson scattering phase shifts. We also review our analysis on the nucleon gravitational form factors at the physical pion mass, and then systematically calculate various three-dimensional spatial and two-dimensional transverse density distributions for the nucleons. These results provide new insights into the mass distribution inside nucleons. As a by-product, we match our dispersion relation results and those obtained from chiral perturbation theory with external gravitational source at the next-to-next-to-leading order, yielding values for the low-energy constants $c_8=-4.28_{-0.38}^{+0.37} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $c_9=-0.68_{-0.05}^{+0.06} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. These results offer a robust benchmark for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>New limits on CPT-Symmetry Violation in Charm mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral flavour meson oscillations are a fascinating quantum phenomenon that allows for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries, including CPT invariance. In this contribution, we present the methodology for testing CPT violation in neutral flavour meson systems, with particular emphasis on the charm sector. We report the recently established constraints on CPT-violating effects, derived from a reinterpretation of the LHCb measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in the Cabibbo-favoured decays $D^0 \to K^- \pi^+$ and $\bar{D}^0 \to K^+ \pi^-$. Our results improve the previous bounds by the FOCUS experiment by approximately two orders of magnitude. We also discuss prospects for tests of CPT invariance, including the Standard Model Extension framework.</description>

      <title>Heavy Mesons to Charmed Tetraquark Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of $T^*_{cs0}(2870)^0$, $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^0$ and $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^{++}$ charmed tetraquark states by LHCb, we study the decays of heavy mesons to these charmed tetraquark states ($T$) using a topological amplitude approach. We first obtain the $T\to DP$ and $DS$ strong decay amplitudes by decomposing them into several topological amplitudes, where $P$ is a light psedo-scalar particle and $S$ is a low-lying scalar particle. Later on, weak decay amplitudes of $\overline B\to D\overline T$, $\overline D T$ and $\overline B\to TP$, $TS$ decays are also decomposed topologically. In addition, $B^-_c\to T\overline T$ decays are also discussed. Using these results, modes with an unambiguous exotic interpretation in flavor are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Tribrid Inflation, Type II Leptogenesis, and Observable Gravitational Waves in $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concrete realization of tribrid inflation within the framework of the gauge group $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. In this model, inflation is driven by the neutral components of left-handed Higgs triplets, which also play a central role in generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via non-thermal leptogenesis. Tiny neutrino masses arise naturally through a type-II seesaw mechanism, facilitated by right-handed triplet fields. Supergravity corrections, stemming from the leading-order terms in a non-minimal K\"ahler potential, are essential in bringing the predictions of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into agreement with the latest cosmological data, including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018, and LB-BK18. A key feature of this model is the existence of a viable parameter space that predicts potentially observable primordial gravitational waves, with a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.005$, placing it within reach of upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>$WWh$ anomalous couplings at one loop from a seesaw variant of radiatively-induced neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Investigating the transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent flow vector decorrelation in p--Pb collisions with a Multi-Phase Transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event-by-event fluctuations in the initial energy density of the nuclear collisions lead to the decorrelation of second order flow vector, as known as its transverse-momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) dependence as observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Existing measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider shown that these decorrelations are also observed in small collision systems. In this work, a systematic study of the transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent flow vector decorrelation is performed in p--Pb collisions at the 5.02 TeV with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model using different tunings of the initial conditions, partonic and hadronic interactions. It is found that the string-melting version of the AMPT model provides a reasonable description of the measured flow vector decorrelation as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\eta$. We demonstrate that the hadronic scatterings do not have significant impact on decorrelation in p--Pb collisions for different centrality selections, while both initial conditions and partonic interactions influence the magnitude of the decorrelations. In addition, we found that the subtraction of the nonflow, especially the long-range jet correlation, is crucial for the accurate extraction of the flow vector decorrelation in small collision systems. The comparison of data and model presented in this paper provide further insights in understanding the fluctuations of the flow vector with $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\eta$ in small collision systems and has referential value for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Temporal Incompatibility of Quantum Superposition and Relativistic Causality in Toponium Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, faces a stringent test in toponium formation. Quantum superposition predicts instantaneous projection into bound states upon top quark pair creation, while relativistic causality requires a finite formation time of $\sim n^3 \times 10^{-25}$ s for the $nS$ states. This temporal conflict challenges the coexistence of wavelike and particlelike behavior at ultrashort timescales. Exploiting the top quark's intrinsic lifetime ($\tau_t \sim 5 \times 10^{-25}$ s) as a quantum chronometer, we simulate the cross-section ratio $R_b = \sigma(e^+e^- \to b\bar{b})/\sum_q \sigma(e^+e^- \to q\bar{q})$ ($q = u,d,s,c,b$) near $\sqrt{s} = 343$ GeV at future lepton colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee). Wavelike and particlelike scenarios yield distinct $R_b$ profiles, enabling $&gt;5\sigma$ discrimination with 1500 fb$^{-1}$ of data. Preliminary LHC data provide independent $2$--$3\sigma$ support. This framework establishes a collider-based probe of quantum state formation with yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$ s) resolution, offering new insight into wavefunction collapse and relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Unraveling $K(1690)$ as a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observed $K (1690)$ has been identified as a supernumerary pseudoscalar resonance signal in the strange-meson spectrum predicted by quark model calculations. It is the best candidate of a strange crypto-exotic state. In this work, we systematically study the hadron masses of $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^P = 0^-$ in the method of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). For ten interpolating currents, we calculate the correlation functions up to dimension-8 nonperturbative condensates. To calculate the tri-gluon condensate, we comprehensively consider the contributions from different operators with and without covariant derivatives. The infrared (IR) safety can be guaranteed for the completely calculated tri-gluon condensate by properly addressing the IR divergences in Feynman diagrams. It is demonstrated that the tri-gluon condensate provides significant contributions to the sum-rule analyses in these light tetraquark systems. Our results support the interpretation of $K (1690)$ resonance to be a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for $\mathcal{CP}$ violation in Higgs interactions at the LHC is as challenging as it is important. Although modern machine learning outperforms traditional methods, its results are difficult to control and interpret, which is especially important if an unambiguous probe of a fundamental symmetry is required. We propose solving this problem by learning analytic formulas with symbolic regression. Using the complementary PySR and SymbolNet approaches, we learn $\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive observables at the detector level for WBF Higgs production and top-associated Higgs production. We find that they offer advantages in interpretability and performance.</description>

      <title>Topped baryons from QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent CMS observation of a near-threshold enhancement in top quark pair production provides the first experimental indication of a short-lived pseudoscalar $t\bar{t}$ bound state, commonly referred to as toponium. While most existing studies focus on toponium using perturbative QCD near threshold, baryonic configurations containing a single top quark -- singly topped baryons -- offer a complementary nonperturbative perspective. Notably, singly topped baryons are expected to exhibit a longer lifetime and a narrower decay width than toponium, since only one top quark decays rather than two. The heavy quark effective theory provides a natural and powerful framework for analyzing such systems, allowing the separation of heavy and light quark dynamics. In this work we employ heavy quark effective theory to investigate the internal structure of ground-state singly topped baryons. We construct their interpolating currents and analyze them using QCD sum rules. The resulting masses of the ground-state singly topped baryons are found to lie around 174 GeV, approximately $1.1$-$1.5$ GeV above the pole mass of the top quark.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition, Gravitational Waves and Collider Probes in Multi-Scalar Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scalar singlet extensions of the Standard Model (SM), focusing on scenarios where dark matter (DM) is stabilized by a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) symmetry. In the minimal single-scalar extension of the SM, only a narrow region near the Higgs resonance remains viable, requiring small portal couplings in order to simultaneously satisfy the observed relic abundance and comply with the most recent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ-2024) and XENON1T experiments. To address this limitation, we extend the dark sector by introducing additional real singlet scalars. In both two- and three-singlet extensions, we demonstrate that the observed dark matter relic density can be accommodated with larger Higgs portal couplings. These couplings significantly impact early-Universe dynamics by enhancing the strength of the electroweak phase transition. Both the two- and three-singlet scalar extensions can induce a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating stochastic gravitational waves potentially observable at future space-based detectors such as LISA and DECIGO. Notably, the three-singlet scenario induce an even stronger transition compared to the two-singlet case, enhancing the gravitational wave signal strength. Our results highlight the potential of extended scalar sectors as testable frameworks connecting dark matter and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>V-Associated Production &amp; Vector Boson Fusion as an LHC Signature of CP Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of vector boson fusion (VBF) and associated production with an electroweak boson (V-AP) of beyond-the-Standard-Model Higgses at the LHC in probing CP violation in extended Higgs sectors. Resonant production of a new Higgs boson through V-AP/VBF subsequently decaying into a Z boson and a 125 GeV Higgs boson h would be a robust sign of CP violation, since h has been measured to be (predominantly) a CP-even state. After identifying this and other sets of signatures which rely on V-AP/VBF to jointly uncover CP violation, we analyze the prospects to measure CP violation in this way for the complex two-Higgs-doublet-model at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrino dark matter consistent with the generation of baryon number asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A right-handed neutrino is a promising candidate for dark matter (DM) which has no interaction with nuclei. Since two right-handed neutrinos explain neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry through seesaw mechanism and leptogenesis based on the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lighter one, the lightest third right-handed neutrino could be free from them and stable to be DM. It suggests a possibility that the right-handed neutrinos could be common key particles for the explanation of three problems in the standard model (SM). We study this possibility by analyzing the structure of a neutrino mass matrix in the scotogenic model for neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>A First Determination of the LHC Neutrino Fluxes from FASER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of TeV neutrinos from the LHC by the far-forward detectors FASER and SND@LHC enables a plethora of novel physics opportunities. Among these, the measurement of the flavour, energy, and rapidity dependence of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes provides unique constraints on theoretical predictions of forward particle production in hadronic collisions. We demonstrate that neutrino event yield measurements at FASER from Run 3 and at its HL-LHC upgrades enable a theory-agnostic extraction of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes. We exploit the equivalence of the problem with the determination of parton distributions from deep-inelastic structure functions to apply the NNPDF approach, based on machine learning regression and the Monte Carlo replica method, to LHC neutrino fluxes. The resulting NN$\nu$flux methodology is validated through closure tests and applied to a first extraction of the LHC muon neutrino flux from the FASER 2024 data. We show how NN$\nu$flux can discriminate between event generators of forward hadron production; scrutinize a possible intrinsic charm component in the proton; and constrain BSM scenarios with enhanced decays of neutral hadrons into neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Interaction with external gravitational field is introduced into a nonlocal quark model using the equivalence principle. This allows to define the energy-momentum tensor in flat space and evaluate its hadronic matrix element with external pions.

      <title>evortran: a modern Fortran package for genetic algorithms with applications from LHC data fitting to LISA signal reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of flavour coupling on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the impact of flavour coupling on the predictions of low energy neutrino parameters from $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis (SO10INLEP). The right-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical and successful leptogenesis relies on generating the asymmetry from next-to-lightest RH neutrino decays ($N_2$-leptogenesis) and circumventing the lightest RH neutrino washout. These two conditions yield distinctive predictions such as a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m_1 \gtrsim 1\,{\rm meV}$. We first review the status of SO10INLEP, noticing how cosmological observations are now testing a particular neutrino mass window, $m_1 \simeq (10$--$30)\,{\rm meV}$, where only the first octant is allowed and a large range of values for the Dirac phase is excluded. Including flavour coupling, we find that the lower bound relaxes to $m_1 \gtrsim 0.65\,{\rm meV}$. Moreover, new muon-dominated solutions appear slightly relaxing the upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle. We also study the impact on strong thermal SO10INLEP (ST-SO10INLEP) scenario where, in addition to successful leptogenesis, one can washout a large pre-existing asymmetry. Contrarily to naive expectations, for which flavour coupling could jeopardise the scenario, allowing a large pre-existing asymmetry to survive unconditionally, we show, and explain analytically, that ST-SO10INLEP is still viable within almost the same allowed region of parameters. There is even a slight relaxation of the $m_1$ viable window from (9--30)meV to (4--40)meV for a $10^{-3}$ pre-existing asymmetry. The new results from atmospheric neutrinos, mildly favouring normal ordering and first octant, are now in nice agreement with the predictions of ST-SO10INLEP. Intriguingly, the predicted $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal is starting to be within the reach of KamLAND-Zen.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method, termed discontinuity calculus, for computing discontinuities of complex functions. This framework enables a systematic investigation of both analytic continuation and the topological structure of Riemann surfaces. We apply this calculus to analyze the analytic continuation of partial-wave amplitudes in two-body coupled-channel scattering problems and discuss their uniformization of the corresponding Riemann surfaces. This methodology offers new perspectives and tools for analyzing coupled-channel scattering problems in quantum scattering theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a global fit of Standard Model parameters and dimension-6 SMEFT Wilson coefficients that includes electroweak, Drell-Yan, Higgs-boson, top-quark, and flavour observables. Fits obtained by floating individual coefficients are also discussed. The leading-order scale dependence of the SMEFT Wilson coefficients is consistently included in the evolution from the UV scale to the electroweak scale and the low-energy scale of flavour observables. In defining the SMEFT set of active operators we consider both the $U(3)^5$ and the $U(2)^5$ flavour symmetric limits. All fits are obtained within the $\texttt{HEPfit}$ framework and are based on the most recent experimental results and state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for all the observables considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dilepton production at forward rapidities in hadronic collisions at the LHC energies is considered and the helicity density matrix elements of gauge bosons that enter the Drell--Yan angular coefficients associated with the gauge boson decay ($G = \gamma^*, Z^0, W$) are derived using the color-dipole $S$ - matrix framework. We show results for $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV for the nonvanishing helicity density matrix elements in the rapidity range of $2.0 \le y \le 4.0$ of the gauge boson. We consider different models for the proton unintegrated gluon distributions, among others a solution of the Balitsky--Kovchegov equation. We compare the associated predictions with those obtained disregarding the non-linear term in the evolution equation. In addition, the Lam--Tung relation is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Neural Networks with Tensor Weights and the Corresponding Fermionic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation. The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional. It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry II: Catalogue of all torsion-like theories including new ghost-tachyon-free cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of consistent effective field theories in the infrared demands that models be defined by their underlying gauge symmetries, rather than by an arbitrary tuning of couplings or a cherry-picking of operators which may not be stable against radiative corrections. Adhering to this principle, we systematically derive all linear, parity-conserving models that propagate a pair-antisymmetric rank-three field on a Minkowski background. Such models are relevant not only to torsion, but to many areas in high-energy physics ranging from dual graviton formulations to string theory and higher-spin theories. Following this exhaustive classification, we extract several unitary models. In the context of torsion, the results are remarkable. None of the models we obtain propagate scalar or pseudoscalar torsion, in stark contrast to the literature focus. Instead, all models propagate one or more vector torsion modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.</description>

      <title>Generation structures and Yukawa couplings in magnetized $T^{2g}/\mathbb{Z}_N$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fermion zero-mode wave functions with various chiralities in magnetized $T^{2g}$, $(g=2,3)$ torus. First, we consider the wave functions satisfying the Dirac equation and the boundary conditions on the magnetized torus. Second, we introduce the $SO(3)$ (or parity) transformations and derive the wave functions under the modular transformation. Additionally, we calculate the Yukawa couplings with consideration for the chirality. Lastly, we briefly review how to construct $T^{4}/\mathbb{Z}_N$ ($N=2,3,4,6$) and $T^6/\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ twisted orbifold. Also, we explicitly analyze the number of the wave functions in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ sectors.</description>

      <title>Neural Unfolding of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (HICs) is challenged by significant background contamination. We present a novel deep learning approach based on a U-Net architecture to time-reversely unfold CME dynamics, enabling the reconstruction of the CME signal across the entire evolution of HICs. Trained on the events simulated by a multi-phase transport model with different cases of CME settings, our model learns to recover the CME-induced charge separation based on final-state transverse momentum distributions at either the quark-gloun plasma freeze-out or hadronic freeze-out. This underscores the promise of deep learning approaches in forthcoming experimental searches for the CME and related other physics in HICs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as argued by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysing inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Glauber model is a widely used framework for describing the initial conditions in high-energy nuclear collisions. TGlauberMC is a Monte Carlo implementation of this model that enables detailed, event-by-event calculations across various collision systems. In this work, we present an updated version of TGlauberMC (3.3), which incorporates recent theoretical developments and improved parameterizations, especially relevant for small collision systems. We focus on the oxygen--oxygen (OO), neon--Neon (NeNe), and proton-oxygen (pO) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in July 2025, where precise modeling of nuclear geometry and fluctuations is essential. The updated version includes revised nuclear density profiles and an enhanced treatment of nucleon substructure. We calculate geometrical cross sections for all relevant collision systems and explore initial-state observables, providing predictions for particle production trends at $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}$=5.36 TeV. In particular, we present a prediction for the centrality dependence of mid-rapidity multiplicity in OO and NeNe collisions. The updated code is publicly available to support the heavy-ion community with a robust and flexible tool for studying strongly interacting matter in small and intermediate-sized nuclear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (hereafter referred to as GP300) is a pioneering prototype array of the GRAND experiment. It consists of 300 radio antennas and will cover an area of 200 km$^2$ in a radio-quiet region of western China. Serving as a test bench for the GRAND experiment, GRANDProto300 aims to achieve autonomous radio detection and reconstruction of highly inclined air showers. It is designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range of $10^{16.5}$-$10^{18}$ eV at a rate comparable to that of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Over the past two years, significant improvements have been made to both the hardware and firmware of GP300. Currently, 65 antenna units have been deployed at the site by June 2025. We present the current status of detector commissioning, including updates on hardware, calibration results such as GPS timing and antenna positioning. Additionally, we discuss the solar radio bursts associated with solar flares, the galactic radio emissions detected, and preliminary cosmic ray surveys.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the issue of analytically continuing Feynman integrals from Euclidean to Minkowski signature, allowing for generic complex momenta. Although this is well-known in terms of the K\"all\'{e}n-Lehmann representation, we consider potential alternative takes on the same problem and discuss how these are not necessarily equivalent to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann integral outcome. We present our analysis for a simple enough case -- the setting sun diagram in $d=2$ with a real mass -- but already with an eye out to the more general case with complex masses which will further complicate matters.</description>

      <title>Can Orbital Decay of Accreting Binary Pulsars Probe Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal corrections to a model of real scalar dark matter (DM) interacting feebly with a SM fermion and a gauge-charged vector-like fermion mediator. We employ the Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for our calculation and go beyond previous works by including the full dependence on the relevant mass scales as opposed to using (non)relativistic approximations. In particular, we calculate the DM production rate by employing 1PI-resummed propagators constructed from the leading order term in the loop expansion of the 2PI effective action, beyond the Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) approximation. We compare our findings to commonly used approximation schemes, including solving the Boltzmann equation using momentum-independent thermal masses in decay processes and as regulators for $t$-channel divergences. We also compare with the result when employing HTL propagators and their tree-level limit. We find that the DM relic abundance when using thermal masses in the Boltzmann approach deviates between $-10\%$ and $+30\%$ from our calculation, where the size and sign strongly depend on the mass splitting between the DM candidate and the gauge-charged mediator. The HTL-approximated result is more accurate at small gauge couplings, only deviating by a few percent at large mass splittings, whereas it overestimates the relic density up to $25\%$ for small mass splittings. Calculations using tree-level propagators in the CTP formalism or semiclassical Boltzmann equations without scatterings underestimate the dark matter abundance and can lead to deviations of up to $-100\%$ from the 1PI-resummed result.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: The interpretation of groups of particle spins at colliders as quantum states has opened up the possibility of using colliders for quantum information. While most efforts have focused on utilizing the decays of the particles to infer their spins to reconstruct the quantum density matrix, we show that the production kinematics of the particles provides sufficient information about the spins to establish quantum tomography without using the decays. We perform a comparative study, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using this "kinematic approach" relative to the usual "decay approach." Since the kinematic approach leverages the simplicity of scattering kinematics, this approach promises to achieve the optimal statistical results for quantum tomography at colliders.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, nontrivial analytic structure of the quark propagator is discussed for $B$-meson inclusive decays. Attributed to invalidity of the standard K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehman spectral representation, complex conjugate poles alter the evaluation of decay rates, which lead to violation of quark-hadron duality. As phenomenological observables, widths in $B\to X_c\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay as well as the lifetime of the $B_d^0$ meson are discussed. In the presence of the mentioned nonanalytical contributions, the possibility for resolving the $|V_{cb}|$ puzzle is addressed. It is demonstrated that there exists a parameter region, which explains $|V_{cb}|$ and $B_d^0$-meson lifetime simultaneously within 1$\sigma$ via the complex conjugate poles from a charm quark.</description>

The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <title>Excited $\Omega$ hyperon in charmful $\Omega_b$ weak decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sextet $b$-baryon decay processes $\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega^{(*)}$,where $\Omega^*$ represents the $1P$-, $1D$- and $2S$-wave excited $\Omega$ hyperons in the spectroscopy. Using the constituent quark model, we obtain ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega)=8.8\times 10^{-4}$, which agrees with the previous studies to the order of magnitude. By identifying $\Omega(2012)$ as $\Omega(1^2P_{3/2^-})$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega(2012))=1.1\times 10^{-3}$ can be similarly significant. Additionally, $\Omega(1^2D_{5/2^+})$ and $\Omega(1^4D_{3/2^+},1^4D_{5/2^+})$ states exhibit production rates of 0.5, and (0.6, 0.8), respectively, relative to their ground-state counterpart. Notably, our findings suggest that ${\cal B}(\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+},2^4S_{3/2^+}))$ are as large as $(4.5,20)\times 10^{-4}$, making them accessible to experiments at LHCb.</description>

      <title>The trace distance between density matrices, a nifty tool in new-physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information methods have been brought to bear on high-energy physics, including the study of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in collider experiments. Quantum information observables have also been employed to constrain possible new physics effects. We improve on this point by introducing quantum information tools routinely used to compare quantum states: the trace distance and the fidelity. We find that the former outperforms other quantum information observables considered in the literature and, together with the cross section, yields the strongest bounds on possible departures from the Standard Model. The power of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with three examples of new physics searches. The first concerns the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark and yields the first bound computed by means of quantum tomography and actual experimental data. The other two examples use Monte Carlo simulations and set the projected limits on the anomalous couplings of the $\tau$ leptons at Belle and at a future collider, which is taken to be LEP3. For these new physics searches we also compare the sensitivity of the trace distance to those of other quantum information quantities like concurrence, magic, and the fidelity distance. In passing, we provide the first determinations of magic in colliders data by analyzing the top-quark pair production at the LHC and the charmonium decays. The significance is well above the $5\sigma$ level in both the cases.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequality Violation of Light Quarks in Back-to-Back Dihadron Pair Production at Lepton Colliders</title>

Abstract: Spin correlations between particles produced at colliders provide valuable insights for quantum information studies. While traditional studies of quantum information at colliders are typically limited to massive particles with perturbative decay, we propose an innovative method to explore the Bell inequality in massless quark pair systems by analyzing the azimuthal correlations in back-to-back $\pi^+\pi^-$ dihadron pair production at lepton colliders. Revisiting the Belle data, we have shown the potential to detect Bell inequality violation of light quarks by introducing an additional angular cut, achieving a significance of 2.5 $\sigma$ even in the worst-case scenario of 100% correlated systematic uncertainties in each bins. The significance substantially exceeds $5\sigma$ when considering uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. Our approach opens avenues for exploring spin quantum information in the non-perturbative aspect and leverages existing data for quantum information research.</description>

      <title>$B\to K{+}$invisible, dark matter, and $CP$ violation in hyperon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the Belle II Collaboration has reported a measurement of the $B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ rate that is higher than the standard-model expectation. Since the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$ decaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting as the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing interactions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon and kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in the hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds, after taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from dark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect. We demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of this new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is potentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>Large CP Asymmetries from Final-State Interactions in Charmful Baryonic Decays of $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the direct CP asymmetries in the decays of $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$, emphasizing the critical role of final-state interactions (FSIs). In these channels, the small energy release and annihilation topology suppress short-distance contributions while enhancing long-distance effects. By separating the decay amplitudes into S and P waves, we show that the P-wave component, carrying only a single weak phase, contributes negligibly to CP asymmetries. In contrast, the S-wave amplitude, strongly modified by FSIs, acquires a substantial strong phase that enables interference among multiple weak phases, producing large CP-violating effects. Numerically, we find sizable asymmetries of $a_{CP}^{\text{dir}} = 0.88 \pm 0.05 \pm 0.10$ for $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ and $a_{CP}^{\text{dir}} = -0.106 \pm 0.019 \pm 0.010$ for $B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$, where the first and second uncertainties stem from the poorly known hadron couplings and the omission of the $B^0 \to K^+ K^- \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ rescattering process. For practical feasibility, we restrict our analysis to intermediate states involving pseudoscalar mesons, which yield tractable loop integrals. Excited intermediate states, such as $D^{(*)} \overline{D}^{(*)}$, are omitted because their inclusion would require handling non-renormalizable interactions, introducing substantial ambiguity. These results, combined with the relatively large branching fractions, make these modes prime targets for experimental searches at LHCb and Belle II, potentially offering new insights into strong dynamics and nonperturbative QCD in heavy-hadron decays.</description>

Abstract: Spin correlation observables of particles produced at colliders generally depend on the coordinate basis. While spin correlations and their associated basis dependence have been studied in top-quark pair production, the basis dependence of spin correlations of a $W^\pm$ pair has not been studied. In this work, we focus on the azimuthal-angle correlation in the decay of a $W^\pm$ pair, which encodes spin information in the direction transverse to the rotational axis. We quantitatively describe the basis dependence of the relative azimuthal angle. We further present the optimal coordinate direction to define the azimuthal angle between the decay products of $W^\pm$ bosons to achieve the maximal spin correlation based on symmetry considerations. The results can be used to optimize the measurement of the CP-even and CP-odd interactions, and have applications to quantum information observables in the vector boson pair system.</description>

      <title>Investigating hybrid mesons with $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ exotic quantum numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid mesons occupy a unique position in the hadronic spectrum, offering a valuable insight into the non-perturbative nature of the glue field. Hybrid states with exotic $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers, such as the $1^{-+}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$, cannot mix with conventional $q\bar{q}$ mesons, making them critical for establishing the full spectrum of hybrid mesons. In this work, we investigate the masses and the strong decays of $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons, which could be regarded as the first orbitally excited states of the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ mesons. We develop a constituent gluon model and apply it to study the mass spectra and decay modes of these exotic states. Our results suggest that experiment may searched for these $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons in the mass region between 2.0 GeV and 2.4 GeV. Additionally, we identify some key decay channels which should be targeted in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Model-independent unbinned analysis of $B \to K^*(\to K^+\pi^-)\mu^+\mu^-$: zeroes, bounds, Wilson coefficients and symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model-independent method to study the four-body decay $B\to K^*(\to K^+\pi^-)\mu^+\mu^-$, based on extracting continuous observables with a moments approach. The method allows the observables to be determined unbinned in both the dilepton and $K^+\pi^-$ invariant masses on which the decay dynamics depend. This will allow the method to shed new light on how the observables depend on the P- and S-wave contributions to the $K^+\pi^-$ system. This approach contrasts with the state-of-the-art analyses, which bin in dilepton and $K^+\pi^-$ mass, or use a model for the dependence of the underlying decay amplitudes on these masses. The method does not require making a statistical fit, and so avoids problems of biases and poor uncertainty estimation when dealing with small samples or a large number of fit parameters. We provide the Standard Model predictions for the unbinned optimised observables, derive new geometrical bounds on their values and study the robustness of these bounds in the presence of a scalar new physics contribution. We explore the zero-crossing points of $P_2$ and $P_{4,5}^\prime$ observables as a function of a new physics contribution to the dominant vector Wilson coefficient, $C_9^{\rm NP}$. We also discuss the conditions that can be used to test the theoretical model of the amplitudes needed for an experimental amplitude analysis. Finally, as an illustration, we show how the proposed method might be used to extract the zero-crossing points, make a comparison with the bounds and test a non-trivial relation between the observable values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction of three pions and a photon, $F_{3\pi}$ is predicted by the axial anomaly in terms of the pion decay constant, a relation that is frequently used to constrain low-energy radiative processes involving pions, but only tested experimentally at the $10\%$ level. Here, we present a new avenue to test this prediction, via a fit of a dispersive description of the $\gamma^*\to3\pi$ amplitude to data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$. From the global fit to SND, CMD-2, and BaBar data we obtain $F_{3\pi}=33.1(1.7)\,\text{GeV}^{-3}$, in agreement with the chiral prediction at the level of $5\%$. We also consider dispersive fits to the recent data by Belle II, in which case we observe tensions with the dispersive constraints, the width parameters of $\omega$ and $\phi$, and the chiral anomaly.</description>

Abstract: We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen 21 cm Constraints on the Photon's Spin Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental but untested possibility that the photon is a continuous spin particle (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. When $\rho\neq 0$, the familiar polarization modes of the photon transform non-trivially under Lorentz boosts, leading to deviations from familiar QED. Surprisingly, these deviations are strongest at low energy, but smoothly vanish in the $\rho\rightarrow 0$ limit. In this letter, we compute corrections to the hydrogen 21cm transition rate, which is expected to be particularly sensitive given the small hyperfine energy splitting $\omega$. We find deviations from QED $\propto \rho^2 \alpha^2/\omega^2$ at leading order, suggesting experimental constraints $\rho\lesssim 1$ meV. Building on this work, we expect that a range of other atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems could be used to provide even more stringent tests of $\rho$ in electromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks made of light quarks and their admixture to baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our studies of multiquark hadrons. The anti-symmetrization of their wavefunctions required by Fermi statistics is nontivial, as it mixes orbital, color, spin and flavor structures. In our previous papers we developed a method to find them based on the representations of the permutation group, and derived the explicit wave functions for baryons excited to the first and second shells $(L=1,2)$, tetraquarks $qq\bar q\bar q$ and hexaquarks ($6q$). Now we apply it
  to light pentaquarks ($qqqq\bar q$), in the S- and P-shells ($L=0,1$). Using Jacobi coordinates, one can use the hyperdistance approximation in
  12-dimensional space. We further address the issue of ``unquenching" of baryons, by considering their mixing with pentaquarks, via two channels, through the addition of $\sigma$-like or $\pi$-like $\bar q q$ pairs. This mixing is central for understanding of the observed flavor asymmetry of the antiquark sea, the amount of orbital motion issue as well as other nucleon properties.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of recent $\Xi$-nuclear bound state signals</title>

Abstract: J-PARC E05 reported recently a hint of a $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ nuclear state in the ${^{12}}{\rm C}(K^-,K^+){^{12}_{\Xi}}{\rm Be}$ spectrum, bound by $B_{\Xi^-}=8.9\pm 1.4 {^{+3.8}_{-3.1}}$ MeV. Using a density-dependent $\Xi$-nuclear optical potential $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ we explore to what extent a $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment of this nuclear state is compatible with $\Xi^-_{1s}$ and $\Xi^-_{1p}$ nuclear-state interpretations of $\Xi^-$ capture events in light emulsion-nuclei experiments. We find that the only acceptable $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment at present, barring an abnormally strong repulsive $\rho^2$ component of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$, is that for the $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ signal. This finding supports reassigning $\Xi^-$ capture events in $^{14}$N, originally assigned as $\Xi^-_{1s}-{^{14}{\rm N}}$ nuclear states, to $\Xi^0_{1p}-{^{14}{\rm C}}$ nuclear states. The depth of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$ is then $-V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho_0)\sim 21$ MeV.</description>
