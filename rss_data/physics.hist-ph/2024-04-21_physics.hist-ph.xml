      <title>Finite frequentism explains quantum probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is further a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the total quantum state expressed in terms of the decoherence basis, as defined by the history space. It is a form of finite and actual frequentism (as opposed to hypothetical frequentism), insofar as all the microstates exist, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation, and some versions of pilot-wave theory.</description>

      <title>What is a reference frame in General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, reference frames must be distinguished from coordinates. The former represent physical systems interacting with the gravitational system, aside from possible approximations, while the latter are mathematical artefacts. We propose a novel three-fold distinction between Idealised Reference Frames, Dynamical Reference Frames and Real Reference Frames. In doing so, the paper not only clarifies the physical significance of reference frames, but also sheds light on the similarities between idealised reference frames and coordinates. It also analyses the salience of reference frames to define local Dirac observables and to propose a physical interpretation to diffeomorphism gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>The birth of StatPhys: The 1949 Florence conference at the juncture of post-WWII reconstruction of national and international physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spring 1949 about 70 physicists from eight countries met in Florence to discuss recent trends in statistical mechanics. This scientific gathering, co-organized by the Commission on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the Italian Physical Society (SIF), initiated a tradition of IUPAP-sponsored international conferences on statistical mechanics that lasts to this day. In 1977, when this conference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the Florence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This paper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference, situating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in Italian physics and of the revitalization of the international science organization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we illustrate how the event's success hinged on the aligned objectives of its organizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and organizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a critical phase of IUPAP's history, when the Union was resurging on the international stage post-interwar period inactivity. Nationally, the conference served as a cornerstone in SIF's strategy to re-establish Italian physics' international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization of physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its flagship journal, \textit{Il Nuovo Cimento}. This analysis not only sheds light on the conference's impact but also informs recent discussions in the history of science about the multiple roles of international scientific conferences.</description>
