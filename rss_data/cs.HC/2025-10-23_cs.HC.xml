      <title>Beyond One-Way Influence: Bidirectional Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Human-LLM Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50 controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot. Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting. Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.</description>

      <title>"Learning Together": AI-Mediated Support for Parental Involvement in Everyday Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Family learning takes place in everyday routines where children and caregivers read, practice, and develop new skills together. Although AI is increasingly present in learning environments, most systems remain child-centered and overlook the collaborative, distributed nature of family education. This paper investigates how AI can mediate family collaboration by addressing tensions of coordination, uneven workloads, and parental mediation. From a formative study with families using AI in daily learning, we identified challenges in responsibility sharing and recognition of contributions. Building on these insights, we designed FamLearn, an LLM-powered prototype that distributes tasks, visualizes contributions, and provides individualized support. A one-week field study with 11 families shows how this prototype can ease caregiving burdens, foster recognition, and enrich shared learning experiences. Our findings suggest that LLMs can move beyond the role of tutor to act as family mediators - balancing responsibilities, scaffolding intergenerational participation, and strengthening the relational fabric of family learning.</description>

      <title>Designing Intent Communication for Agent-Human Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous agents, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants, become increasingly present in everyday life, safe and effective collaboration depends on human understanding of agents' intentions. Current intent communication approaches are often rigid, agent-specific, and narrowly scoped, limiting their adaptability across tasks, environments, and user preferences. A key gap remains: existing models of what to communicate are rarely linked to systematic choices of how and when to communicate, preventing the development of generalizable, multi-modal strategies. In this paper, we introduce a multidimensional design space for intent communication structured along three dimensions: Transparency (what is communicated), Abstraction (when), and Modality (how). We apply this design space to three distinct human-agent collaboration scenarios: (a) bystander interaction, (b) cooperative tasks, and (c) shared control, demonstrating its capacity to generate adaptable, scalable, and cross-domain communication strategies. By bridging the gap between intent content and communication implementation, our design space provides a foundation for designing safer, more intuitive, and more transferable agent-human interactions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Feature Ordering in Radar Charts for Multi-Profile Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness'' across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial (exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity, practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.

      <title>Empathic Prompting: Non-Verbal Context Integration for Multimodal LLM Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance, and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.</description>

      <title>Prompt Decorators: A Declarative and Composable Syntax for Reasoning, Formatting, and Control in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative, composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families (Cognitive &amp; Generative and Expressive &amp; Systemic), each further decomposed into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Risks of Industry Influence in Tech Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging information technologies like social media, search engines, and AI can have a broad impact on public health, political institutions, social dynamics, and the natural world. It is critical to develop a scientific understanding of these impacts to inform evidence-based technology policy that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Unlike most other global-scale scientific challenges, however, the data necessary for scientific progress are generated and controlled by the same industry that might be subject to evidence-based regulation. Moreover, technology companies historically have been, and continue to be, a major source of funding for this field. These asymmetries in information and funding raise significant concerns about the potential for undue industry influence on the scientific record. In this Perspective, we explore how technology companies can influence our scientific understanding of their products. We argue that science faces unique challenges in the context of technology research that will require strengthening existing safeguards and constructing wholly new ones.</description>

      <title>Designing a Secure and Resilient Distributed Smartphone Participant Data Collection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world health studies require continuous and secure data collection from mobile and wearable devices. We introduce MotionPI, a smartphone-based system designed to collect behavioral and health data through sensors and surveys with minimal interaction from participants. The system integrates passive data collection (such as GPS and wristband motion data) with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) surveys, which can be triggered randomly or based on physical activity. MotionPI is designed to work under real-life constraints, including limited battery life, weak or intermittent cellular connection, and minimal user supervision. It stores data both locally and on a secure cloud server, with encrypted transmission and storage. It integrates through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) into wristband devices that store raw data and communicate motion summaries and trigger events. MotionPI demonstrates a practical solution for secure and scalable mobile data collection in cyber-physical health studies.</description>

      <title>Towards AI Agents for Course Instruction in Higher Education: Early Experiences from the Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration. We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.</description>

      <title>From Generation to Attribution: Music AI Agent Architectures for the Post-Streaming Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive ecosystem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD strategies for crowd rendering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine whether measured cognitive processes predict cyber-attack behavior. We analyzed data that included psychometric scale responses and labeled attack behaviors from cybersecurity professionals who conducted red-team operations against a simulated enterprise network. We employed multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression with technique counts nested within participants to test whether cognitive processes predicted technique-specific usage. The scales significantly predicted technique use, but effects varied by technique rather than operating uniformly. Neither expertise level nor experimental treatment condition significantly predicted technique patterns, indicating that cognitive processes may be stronger drivers of technique selection than training or experience. These findings demonstrate that individual cognitive differences shape cyber-attack behavior and support the development of psychology-informed defense strategies.</description>

      <title>User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records, contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g., leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further, we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users' perceived privacy and utility.</description>

      <title>FieldGen: From Teleoperated Pre-Manipulation Trajectories to Field-Guided Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning. Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Biometrics for Automatic Detection of User Familiarity in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection, achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation, where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.</description>

      <title>Learning To Defer To A Population With Limited Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main text, we provide our source code and training configurations at https://github.com/nil123532/learning-to-defer-to-a-population-with-limited-demonstrations.</description>

      <title>S-DAT: A Multilingual, GenAI-Driven Framework for Automated Divergent Thinking Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces S-DAT (Synthetic-Divergent Association Task), a scalable, multilingual framework for automated assessment of divergent thinking (DT) -a core component of human creativity. Traditional creativity assessments are often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human ratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In contrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual embeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We evaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish, German, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating robust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT approaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and correct discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic flexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research, addressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful tool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in diverse populations and can be freely assessed online: https://sdat.iol.zib.de/.</description>

      <title>GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.
