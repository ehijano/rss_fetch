      <title>On a Lebesgue-like integral over the Levi-Civita field $\mathcal{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Levi-Civita field $\mathcal{R}$ is the smallest non-Archimedean ordered field extension of the real numbers that is real closed and Cauchy complete in the topology induced by the order. In this paper we develop a new theory of integration over $\mathcal{R}$ that generalizes previous work done in the subject while circumventing the fact that not every bounded subset of $\mathcal{R}$ admits either an infimum or a supremum. We define a new family of measurable functions and a new integral over measurable subsets of $\mathcal{R}$ that satisfies some very important results analogous to those of the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals for real-valued functions. In particular, we show that the family of measurable functions forms an algebra that is closed under taking absolute values, that the integral is linear, countably additive and monotone, that the integral of a non-negative function $f:A\to\mathcal{R}$ is zero if and only if $f=0$ almost everywhere in $A$ and that the analogous versions for the uniform convergence theorem and the fundamental theorem of calculus hold true.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of Hausdorff-type operators with two-variable kernels on Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general concept of a Hausdorff-type operator that absorbs all types of operators bearing the name `` Hausdorff operator'' and many others is considered. The characteristic features of this concept are the consideration of kernels depending on an external variable and the action between two arbitrary different sets.
  Generalizations and analogs of classical results on $L^p$ boundedness of various type of Hausdorff operators are proved for the case of such operators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a conjugation (involution) $C$ on a Hilbert space, $C$-self-adjoint contractive extensions of a non-densely defined $C$-symmetric contraction are studied and
  parameterizations of all such extensions are obtained. As an application, a proof of an announced result of Glazman \cite{Glazman1} on the existence of maximal dissipative $C$-self-adjoint extensions of a densely defined $C$-symmetric dissipative operator is given.</description>

      <title>Surjective and closed range differentiation operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify Fock-type spaces $\mathcal{F}_{(m,p)}$ on which the differentiation operator $D$ has closed range. We prove that $D$ has closed range only if it is surjective, and this happens if and only if
  $m=1$. Moreover, since the operator is unbounded on the classical Fock spaces, we consider the modified or the weighted composition--differentiation operator, $D_{(u,\psi,n)} f= u\cdot\big( f^{(n)}\circ \psi\big)$, on these spaces and describe conditions under which the operator admits closed range, surjective, and order bounded structures.</description>

      <title>Almost uniform convergence for noncommutative Vilenkin-Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study almost uniform convergence for noncommutative Vilenkin-Fourier series. Precisely, we establish several noncommutative (asymmetric) maximal inequalities for the Ces\`{a}ro means of the noncommutative Vilenkin-Fourier series, which in turn give the corresponding almost uniform convergence. The primary strategy in our proof is to explore a noncommutative generalization of Sunouchi square function operator, and the very recent advance of the noncommutative Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund decomposition.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski problem for $\alpha$-concave functions via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of the Euclidean surface area measure and the spherical surface area measure of $\alpha$-concave functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $-\frac{1}{n}&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, are introduced via a first variation of the total mass functional with respect to the $\alpha$-sum operation. Subsequently, these notions are extended to those for $\alpha$-concave measures. We then study the Minkowski problem associated with the Euclidean surface area measures of $\alpha$-concave measures via optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative construction of families of biunitary matrices and application to subfactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a construction that, given a pair (u,v) of complex Hadamard matrices of the same order, generates infinitely many biunitary matrices of varying (and distinct) orders. As a key application, this framework yields nested sequences of vertex model subfactors that are not a tower of downward basic construction. Notably, the construction is noncommutative: interchanging the matrices (i.e., considering (v,u) instead of (u,v)) can lead to non-isomorphic subfactors. Focusing on the Hadamard equivalence class of the Fourier matrix, we provide a full characterization of the resulting vertex model subfactors, along with explicit computations of their relative commutants. Along the way, we conduct a detailed study of certain naturally arising inner and outer automorphisms that play a key role in the structure of these subfactors.</description>

      <title>Annihilating and breaking Lorentz cone entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear maps between finite-dimensional ordered vector spaces with orders induced by proper cones $C_A$ and $C_B$ are called entanglement breaking if their partial application sends the maximal tensor product $K\otimes_{\max} C_A$ into the minimal tensor product $K\otimes_{\min} C_B$ for any proper cone $K$. We study the larger class of Lorentz-entanglement breaking maps where $K$ is restricted to be a Lorentz cone of any dimension, i.e., any cone over a Euclidean ball. This class of maps appeared recently in the study of asymptotic entanglement annihilation and it is dual to the linear maps factoring through Lorentz cones. Our main results establish connections between these classes of maps and operator ideals studied in the theory of Banach spaces. For operators $u:X\rightarrow Y$ between finite-dimensional normed spaces $X$ and $Y$ we consider so-called central maps which are positive with respect to the cones $C_A=C_X$ and $C_B=C_Y$. We show how to characterize when such a map factors through a Lorentz cone and when it is Lorentz-entanglement breaking by using the Hilbert-space factorization norm $\gamma_2$ and its dual $\gamma^*_2$. We also study the class of Lorentz-entanglement annihilating maps whose local application sends the Lorentzian tensor product $C_A\otimes_{L} C_A$ into the minimal tensor product $C_B\otimes_{\min} C_B$. When $C_A$ is a cone over a finite-dimensional normed space and $C_B$ is a Lorentz cone itself, the central maps of this kind can be characterized by the $2$-summing norm $\pi_2$. Finally, we prove interesting connections between these classes of maps for general cones, and we identify examples with particular properties, e.g., cones with an analogue of the $2$-summing property.</description>

In the class of power weights, we get a complete picture of when the non-fractional Hardy inequality holds, for any dimension $d$ of the lattice $\Z^d$ and exponent $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

      <title>Extending Mercer's expansion to indefinite and asymmetric kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercer's expansion and Mercer's theorem are cornerstone results in kernel theory. While the classical Mercer's theorem only considers continuous symmetric positive definite kernels, analogous expansions are effective in practice for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. In this paper we extend Mercer's expansion to continuous kernels, providing a rigorous theoretical underpinning for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. We begin by demonstrating that Mercer's expansion may not be pointwise convergent for continuous indefinite kernels, before proving that the expansion of continuous kernels with bounded variation uniformly in each variable separably converges pointwise almost everywhere, almost uniformly, and unconditionally almost everywhere. We also describe an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels and give new decay bounds on its terms.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: a unified approach to Fourier dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>
