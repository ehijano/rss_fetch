      <title>Non-Perturbative Solutions to the Vlasov-Boltzmann Equation for Weakly Ionized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron energy distribution function (EEDF) in low-temperature plasmas exhibits features not fully captured by classical collisional models, particularly across the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic regimes. This work attributes these phenomena to a dynamically broken scale invariance within the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation. By applying renormalization group (RG) techniques directly to the kinetic operator, we derive non-perturbative EEDF solutions valid across a range of collisionality. The formalism yields analytic scaling relations for electron heating and predicts the emergence of distinct EEDF forms - bimodal in the kinetic limit and generalized exponential in the hydrodynamic limit - separated by a critical pressure. It is shown that the stable RG fixed point governing the system's long-time behavior corresponds to a state of minimum entropy production, establishing a thermodynamic basis for plasma self-organization. The theory provides a quantitative explanation for the experimentally observed universal data collapse of rescaled EEDFs and resolves standing issues like Godyak's EEDF metamorphosis.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations, Morphological Stability, and Asymptotic Freedom of Plasma-Surface Deposition Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG) analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles. The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales, a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area, $\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time ($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c = 1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film synthesis.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Role of Secondary Electron Emission in Direct Current Magnetron Sputtering using Explicit Energy-Conserving Particle-in-Cell Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) in a 2D cylindrically symmetric geometry. The particle-in-cell model assumes an electrostatic approximation and includes the Monte Carlo collision (MCC) method to model collisions between electrons and the neutral gas. A newly-implemented explicit energy-conserving PIC algorithm (EC-PIC) is also exercised by the model and results are compared with the standard momentum conserving PIC (MC-PIC) method. We use these simulation tools to examine how changes in secondary electron yield (SEY) and the external circuit impact the steady-state current, voltage, and plasma density of dcMS discharges. We show that in general, higher SEY and lower external resistance values lead to larger currents, smaller voltages, and larger plasma densities. We demonstrate that EC-PIC is superior to MC-PIC as the plasma current and density increase due to the improved numerical stability provided by EC-PIC.</description>

      <title>Counter-Streaming Beams in Collisionless Pair Plasma Instability Systems I: Evolution and Parameterization of the Weibel Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\gamma$-ray bursts and supernova explosion-driven shocks in collisionless plasmas, involve various plasma kinetic instabilities, such as the Weibel instability. In this paper, we explore the evolution of the Weibel instability using the spectral analysis and physical field evolution of particle-in-cell simulations. Effects of varying parameters of the initial counter-streaming beams are detailed in reference to the total evolutionary timeline of the instability. Generation of a secondary instability and excitation of electromagnetic waves primary decay have been observed. We also discuss the filament mergers during the instability decay.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic Shapiro steps in depinning dynamics of a 2D solid dusty plasma modulated by 1D nonlinear deformed periodic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional solid dusty plasma, which is modulated by one-dimensional nonlinear deformed periodic substrates, and also driven by the combination of the DC and AC forces. As the DC driving force increases gradually, pronounced subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are discovered under the combined modulation of the deformed substrate and the external AC drive. These observed subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are attributed to the dynamic mode locking. The data analysis results indicate that the nonlinear deformed substrate strongly influences these subharmonic Shapiro steps, which can be accurately diagnosed using the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles. Furthermore, the diagnostic of the kinetic temperature clearly indicates the difference between harmonic and subharmonic Shapiro steps, i.e., the particle motion is slightly less synchronized at subharmonic Shapiro steps, caused by the unstable locations of the deformed substrate.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Cosmic-Ray Transport in High-Resolution Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of $10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\'enic, characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an extended inertial range such that the Alfv\'en scale $l_A$, where $\delta B (l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Knotted Electron Diffusion Region in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that alters the magnetic field topology and releases magnetic energy. Most numerical simulations and spacecraft observations assume a two-dimensional diffusion region, with the electron diffusion region (EDR) embedded in the same plane as the ion diffusion region (IDR) and a uniform guide field throughout. Using observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we report a non-coplanar, knotted EDR in Earth's magnetotail current sheet. The reconnection plane of the knotted EDR deviates by approximately 38{\deg} from that of the IDR, with the guide field exhibiting both a 38{\deg} directional shift and a twofold increase in amplitude. Moreover, the Hall magnetic field is bipolar in the EDR but quadrupolar in the IDR, indicating different Hall current structures at electron and ion scales. These observations highlight the importance of three-dimensional effects and illustrate the complexity of multiscale coupling between the EDR and IDR during reconnection studies.1</description>

      <title>Non-Maxwellianity of Ion Velocity Distributions in the Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) of the ion velocity distribution function (iVDF) in collisionless plasma turbulence. Using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we examine the non-Maxwellianity of 439,685 iVDFs in the Earth's magnetosheath. We find that the iVDFs' anisotropies and the high-order non-bi-Maxwellian features are widespread and can be significant. Our results show that the complexity of the iVDFs is strongly influenced by the ion plasma beta and turbulence intensity, with high-order non-LTE features emerging in the presence of large-amplitude magnetic field fluctuations. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that turbulence-driven magnetic curvature contributes to the isotropization of the iVDFs by scattering the ions, emphasizing the complex interaction between turbulence and the velocity distribution of charged particles in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Conservative projection-based data-driven model order reduction of a fluid-kinetic spectral solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations are computationally intensive due to six-dimensional phase space discretization. Many kinetic spectral solvers use the asymmetrically weighted Hermite expansion due to its conservation and fluid-kinetic coupling properties, i.e., the lower-order Hermite moments capture and describe the macroscopic fluid dynamics and higher-order Hermite moments describe the microscopic kinetic dynamics. We leverage this structure by developing a parametric data-driven reduced-order model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition, which projects the higher-order kinetic moments while retaining the fluid moments intact. This approach can also be understood as learning a nonlocal closure via a reduced modal decomposition. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the method ensures local and global mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The numerical results show that the proposed method effectively replicates the high-dimensional spectral simulations at a fraction of the computational cost and memory, as validated on the weak Landau damping and two-stream instability benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Spacecraft Analysis of Type III Radio Burst Electron Beam Deceleration and electron deceleration model in the inhomegeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</description>

      <title>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</description>
