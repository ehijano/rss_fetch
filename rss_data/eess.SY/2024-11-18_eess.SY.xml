      <title>Space-Air-Ground Integrated MEC-Assisted Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems: An Online Decentralized Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing and edge/fog computing are playing a pivotal role in driving the transformation of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) towards greater intelligence and automation by providing high-quality computation offloading services to Internet of Things devices (IoTDs). Recently, space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) is emerging as a promising architecture combining edge computing and cloud computing, which has the potential to be integrated with ICPS to accelerate the realization of the above vision. In this work, we first present an SAGIMEC-assisted ICPS architecture that incorporates edge computing and cloud computing through seamless connectivity supported by satellite networks to achieve determinism in connectivity, networked computing, and intelligent networked control. Then, we formulate a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of IoTDs. This problem considers both the dynamics and uncertainties of the system environment, as well as the limited resources and energy of UAVs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to solve the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fuzzy Set Theory with Pandora Temporal Fault Trees for Dynamic Failure Analysis of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pandora temporal fault tree, as one notable extension of the fault tree, introduces temporal gates and temporal laws. Pandora Temporal Fault Tree(TFT) enhances the capability of fault trees and enables the modeling of system failure behavior that depends on sequences. The calculation of system failure probability in Pandora TFT relies on precise probabilistic information on component failures. However, obtaining such precise failure data can often be challenging. The data may be uncertain as historical records are used to derive failure data for system components. To mitigate this uncertainty, in this study, we proposed a method that integrates fuzzy set theory with Pandora TFT. This integration aims to enable dynamic analysis of complex systems, even in cases where quantitative failure data of components is unreliable or imprecise. The proposed work introduces the development of Fuzzy AND, Fuzzy OR, Fuzzy PAND, and Fuzzy POR logic gates for Pandora TFT. We also introduce a fuzzy importance measure for criticality analysis of basic events. All events in our analysis are assumed to have exponentially distributed failures, with their failure rates represented as triangular fuzzy numbers. We illustrate the proposed method through a case study of the Aircraft Fuel Distribution System (AFDS), highlighting its practical application and effectiveness in analyzing complex systems. The results are compared with existing results from Petri net and Bayesian network techniques to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>ModelPredictiveControl.jl: advanced process control made easy in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proprietary closed-source software is still the norm in advanced process control. Transparency and reproducibility are key aspects of scientific research. Free and open-source toolkit can contribute to the development, sharing and advancement of new and efficient control approaches, and the industrial sector will certainly benefit from them. This paper presents ModelPredictiveControl.jl, an open-source software package for designing model predictive controllers in the Julia programming language. It is designed to be easy to use and modular, while providing advanced features like nonlinear control and moving horizon estimation. It relies on powerful control system and mathematical optimization frameworks to simplify the construction and testing of state estimators and predictive controllers. It also integrates with the standard plotting library to quickly visualize closed-loop data. The paper presents the main functionalities and illustrates them with two case studies in simulation. The first example is a continuously stirred tank reactor described by linear dynamics. The second one implements a nonlinear, an economic, and a successive linearization model predictive controllers for an inverted pendulum. The solving times are benchmarked against equivalent implementations in MATLAB to show the efficiency of the package.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles for Supporting Power Grid Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of autonomous unmanned vehicles for supporting power grid operations. With built-in batteries and the capability to carry additional battery energy storage, the rising number of autonomous vehicles can represent a substantial amount of capacity that is currently underutilized in the power grid. Unlike traditional electric vehicles which require drivers, the operations of autonomous vehicles can be performed without human intervention. To guide idle vehicles to support power grids autonomously, we propose a tractable optimization-based method for effectively integrating these ``mobile batteries'' into grid operations. During real-time operations, the vehicles are strategically routed to target locations to help maintain system power balance and reduce operating costs. Numerical studies have confirmed both the validity and scalability of the proposed algorithm for efficiently integrating autonomous vehicles into routine power system operations.</description>

      <title>Regulating Stability Margins in Symbiotic Control: A Low-Pass Filter Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic control synergistically integrates fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures to mitigate system uncertainties more predictably than adaptive learning alone and without requiring prior knowledge of uncertainty bounds as compared to fixed-gain control alone. Specifically, increasing the fixed-gain control parameter achieves a desired level of closed-loop system performance while the adaptive law simultaneously learns and suppresses the system uncertainties. However, stability margins can be reduced when this parameter is large and this paper aims to address this practical challenge. To this end, we propose a new fixed-gain control architecture predicated on a low-pass filter approach to regulate stability margins in the symbiotic control framework. In addition to the presented system-theoretical results focusing on the stability of the closed-loop system, we provide two illustrative numerical examples to demonstrate how the low-pass filter parameters are chosen for the stability margin regulation problem without significantly compromising the closed-loop system performance.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Strategic Sensor Deployment Approach for k-coverage in WSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a graph-based sensor deployment approach in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, in today's world, where sensors are everywhere, detecting various attributes like temperature and movement, their deteriorating lifetime is indeed a very concerning issue. In many scenarios, these sensors are placed in extremely remote areas, where maintenance becomes challenging. As a result, it is not very wise to depend on a single sensor to obtain data from a particular terrain or place. Hence, multiple sensors are deployed in these places, such that no problem arises if one or few of them fail. In this work, this problem of intelligent placement of sensors is modelled from the graph theoretic point of view. We propose a new sensor deployment approach here, which results in lesser sensor density per unit area and less number of sensors as compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Finally, the numerical results also support our claims and provide insights regarding the selection of parameters that enhance the system performance.</description>

      <title>A Secure Estimator with Gaussian Bernoulli Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of cyber-physical systems in real-world applications is challenged by safety requirements in the presence of sensor threats. Most cyber-physical systems, in particular the vulnerable multi-sensor systems, struggle to detect the attack in observation signals. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a Gaussian-Bernoulli Secure (GBS) estimator, which effectively transforms the assessment of sensor status into an optimal estimation problem concerning the system state and observation indicators. It encompasses two theoretical sub-problems: sequential state estimation with partial observations and estimation updates with disordered new observations. Within the framework of Kalman filter, we derive closed-form solutions for these two issues. However, due to their computational inefficiency, we propose the iterative approach employing proximal gradient descent to accelerate the estimation update. We conduct comprehensive experiments from three perspectives: computational efficiency, detection and estimation performance, and characterization of observation error. Our GBS estimator shows the improvements compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of Residential Electric Vehicle Charging on Distribution System Hosting Capacity -- A Case-Study in Arizona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The installation of high-capacity fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) is posing a significant risk to the distribution grid as the increased demand from widespread residential EV charging could exceed the technical limits of the distribution system. Addressing this issue is critical, given that current infrastructure upgrades to enhance EV hosting capacity are both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties associated with EV charging parameters make it challenging for power utilities to accurately assess the impact of EVs added to specific locations. To address these knowledge gaps, this study (a) introduces an algorithm to coordinate residential EV charging, and (b) proposes a comprehensive framework that evaluates all transformers within a feeder. The proposed method is applied to a real-world feeder, which includes 120 transformers of varying capacities. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively manages a substantial number of EVs without overloading any of the transformers, while also pinpointing locations that must be prioritized for future upgrades. This framework can serve as a valuable reference for utilities when conducting distribution system evaluations for supporting the growing EV penetration.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Cooperative Safety for Reinforcement Learning-based Mixed-Autonomy Platoon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is recognized that the control of mixed-autonomy platoons comprising connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) can enhance traffic flow. Among existing methods, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) appears to be a promising control strategy because it can manage complex scenarios in real time. However, current research on MARL-based mixed-autonomy platoon control suffers from several limitations. First, existing MARL approaches address safety by penalizing safety violations in the reward function, thus lacking theoretical safety guarantees due to the black-box nature of RL. Second, few studies have explored the cooperative safety of multi-CAV platoons, where CAVs can be coordinated to further enhance the system-level safety involving the safety of both CAVs and HDVs. Third, existing work tends to make an unrealistic assumption that the behavior of HDVs and CAVs is publicly known and rationale. To bridge the research gaps, we propose a safe MARL framework for mixed-autonomy platoons. Specifically, this framework (i) characterizes cooperative safety by designing a cooperative Control Barrier Function (CBF), enabling CAVs to collaboratively improve the safety of the entire platoon, (ii) provides a safety guarantee to the MARL-based controller by integrating the CBF-based safety constraints into MARL through a differentiable quadratic programming (QP) layer, and (iii) incorporates a conformal prediction module that enables each CAV to estimate the unknown behaviors of the surrounding vehicles with uncertainty qualification. Simulation results show that our proposed control strategy can effectively enhance the system-level safety through CAV cooperation of a mixed-autonomy platoon with a minimal impact on control performance.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Congestion Status Identification Using LMP Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having a better understanding of how locational marginal prices (LMPs) change helps in price forecasting and market strategy making. This paper investigates the fundamental distribution of the congestion part of LMPs in high-dimensional Euclidean space using an unsupervised approach. LMP models based on the lossless and lossy DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) are analyzed to show the overlapping subspace property of the LMP data. The congestion part of LMPs is spanned by certain row vectors of the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix, and the subspace attributes of an LMP vector uniquely are found to reflect the instantaneous congestion status of all the transmission lines. The proposed method searches for the basis vectors that span the subspaces of congestion LMP data in hierarchical ways. In the bottom-up search, the data belonging to 1-dimensional subspaces are detected, and other data are projected on the orthogonal subspaces. This procedure is repeated until all the basis vectors are found or the basis gap appears. Top-down searching is used to address the basis gap by hyperplane detection with outliers. Once all the basis vectors are detected, the congestion status can be identified. Numerical experiments based on the IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, Illinois 200-bus system, and Southwest Power Pool are conducted to show the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Models for Nonlinear Distributed Control: An Unconstrained Parametrization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of large-scale cyber-physical systems requires optimal distributed policies relying solely on limited communication with neighboring agents. However, computing stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems while optimizing complex costs remains a significant challenge. Neural Networks (NNs), known for their expressivity, can be leveraged to parametrize control policies that yield good performance. However, NNs' sensitivity to small input changes poses a risk of destabilizing the closed-loop system. Many existing approaches enforce constraints on the controllers' parameter space to guarantee closed-loop stability, leading to computationally expensive optimization procedures. To address these problems, we leverage the framework of port-Hamiltonian systems to design continuous-time distributed control policies for nonlinear systems that guarantee closed-loop stability and finite $\mathcal{L}_2$ or incremental $\mathcal{L}_2$ gains, independent of the optimzation parameters of the controllers. This eliminates the need to constrain parameters during optimization, allowing the use of standard techniques such as gradient-based methods. Additionally, we discuss discretization schemes that preserve the dissipation properties of these controllers for implementation on embedded systems. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed controllers is demonstrated through consensus control of non-holonomic mobile robots subject to collision avoidance and averaged voltage regulation with weighted power sharing in DC microgrids.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Optimal Operation of Distribution Networks using Confidence Level Based Distributionally Information Gap Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural network hybrid modeling framework for dynamics learning to promote an interpretable, computationally efficient way of dynamics learning and system identification. First, a low-level model will be trained to learn the system dynamics, which utilizes multiple simple neural networks to approximate the local dynamics generated from data-driven partitions. Then, based on the low-level model, a high-level model will be trained to abstract the low-level neural hybrid system model into a transition system that allows Computational Tree Logic Verification to promote the model's ability with human interaction and verification efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Decentralized Control Design for Discrete-Time Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a data-driven approach is developed for controller design for a class of discrete-time large-scale systems, where a large-scale system can be expressed in an equivalent data-driven form and the decentralized controllers can be parameterized by the data collected from its subsystems, i.e., system state, control input, and interconnection input. Based on the developed data-driven method and the Lyapunov approach, a data-driven semi-definite programming problem is constructed to obtain decentralized stabilizing controllers. The proposed approach has been validated on a mass-spring chain model, with the significant advantage of avoiding extensive modeling processes.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Safety Monitoring of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Neural Networks via Quadratic Constraint Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety monitoring for nonlinear dynamical systems with embedded neural network components is addressed in this paper. The interval-observer-based safety monitor is developed consisting of two auxiliary neural networks derived from the neural network components of the dynamical system. Due to the presence of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks, we use quadratic constraints on the global sector to abstract the nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. By combining a quadratic constraint approach for the activation function with Lyapunov theory, the interval observer design problem is transformed into a series of quadratic and linear programming feasibility problems to make the interval observer operate with the ability to correctly estimate the system state with estimation errors within acceptable limits. The applicability of the proposed method is verified by simulation of the lateral vehicle control system.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control of nonlinear systems with closed-loop guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Balancing Passenger Transport and Power Distribution: A Distributed Dispatch Policy for Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared autonomous electric vehicles can provide on-demand transportation for passengers while also interacting extensively with the electric distribution system. This interaction is especially beneficial after a disaster when the large battery capacity of the fleet can be used to restore critical electric loads. We develop a dispatch policy that balances the need to continue serving passengers (especially critical workers) and the ability to transfer energy across the network. The model predictive control policy tracks both passenger and energy flows and provides maximum passenger throughput if any policy can. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is difficult to solve for large-scale problems, so a distributed solution approach is developed to improve scalability, privacy, and resilience. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, is effective in achieving near-optimal solutions quickly. The dispatch policy is examined in simulation to demonstrate the ability of vehicles to balance these competing objectives with benefits to both systems. Finally, we compare several dispatch behaviors, demonstrating the importance of including operational constraints and objectives from both the transportation and electric systems in the model.</description>

      <title>ART-Rx: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controlled Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) in microfluidic channels faces significant challenges in signal detection due to the stochastic nature of molecule propagation and dynamic, noisy environments. Conventional detection methods often struggle under varying channel conditions, leading to high bit error rates (BER) and reduced communication efficiency. This paper introduces ART-Rx, a novel Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for MC that addresses these challenges. Implemented within a conceptual system-on-chip (SoC), ART-Rx employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust the detection threshold based on observed errors in real time. Comprehensive simulations using MATLAB and Smoldyn compare ART-Rx's performance against a statistically optimal detection threshold across various scenarios, including different levels of interference, concentration shift keying (CSK) levels, flow velocities, transmitter-receiver distances, diffusion coefficients, and binding rates. The results demonstrate that ART-Rx significantly outperforms conventional methods, maintaining consistently low BER and bit error probabilities (BEP) even in high-noise conditions and extreme channel environments. The system exhibits exceptional robustness to interference and shows the potential to enable higher data rates in CSK modulation. Furthermore, because ART-Rx is effectively adaptable to varying environmental conditions in microfluidic channels, it offers a computationally efficient and straightforward approach to enhance signal detection in nanoscale communication systems. This approach presents a promising control theory-based solution to improve the reliability of data transmission in practical MC systems, with potential applications in healthcare, brain-machine interfaces (BMI), and the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT).</description>

      <title>Edge Caching Optimization with PPO and Transfer Learning for Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Machine Learning-based Physical-Layer Authentication in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure secure and reliable communication in wireless systems, authenticating the identities of numerous nodes is imperative. Traditional cryptography-based authentication methods suffer from issues such as low compatibility, reliability, and high complexity. Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) is emerging as a promising complement due to its exploitation of unique properties in wireless environments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML)-based PLA has gained attention for its intelligence, adaptability, universality, and scalability compared to non-ML approaches. However, a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art ML-based PLA and its foundational aspects is lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of characteristics and technologies that can be used in the ML-based PLA. We categorize existing ML-based PLA schemes into two main types: multi-device identification and attack detection schemes. In deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes, Deep Neural Networks are employed to train models, avoiding complex processing and expert feature transformation. Deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes are further subdivided, with schemes based on Convolutional Neural Networks being extensively researched. In ML-based attack detection schemes, receivers utilize intelligent ML techniques to set detection thresholds automatically, eliminating the need for manual calculation or knowledge of channel models. ML-based attack detection schemes are categorized into three sub-types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, we summarize open-source datasets used for PLA, encompassing Radio Frequency fingerprints and channel fingerprints. Finally, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.</description>

      <title>Reaching Resilient Leader-Follower Consensus in Time-Varying Networks via Multi-Hop Relays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study resilient leader-follower consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of adversarial agents, where agents' communication is modeled by time-varying topologies. The objective is to develop distributed algorithms for the nonfaulty/normal followers to track an arbitrary reference value propagated by a set of leaders while they are in interaction with the unknown adversarial agents. Our approaches are based on the weighted mean subsequence reduced (W-MSR) algorithms with agents being capable to communicate with multi-hop neighbors. Our algorithms can handle agents possessing first-order and second-order dynamics. Moreover, we characterize necessary and sufficient graph conditions for our algorithms to succeed by the novel notion of jointly robust following graphs. Our graph condition is tighter than the sufficient conditions in the literature when agents use only one-hop communication (without relays). Using multi-hop relays, we can enhance robustness of leader-follower networks without increasing communication links and obtain further relaxed graph requirements for our algorithms to succeed. Numerical examples are given to verify the efficacy of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Parameter Degeneracy using Joint Conditional Diffusion Model for WECC Composite Load Model in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems has gained widespread attention in recent years. Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the inherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy, where different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output, poses a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model parameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems, utility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for one fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we innovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver (JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous inputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability. Simulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively reduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation error is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This enables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories under different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor stalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating parameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter estimation framework across various scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Pricing for Multi-modal Pickup and Delivery Problems with Heterogeneous Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the pickup and delivery problem with multiple transportation modalities, and address the challenge of efficiently allocating transportation resources while price matching users with their desired delivery modes. More precisely, we consider that orders are demanded by a heterogeneous population of users with varying trade-offs between price and latency. To capture how prices affect the behavior of heterogeneous selfish users choosing between multiple delivery modes, we construct a congestion game taking place over a form of star network, where each source-sink pair is composed of parallel links connecting users with their preferred delivery method. Using the unique geometry of this network, we prove that one can set prices explicitly to induce any desired network flow, i.e, given a desired allocation strategy, we have a closed-form solution for the delivery prices. We conclude by performing a case study on a meal delivery problem with multiple courier modalities using data from real world instances.</description>

      <title>Distributed Solvers for Network Linear Equations with Scalarized Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed computing is fundamental to multi-agent systems, with solving distributed linear equations as a typical example. In this paper, we study distributed solvers for network linear equations over a network with node-to-node communication messages compressed as scalar values. Our key idea lies in a dimension compression scheme that includes a dimension-compressing vector and a data unfolding step. The compression vector applies to individual node states as an inner product to generate a real-valued message for node communication. In the unfolding step, such scalar message is then plotted along the subspace generated by the compression vector for the local computations. We first present a compressed consensus flow that relies only on such scalarized communication, and show that linear convergence can be achieved with well excited signals for the compression vector. We then employ such a compressed consensus flow as a fundamental consensus subroutine to develop distributed continuous-time and discrete-time solvers for network linear equations, and prove their linear convergence properties under scalar node communications. With scalar communications, a direct benefit would be the reduced node-to-node communication channel burden for distributed computing. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources through Local Energy Markets and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) grow, the electricity grid faces increased net load variability at the grid edge, impacting operability and reliability. Transactive energy, facilitated through local energy markets, offers a decentralized, indirect demand response solution, with model-free control techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling automated, decentralized participation. However, existing studies largely overlook community-level net load variability, focusing instead on socioeconomic metrics.
  This study addresses this gap by using DRL agents to automate end-user participation in a local energy market (ALEX), where agents act independently to minimize individual energy bills. Results reveal a strong link between bill reduction and decreased net load variability, assessed across metrics such as ramping rate, load factor, and peak demand over various time horizons. Using a no-control baseline, DRL agents are benchmarked against a near-optimal dynamic programming approach. The dynamic programming benchmark achieves reductions of 22.05 percent, 83.92 percent, and 24.09 percent in daily import, export, and peak demand, respectively, while the DRL agents show comparable or superior results with reductions of 21.93 percent, 84.46 percent, and 27.02 percent.
  This study demonstrates the effectiveness of DRL in decentralized grid management, highlighting its scalability and near-optimal performance in reducing net load variability within community-driven energy markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several data compressors have been proposed in distributed optimization frameworks of network systems to reduce communication overhead in large-scale applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Predictive Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Hybrid Zonotope Constraint Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial systems have tightly coupled energy and motion dynamics which must be accounted for by onboard planning algorithms. This work proposes a strategy for coupled motion and energy planning using model predictive control (MPC). A reduced-order linear time-invariant model of coupled energy and motion dynamics is presented. Constrained zonotopes are used to represent state and input constraints, and hybrid zonotopes are used to represent non-convex constraints tied to a map of the environment. The structures of these constraint representations are exploited within a mixed-integer quadratic program solver tailored to MPC motion planning problems. Results apply the proposed methodology to coupled motion and energy utilization planning problems for 1) a hybrid-electric vehicle that must restrict engine usage when flying over regions with noise restrictions, and 2) an electric package delivery drone that must track waysets with both position and battery state of charge requirements. By leveraging the structure-exploiting solver, the proposed mixed-integer MPC formulations can be implemented in real time.</description>

      <title>A Control Theoretical Approach to Online Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the solution of online problems with time-varying, linear equality and inequality constraints. Our approach is to design a novel online algorithm by leveraging the tools of control theory. In particular, for the case of equality constraints only, using robust control we design an online algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal trajectory, differently from the alternatives that achieve non-zero tracking error. When also inequality constraints are present, we show how to modify the proposed algorithm to account for the wind-up induced by the nonnegativity constraints on the dual variables. We report numerical results that corroborate the theoretical analysis, and show how the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms both with equality and inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Long-term Hydrothermal Bid-based Market Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating long-term hydrothermal bid-based markets considering strategic agents is a challenging task. The representation of strategic agents considering intertemporal constraints within a stochastic framework brings additional complexity to the already difficult single-period bilevel, thus, non-convex, optimal bidding problem. Thus, we propose a simulation methodology that effectively addresses these challenges for large-scale hydrothermal power systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a case study with real data from the large-scale Brazilian power system. In the case studies, we show the effects of market concentration in power systems and how contracts can be used to mitigate them. In particular, we show how market power might affect the current setting in Brazil. The developed method can strongly benefit policymakers, market monitors, and market designers as simulations can be used to understand existing power systems and experiment with alternative designs.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-based Approach Towards Traceable Behavior Specifications in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in a German legal context with two example scenarios and evaluate our results. Our evaluation shows that the explicit documentation of assumptions in the behavior specification supports both the identification of specification insufficiencies and their treatment. Therefore, this article provides requirements, terminology and an according methodology to facilitate ontology-based behavior specifications in automated driving.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Unmapped Environments for Robotic Systems with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for navigation and control in unmapped environments under input and state constraints using a composite control barrier function (CBF). We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Granularity Supervised Contrastive Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Aero-engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) predictions are critical to the safe operation of aero-engines. Currently, the RUL prediction task is mainly a regression paradigm with only mean square error as the loss function and lacks research on feature space structure, the latter of which has shown excellent performance in a large number of studies. This paper develops a multi-granularity supervised contrastive (MGSC) framework from plain intuition that samples with the same RUL label should be aligned in the feature space, and address the problems of too large minibatch size and unbalanced samples in the implementation. The RUL prediction with MGSC is implemented on using the proposed multi-phase training strategy. This paper also demonstrates a simple and scalable basic network structure and validates the proposed MGSC strategy on the CMPASS dataset using a convolutional long short-term memory network as a baseline, which effectively improves the accuracy of RUL prediction.</description>
