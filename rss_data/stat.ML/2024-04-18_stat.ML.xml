      <title>Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in surrogate modeling is the limited availability of data due to resource constraints associated with computationally expensive simulations. Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein Kernel Thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb {P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, Low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein Recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\operatorname{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <title>floZ: Evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method (floZ), based on normalizing flows, for estimating the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a k-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. It has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate the evidence from variational inference, Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples from the unnormalized posterior density.</description>

      <title>Improving the interpretability of GNN predictions through conformal-based graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving graph classification tasks. However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.</description>

      <title>Deep Dependency Networks and Advanced Inference Schemes for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework called deep dependency networks (DDNs) that combines dependency networks and deep learning architectures for multi-label classification, with a particular emphasis on image and video data. The primary advantage of dependency networks is their ease of training, in contrast to other probabilistic graphical models like Markov networks. In particular, when combined with deep learning architectures, they provide an intuitive, easy-to-use loss function for multi-label classification. A drawback of DDNs compared to Markov networks is their lack of advanced inference schemes, necessitating the use of Gibbs sampling. To address this challenge, we propose novel inference schemes based on local search and integer linear programming for computing the most likely assignment to the labels given observations. We evaluate our novel methods on three video datasets (Charades, TACoS, Wetlab) and three image datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE), comparing their performance with (a) basic neural architectures and (b) neural architectures combined with Markov networks equipped with advanced inference and learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our new DDN methods over the two competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Expected Coordinate Improvement for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is very popular for solving low-dimensional expensive optimization problems. Extending Bayesian optimization to high dimension is a meaningful but challenging task. One of the major challenges is that it is difficult to find good infill solutions as the acquisition functions are also high-dimensional. In this work, we propose the expected coordinate improvement (ECI) criterion for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. The proposed ECI criterion measures the potential improvement we can get by moving the current best solution along one coordinate. The proposed approach selects the coordinate with the highest ECI value to refine in each iteration and covers all the coordinates gradually by iterating over the coordinates. The greatest advantage of the proposed ECI-BO (expected coordinate improvement based Bayesian optimization) algorithm over the standard BO algorithm is that the infill selection problem of the proposed algorithm is always a one-dimensional problem thus can be easily solved. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better results than the standard BO algorithm and competitive results when compared with five state-of-the-art high-dimensional BOs. This work provides a simple but efficient approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards an Approximation Theory of Observable Operator Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observable operator models (OOMs) offer a powerful framework for modelling stochastic processes, surpassing the traditional hidden Markov models (HMMs) in generality and efficiency. However, using OOMs to model infinite-dimensional processes poses significant theoretical challenges. This article explores a rigorous approach to developing an approximation theory for OOMs of infinite-dimensional processes. Building upon foundational work outlined in an unpublished tutorial [Jae98], an inner product structure on the space of future distributions is rigorously established and the continuity of observable operators with respect to the associated 2-norm is proven. The original theorem proven in this thesis describes a fundamental obstacle in making an infinite-dimensional space of future distributions into a Hilbert space. The presented findings lay the groundwork for future research in approximating observable operators of infinite-dimensional processes, while a remedy to the encountered obstacle is suggested.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with Proper Scoring Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty representation and quantification are paramount in machine learning and constitute an important prerequisite for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose novel measures for the quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, which are loss functions with the meaningful property that they incentivize the learner to predict ground-truth (conditional) probabilities. We assume two common representations of (epistemic) uncertainty, namely, in terms of a credal set, i.e. a set of probability distributions, or a second-order distribution, i.e., a distribution over probability distributions. Our framework establishes a natural bridge between these representations. We provide a formal justification of our approach and introduce new measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty as concrete instantiations.</description>

      <title>A Quadrature Approach for General-Purpose Batch Bayesian Optimization via Probabilistic Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</description>

      <title>Physics-integrated generative modeling using attentive planar normalizing flow based variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-integrated generative modeling is a class of hybrid or grey-box modeling in which we augment the the data-driven model with the physics knowledge governing the data distribution. The use of physics knowledge allows the generative model to produce output in a controlled way, so that the output, by construction, complies with the physical laws. It imparts improved generalization ability to extrapolate beyond the training distribution as well as improved interpretability because the model is partly grounded in firm domain knowledge. In this work, we aim to improve the fidelity of reconstruction and robustness to noise in the physics integrated generative model. To this end, we use variational-autoencoder as a generative model. To improve the reconstruction results of the decoder, we propose to learn the latent posterior distribution of both the physics as well as the trainable data-driven components using planar normalizng flow. Normalizng flow based posterior distribution harnesses the inherent dynamical structure of the data distribution, hence the learned model gets closer to the true underlying data distribution. To improve the robustness of generative model against noise injected in the model, we propose a modification in the encoder part of the normalizing flow based VAE. We designed the encoder to incorporate scaled dot product attention based contextual information in the noisy latent vector which will mitigate the adverse effect of noise in the latent vector and make the model more robust. We empirically evaluated our models on human locomotion dataset [33] and the results validate the efficacy of our proposed models in terms of improvement in reconstruction quality as well as robustness against noise injected in the model.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Analysis of Neural Gradient Descent-Ascent: Applications to Functional Conditional Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimax optimization problems defined over infinite-dimensional function classes. In particular, we restrict the functions to the class of overparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply our general results to concrete examples including policy evaluation, nonparametric instrumental variable regression, and asset pricing.</description>

      <title>Matching the Statistical Query Lower Bound for k-sparse Parity Problems with Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-parity problem with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that SGD can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a $d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\le O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, thus matching the established $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural network with SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. Our theoretical results and findings are supported by empirical evidence, showcasing the efficiency and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models are widely applied in various fields. Stakeholders often use post-hoc feature importance methods to better understand the input features' contribution to the models' predictions. The interpretation of the importance values provided by these methods is frequently based on the relative order of the features (their ranking) rather than the importance values themselves. Since the order may be unstable, we present a framework for quantifying the uncertainty in global importance values. We propose a novel method for the post-hoc interpretation of feature importance values that is based on the framework and pairwise comparisons of the feature importance values. This method produces simultaneous confidence intervals for the features' ranks, which include the ``true'' (infinite sample) ranks with high probability, and enables the selection of the set of the top-k important features.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Cooperative Diffusion Recovery Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training energy-based models (EBMs) on high-dimensional data can be both challenging and time-consuming, and there exists a noticeable gap in sample quality between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs and diffusion models. To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, our approach significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern distribution matching algorithms for training diffusion or flow models directly prescribe the time evolution of the marginal distributions between two boundary distributions. In this work, we consider a generalized distribution matching setup, where these marginals are only implicitly described as a solution to some task-specific objective function. The problem setup, known as the Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge (GSB), appears prevalently in many scientific areas both within and without machine learning. We propose Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (GSBM), a new matching algorithm inspired by recent advances, generalizing them beyond kinetic energy minimization and to account for task-specific state costs. We show that such a generalization can be cast as solving conditional stochastic optimal control, for which efficient variational approximations can be used, and further debiased with the aid of path integral theory. Compared to prior methods for solving GSB problems, our GSBM algorithm better preserves a feasible transport map between the boundary distributions throughout training, thereby enabling stable convergence and significantly improved scalability. We empirically validate our claims on an extensive suite of experimental setups, including crowd navigation, opinion depolarization, LiDAR manifolds, and image domain transfer. Our work brings new algorithmic opportunities for training diffusion models enhanced with task-specific optimality structures.

      <description>arXiv:2002.06910v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of multidimensional data has proven to be a popular approach, with successful applications in a wide range of domains. Despite their usefulness, t-SNE projections can be hard to interpret or even misleading, which hurts the trustworthiness of the results. Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task, especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this work, we present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent, accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets. Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness was evaluated. By bringing to light information that would normally be lost after running t-SNE, we hope to support analysts in using t-SNE and making its results better understandable.</description>

      <title>VisEvol: Visual Analytics to Support Hyperparameter Search through Evolutionary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.01205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the training phase of machine learning (ML) models, it is usually necessary to configure several hyperparameters. This process is computationally intensive and requires an extensive search to infer the best hyperparameter set for the given problem. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that most ML models are complex internally, and training involves trial-and-error processes that could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, each hyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others, and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaining hyperparameters. Evolutionary optimization is a promising method to try and address those issues. According to this method, performant models are stored, while the remainder are improved through crossover and mutation processes inspired by genetic algorithms. We present VisEvol, a visual analytics tool that supports interactive exploration of hyperparameters and intervention in this evolutionary procedure. In summary, our proposed tool helps the user to generate new models through evolution and eventually explore powerful hyperparameter combinations in diverse regions of the extensive hyperparameter space. The outcome is a voting ensemble (with equal rights) that boosts the final predictive performance. The utility and applicability of VisEvol are demonstrated with two use cases and interviews with ML experts who evaluated the effectiveness of the tool.</description>

      <title>FeatureEnVi: Visual Analytics for Feature Engineering Using Stepwise Selection and Semi-Automatic Extraction Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.14539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps, from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results, with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales. FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques; furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of our system.</description>

      <title>VisRuler: Visual Analytics for Extracting Decision Rules from Bagged and Boosted Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00334v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble methods in machine learning (ML) that produce many individual decision trees. Due to the inherent ensemble characteristic of these methods, they typically outperform single decision trees or other ML models in predictive performance. However, numerous decision paths are generated for each decision tree, increasing the overall complexity of the model and hindering its use in domains that require trustworthy and explainable decisions, such as finance, social care, and health care. Thus, the interpretability of bagging and boosting algorithms, such as random forest and adaptive boosting, reduces as the number of decisions rises. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics tool that aims to assist users in extracting decisions from such ML models via a thorough visual inspection workflow that includes selecting a set of robust and diverse models (originating from different ensemble learning algorithms), choosing important features according to their global contribution, and deciding which decisions are essential for global explanation (or locally, for specific cases). The outcome is a final decision based on the class agreement of several models and the explored manual decisions exported by users. We evaluated the applicability and effectiveness of VisRuler via a use case, a usage scenario, and a user study. The evaluation revealed that most users managed to successfully use our system to explore decision rules visually, performing the proposed tasks and answering the given questions in a satisfying way.</description>

      <title>HardVis: Visual Analytics to Handle Instance Hardness Using Undersampling and Oversampling Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous advances in machine learning (ML), training with imbalanced data still poses challenges in many real-world applications. Among a series of diverse techniques to solve this problem, sampling algorithms are regarded as an efficient solution. However, the problem is more fundamental, with many works emphasizing the importance of instance hardness. This issue refers to the significance of managing unsafe or potentially noisy instances that are more likely to be misclassified and serve as the root cause of poor classification performance. This paper introduces HardVis, a visual analytics system designed to handle instance hardness mainly in imbalanced classification scenarios. Our proposed system assists users in visually comparing different distributions of data types, selecting types of instances based on local characteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, and validating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques are beneficial for the ML model. Additionally, rather than uniformly undersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sample easy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users can explore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all those parameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model's predictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is a well-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. The efficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypothetical usage scenario and a use case. Finally, we also look at how useful our system is based on feedback we received from ML experts.</description>

      <title>Boomerang: Local sampling on image manifolds using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference stage of diffusion models can be seen as running a reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equation, where samples from a Gaussian latent distribution are transformed into samples from a target distribution that usually reside on a low-dimensional manifold, e.g., an image manifold. The intermediate values between the initial latent space and the image manifold can be interpreted as noisy images, with the amount of noise determined by the forward diffusion process noise schedule. We utilize this interpretation to present Boomerang, an approach for local sampling of image manifolds. As implied by its name, Boomerang local sampling involves adding noise to an input image, moving it closer to the latent space, and then mapping it back to the image manifold through a partial reverse diffusion process. Thus, Boomerang generates images on the manifold that are ``similar,'' but nonidentical, to the original input image. We can control the proximity of the generated images to the original by adjusting the amount of noise added. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of the reverse diffusion process in Boomerang, the generated images display a certain degree of stochasticity, allowing us to obtain local samples from the manifold without encountering any duplicates. Boomerang offers the flexibility to work seamlessly with any pretrained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, without necessitating any adjustments to the reverse diffusion process. We present three applications for Boomerang. First, we provide a framework for constructing privacy-preserving datasets having controllable degrees of anonymity. Second, we show that using Boomerang for data augmentation increases generalization performance and outperforms state-of-the-art synthetic data augmentation. Lastly, we introduce a perceptual image enhancement framework, which enables resolution enhancement.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the objective is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>MetaStackVis: Visually-Assisted Performance Evaluation of Metamodels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacking (or stacked generalization) is an ensemble learning method with one main distinctiveness from the rest: even though several base models are trained on the original data set, their predictions are further used as input data for one or more metamodels arranged in at least one extra layer. Composing a stack of models can produce high-performance outcomes, but it usually involves a trial-and-error process. Therefore, our previously developed visual analytics system, StackGenVis, was mainly designed to assist users in choosing a set of top-performing and diverse models by measuring their predictive performance. However, it only employs a single logistic regression metamodel. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the performance of stacking ensembles using a novel visualization tool, called MetaStackVis. Our interactive tool helps users to visually explore different singular and pairs of metamodels according to their predictive probabilities and multiple validation metrics, as well as their ability to predict specific problematic data instances. MetaStackVis was evaluated with a usage scenario based on a medical data set and via expert interviews.</description>

      <title>The State of the Art in Enhancing Trust in Machine Learning Models with the Use of Visualizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are nowadays used in complex applications in various domains, such as medicine, bioinformatics, and other sciences. Due to their black box nature, however, it may sometimes be hard to understand and trust the results they provide. This has increased the demand for reliable visualization tools related to enhancing trust in ML models, which has become a prominent topic of research in the visualization community over the past decades. To provide an overview and present the frontiers of current research on the topic, we present a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) on enhancing trust in ML models with the use of interactive visualization. We define and describe the background of the topic, introduce a categorization for visualization techniques that aim to accomplish this goal, and discuss insights and opportunities for future research directions. Among our contributions is a categorization of trust against different facets of interactive ML, expanded and improved from previous research. Our results are investigated from different analytical perspectives: (a) providing a statistical overview, (b) summarizing key findings, (c) performing topic analyses, and (d) exploring the data sets used in the individual papers, all with the support of an interactive web-based survey browser. We intend this survey to be beneficial for visualization researchers whose interests involve making ML models more trustworthy, as well as researchers and practitioners from other disciplines in their search for effective visualization techniques suitable for solving their tasks with confidence and conveying meaning to their data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two methods to solve the American-style option pricing problem and its dual form at the same time using neural networks. Without applying nested Monte Carlo, the first method uses a series of neural networks to simultaneously compute both the lower and upper bounds of the option price, and the second one accomplishes the same goal with one global network. The avoidance of extra simulations and the use of neural networks significantly reduce the computational complexity and allow us to price Bermudan options with frequent exercise opportunities in high dimensions, as illustrated by the provided numerical experiments. As a by-product, these methods also derive a hedging strategy for the option, which can also be used as a control variate for variance reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or `easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize.
  Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system.</description>

      <title>High-probability Convergence Bounds for Nonlinear Stochastic Gradient Descent Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study high-probability convergence guarantees of learning on streaming data in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. In the proposed scenario, the model is updated in an online fashion, as new information is observed, without storing any additional data. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, we consider a general framework of nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD), providing several strong results. First, for non-convex costs and component-wise nonlinearities, we establish a convergence rate arbitrarily close to $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\frac{1}{4}}\right)$, whose exponent is independent of noise and problem parameters. Second, for strongly convex costs and a broader class of nonlinearities, we establish convergence of the last iterate to the optimum, with a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\zeta} \right)$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on problem parameters, noise and nonlinearity. As we show analytically and numerically, $\zeta$ can be used to inform the preferred choice of nonlinearity for given problem settings. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping, require bounded noise moments of order $\eta \in (1,2]$, and establish convergence rates whose exponents go to zero as $\eta \rightarrow 1$, we provide high-probability guarantees for a much broader class of nonlinearities and symmetric density noise, with convergence rates whose exponents are bounded away from zero, even when the noise has finite first moment only. Moreover, in the case of strongly convex functions, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of our general framework.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables rapid generalization to new tasks by learning knowledge from various tasks. It is intuitively assumed that as the training progresses, a model will acquire richer knowledge, leading to better generalization performance. However, our experiments reveal an unexpected result: there is negative knowledge transfer between tasks, affecting generalization performance. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for causal analysis. Our investigation uncovers the presence of spurious correlations between task-specific causal factors and labels in meta-learning. Furthermore, the confounding factors differ across different batches. We refer to these confounding factors as "Task Confounders". Based on these findings, we propose a plug-and-play Meta-learning Causal Representation Learner (MetaCRL) to eliminate task confounders. It encodes decoupled generating factors from multiple tasks and utilizes an invariant-based bi-level optimization mechanism to ensure their causality for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Effect Size Estimation for Duration Recommendation in Online Experiments: Leveraging Hierarchical Models and Objective Utility Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of the assumed effect size (AES) critically determines the duration of an experiment, and hence its accuracy and efficiency. Traditionally, experimenters determine AES based on domain knowledge. However, this method becomes impractical for online experimentation services managing numerous experiments, and a more automated approach is hence of great demand. We initiate the study of data-driven AES selection in for online experimentation services by introducing two solutions. The first employs a three-layer Gaussian Mixture Model considering the heteroskedasticity across experiments, and it seeks to estimate the true expected effect size among positive experiments. The second method, grounded in utility theory, aims to determine the optimal effect size by striking a balance between the experiment's cost and the precision of decision-making. Through comparisons with baseline methods using both simulated and real data, we showcase the superior performance of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Visualization for Trust in Machine Learning Revisited: The State of the Field in 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualization for explainable and trustworthy machine learning remains one of the most important and heavily researched fields within information visualization and visual analytics with various application domains, such as medicine, finance, and bioinformatics. After our 2020 state-of-the-art report comprising 200 techniques, we have persistently collected peer-reviewed articles describing visualization techniques, categorized them based on the previously established categorization schema consisting of 119 categories, and provided the resulting collection of 542 techniques in an online survey browser. In this survey article, we present the updated findings of new analyses of this dataset as of fall 2023 and discuss trends, insights, and eight open challenges for using visualizations in machine learning. Our results corroborate the rapidly growing trend of visualization techniques for increasing trust in machine learning models in the past three years, with visualization found to help improve popular model explainability methods and check new deep learning architectures, for instance.</description>

      <title>Private graphon estimation via sum-of-squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the first pure node-differentially-private algorithms for learning stochastic block models and for graphon estimation with polynomial running time for any constant number of blocks. The statistical utility guarantees match those of the previous best information-theoretic (exponential-time) node-private mechanisms for these problems. The algorithm is based on an exponential mechanism for a score function defined in terms of a sum-of-squares relaxation whose level depends on the number of blocks. The key ingredients of our results are (1) a characterization of the distance between the block graphons in terms of a quadratic optimization over the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, (2) a general sum-of-squares convergence result for polynomial optimization over arbitrary polytopes, and (3) a general approach to perform Lipschitz extensions of score functions as part of the sum-of-squares algorithmic paradigm.</description>
