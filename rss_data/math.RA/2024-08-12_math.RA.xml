      <title>Weak Hopf algebras arising from weak matched pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the idea of matched pairs presented by Majid in \cite{Majid} and Takeuchi in \cite{Takeuchi} for the context of weak bialgebras and weak Hopf algebras. We introduce, also inspired by partial matched pairs \cite{matchedpair}, the notion of weak matched pairs and establish conditions for a subspace of the smash product be a weak bialgebra/Hopf algebra. Further, some new examples of (co)actions of weak bialgebras over algebras and some results about integral elements are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalised Brillouin Zone for Non-Reciprocal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Floquet-Bloch transform with real quasiperiodicities fails to capture the spectral properties of non-reciprocal systems. The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of a generalised Brillouin zone by allowing the quasiperiodicities to be complex in order to rectify this. It is proved that this shift of the Brillouin zone into the complex plane accounts for the unidirectional spatial decay of the eigenmodes and leads to correct spectral convergence properties. The results in this paper clarify and prove rigorously how the spectral properties of a finite structure are associated with those of the corresponding semi-infinitely or infinitely periodic lattices and give explicit characterisations of how to extend the Hermitian theory to non-reciprocal settings. Based on our theory, we characterise the generalised Brillouin zone for both open boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions. Our results are consistent with the physical literature and give explicit generalisations to the $k$-Toeplitz matrix cases.</description>

      <title>Properties of the cone of polynomials of fixed degree that preserve nonnegative matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was detailed by Loewy and London in [Linear and Multilinear Algebra 6 (1978/79), no.~1, 83--90], the cone of polynomials that preserve the nonnegativity of matrices may play an important role in the solution to the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we start by showing the cone generated by polynomials of degree greater than or equal to $2n$ that preserve nonnegative matrices of order $n$ is non-polyhedral. Next, a question posed by Loewy in [Linear Algebra and its Applications, 676(2023), 267--276], about how negative the center term can be in a degree $2n$ polynomial is answered. We extend this to show that a polynomial that preserves nonnegative matrices of order $n$ can have it's the largest term, in absolute value, be arbitrarily negative with the remaining coefficients being one. We conclude, by exploring properties of the measure of the cone when restricted to the unit sphere and by proving some initial bounds of that volume.</description>
