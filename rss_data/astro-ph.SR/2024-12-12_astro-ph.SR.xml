      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto WD 2226$-$210, the central star of the Helix Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central star of the Helix Nebula, WD 2226$-$210 presents enigmatic hard X-ray emission and mid-IR excess. The latter has been attributed to a dusty disk or a cloud-like structure around WD 2226$-$210 formed from material of Kuiper Belt-like or comet-like objects in highly eccentric orbits. We present here a detailed analysis of multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of WD 2226$-$210, comparing these to previous Einstein and ROSAT data. The luminosity of the hard X-ray component of WD 2226$-$210 has remained basically constant in the decade from 1992 to 2002, with very subtle evidence for variability in timescales of hours. Under the assumption that the X-ray emission from WD 2226$-$210 is due to accretion of material, an accretion rate of $\dot{M}\approx10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is estimated. The origin of the material accreted by WD 2226$-$210 is uncertain, and can be attributed to the disk-like structure around it or to a sub-stellar donor companion. The accretion rate proposed for the continuous replenishment by bombardment of the mid-IR-emitting structure around WD 2226$-$210 cannot match that required by the X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Deeply Comprehensive Astrometric, Photometric, and Kinematic Studies of the Three OCSN Open Clusters with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze poorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200, and 551 with highly probable ($P \geq 50\%$) members. Fitting King's profile within RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190 $\le r_{\rm c}$ (pc) $\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\le r_{\rm cl}$ (pc) $\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between (log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones. Therefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the heliocentric distances are 332 $\pm$ 18, 529 $\pm$ 23, and 506 $\pm$ 23 (pc) for OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively. Furthermore, the collective mass ($M_{\rm C}$) in solar mass units calculated with MLR as 67 $\pm$ 8.19, 91 $\pm$ 9.54, and 353 $\pm$ 18.79. Additionally, LF determined that the mean absolute magnitudes are 9.54 $\pm$ 3.09, 8.52 $\pm$ 2.92, and 7.60 $\pm$ 2.76 for these clusters, respectively. The overall mass function reflects the slopes ($\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41 $\pm$ 0.06), ($\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.07), and ($\alpha_{OCSN244}$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis over varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that have undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter ($\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits characteristics of a non-relaxed cluster. A kinematic analysis of these open clusters was carried out, encompassing aspects of their apex position ($A_o,D_o$) using the AD diagrams. At the end, we found that the three OCSN clusters are young stellar disc members using dynamic orbit parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar wind transport model parameters using Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply nested-sampling (NS) Bayesian analysis [AshtonEA22] to a model for the transport of MHD-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support comparisons of distinct versions of the TTM. The TTMs analysed are essentially 1D steady-state presented in [BreechEA08] that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modelled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. These effects involve adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain. Bayesian analysis supports the efficient searching of a parameter space for the 'best' set of TTM parameter values. More advanced use provides the parameter's posterior distribution: its probability given the data, and the model. This can be used to understand the uncertainty in the provided 'best' values for the parameters and therefore the uncertainty in the suggested TTM solutions/predictions. By using NS, we can calculate the Bayesian evidence for each TTM and objectively determine which best fits the given observational data. Based on the analysis of the datasets and TTM employed, we recommend use of the 2D TTM with von Karman-Howarth parameters ${\alpha}\approx 0.16$ and $\beta \approx 0.10$ and parameter assumptions from existing literature. It is important to include the pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming $Z^{2\beta/\alpha}\lambda = const$ is locally conserved. This work is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models. Although more work is required to generate datasets with associated errors, which is necessary for accurate Bayesian modelling.</description>

      <title>3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full star 3D simulations of the A=23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.</description>

      <title>RatanSunPy: A robust preprocessing pipeline for RATAN-600 solar radio observations data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of observational technologies and software for processing and visualizing spectro-polarimetric microwave data obtained with the RATAN-600 radio telescope opens new opportunities for studying the physical characteristics of solar plasma at the levels of the chromosphere and corona. These levels remain some difficult to detect in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges. The development of such methods allows for more precise investigation of the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the processes occurring in these layers. The obtained data also can be utilized for diagnosing solar plasma and forecasting solar activity. However, using RATAN-600 data requires extensive data processing and familiarity with the RATAN-600. This paper introduces RatanSunPy, an open-source Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 solar complex. The package offers comprehensive data processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources, identifying them with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) active regions, and further determining parameters for local sources and active regions. By streamlining data processing workflows, RatanSunPy enables researchers to investigate the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere more efficiently, contributing to advancements in solar physics and space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Orbit determination of visual binary systems observed with CST telescope in 2010-2013</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new orbital solutions for 15 binaries, which were astrometrically measured during 2010-2013. We observe the binary systems using the FastCam ``lucky-imaging'' camera, installed at the 1.5-m Carlos S\'anchez Telescope (CST) at the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife (Spain). We present first orbital solutions for four binaries and revise orbits for other 11 systems. We apply two orbital calculation techniques, the ``three-dimensional grid search method'' and the Docobo's analytical method. In addition, we use our tool ``Binary Deblending'', which is based on deblending the entire observed multiband photometry into fundamental and photometric parameters for each stellar component based on PARSEC isochrones. This method allows us to obtain the total mass for all systems. Our findings include the identification of a binary system consisting of two M-type dwarfs (WOR 19), a binary of evolved components (twin F6IV-V stars) in BU 1292, accompanied by a newly discovered wide (10.5 arcsec) and faint companion with G=17.05 mag. Additionally, we explore the X-ray emission system STF 147 and a very young quadruple system, WDS 04573+5345. This comprehensive analysis significantly contributes to our understanding on the formation and evolution of these stellar systems.</description>

      <title>SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence based chromospheric feature extractor and classifier for SUIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>

      <title>Probing the gas that builds planets: Results from the JWST MINDS program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared observations with JWST open up a new window into the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disk (&lt;few au) where planets are built. Results from the MIRI GTO program MINDS (PI: Th. Henning, co-PI: I. Kamp) are presented for several disks around T Tauri and lower-mass stars. A large diversity in spectra is found. Some disks are very rich in H2O lines whereas other disks show prominent CO2. The spectra of disks around very low-mass stars (&lt;0.3 MSun, late-M type stars like Trappist-1) are dominated by C2H2 and other hydrocarbon features including those of benzene, suggesting volatile C/O&gt;1. Together these data point to a rich chemistry in the inner regions that is linked to the physical structure of these disks (e.g., dust traps) and that may be affected by processes such as radial drift of icy pebbles from the outer to the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Can Alfv\'enic Fluctuations Affect the Correlation and Complexity of Magnetic Fields in Magnetic Ejecta? A Case Study Based on Multi-Spacecraft Measurements at 1~au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) can affect the structure of magnetic ejecta (MEs) within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We study an ICME observed on 2001 December 29 at 1 au by ACE and Wind, at a total angular separation of $\sim$0.8$^\circ$ ($\sim0.014$~au). We focus on the correlation and complexity of its magnetic structure measured between two spacecraft in association with large-amplitude AFs. The Alfv\'enicity of the ME is investigated in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations. We find that as for the event of interest, large-amplitude AFs occur in the rear region of the ME at both Wind and ACE with a duration of about six hours. We compare the correlation of the magnetic field strength and vector components measured between Wind and ACE, and investigate complexity in terms of the magnetic hodograms. The region showing AFs is found to be associated with a decreased correlation of the magnetic field components and an increased complexity of the ME magnetic configuration detected at ACE and Wind, which may be due to the fact that the two spacecraft crossing the same ME along different trajectories likely sampled AFs in different oscillation phases. Combining multi-point in-situ measurements and remote-sensing observations of the ICME source region, we further discuss different potential sources of the AFs.</description>

Abstract: M dwarfs have become increasingly important in the detection of exoplanets and the study of Earth-sized planets and their habitability. However, 20-30% of M dwarfs have companions that can impact the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We use high-resolution imaging and Gaia astrometry to detect stellar companions around M dwarf exoplanet hosts discovered by TESS and determine the projected separation and estimated stellar masses for each system. We find 47 companions around 216 M dwarfs and a multiplicity rate of $19.4\pm2.7$% that is consistent with field M dwarfs. The binary projected separation distribution is shifted to larger separations, confirming the lack of close binaries hosting transiting exoplanets seen in previous studies. We correct the radii of planets with nearby companions and examine the properties of planets in M dwarf multi-star systems. We also note three multi-planet systems that occur in close binaries ($\lesssim 50$ au) where planet formation is expected to be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Potential Interior Structures and Habitability of Super-Earth Exoplanets LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b and TOI-1468 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08476</link>

Abstract: We analyze four super-Earth exoplanets, LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c, which orbit M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone. Their relative proximity, within 40 parsecs, makes them prime candidates for follow-up observations and atmospheric and habitability studies. This paper aims to assess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal heating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior structure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's interior model. A constant quality factor model is used to calculate the range of tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked planets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and habitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are likely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky surfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean surface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the considered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and TOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors, be too hot to sustain liquid water on their surface. However, the lower instellation of LHS 1140 b and the non-zero probability of it having a rocky surface give more space for habitable conditions on the planet.</description>

      <title>CHEOPS observations confirm nodal precession in the WASP-33 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to observe the transits and occultations of WASP-33b, which orbits a rapidly-rotating $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via the gravity-darkening effect, and constraining the geometric albedo via the occultation depth. Methods: We observed four transits and four occultations with CHEOPS, and employ a variety of techniques to remove the effects of the stellar pulsations from the light curves, as well as the usual CHEOPS systematic effects. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of low-resolution spectral and Gaia data to re-determine the stellar properties of WASP-33. Results: We measure an orbital obliquity 111.3 +0.2 -0.7 degrees, which is consistent with previous measurements made via Doppler tomography. We also measure the planetary impact parameter, and confirm that this parameter is undergoing rapid secular evolution as a result of nodal precession of the planetary orbit. This precession allows us to determine the second-order fluid Love number of the star, which we find agrees well with the predictions of theoretical stellar models. We are unable to robustly measure a unique value of the occultation depth, and emphasise the need for long-baseline observations to better measure the pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>The High-resolution Accretion Disks of Embedded protoStars (HADES) simulations. I. Impact of Protostellar Magnetic Fields on the Accretion Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How embedded, actively accreting low-mass protostars accrete their mass is still greatly debated. Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of embedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the near-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking, with a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we present high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar mass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10$^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We show the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic fields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For weaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a turbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the protostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically dominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing and ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated due to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the 2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We present bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce observations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an exponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion. Finally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\% of the mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\%. These simulations will be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high resolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of interesting protostellar physics.</description>

      <title>Post-common-envelope planetary nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase - including the possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Dependence of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar metallicity ([Fe/H] and [M/H]) dependence of giant planets around M dwarfs by comparing the metallicity distribution of 746 field M dwarfs without known giant planets with a sample of 22 M dwarfs hosting confirmed giant planets. All metallicity measurements are homogeneously obtained through the same methodology based on the near-infrared spectra collected with a single instrument SpeX mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that 1) giant planets favor metal-rich M dwarfs at a 4-5$\sigma$ confidence level, depending on the band of spectra used to derive metallicity; 2) hot ($a/R_\ast\leq 20$) and warm ($a/R_\ast&gt; 20$) Jupiters do not show a significant difference in the metallicity distribution. Our results suggest that giant planets around M and FGK stars, which are already known to prefer metal-rich hosts, probably have a similar formation channel. In particular, hot and warm Jupiters around M dwarfs may have the same origin as they have indistinguishable metallicity distributions. With the refined stellar and planetary parameters, we examine the stellar metallicities and the masses of giant planets where we find no significant correlation. M dwarfs with multiple giant planets or with a single giant planet have similar stellar metallicities. Mid-to-late type M stars hosting gas giants do not show an apparent preference to higher metallicities compared with those early-M dwarfs with gas giants and field M dwarfs.</description>
