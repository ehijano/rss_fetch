      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time immunization number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete-time immunization version of the SEIS compartment model of infection by a contagious disease, with an extended latency and protective period. The population is modeled by a graph $H$ where vertices represent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close connections. Our objective is to clear the population of infection while minimizing the maximum number of immunizations that occur at each time-step. We prove that this minimum is bounded above by a natural function of the pathwidth of $H$. In addition to our general results, we also focus on the case where the latency and protective periods last for one time-step. In this case, we characterize graphs that require only one immunization per time-step, provide a useful tool for proving lower bounds, and show that, for any tree $T$, there is a subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two immunizations per time-step.</description>

      <title>Temporal network modeling with online and hidden vertices based on the birth and death process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks have played an important role in describing real complex systems since the end of the last century. Recently, research on real-world data sets reports intermittent interaction among social individuals. In this paper, we pay attention to this typical phenomenon of intermittent interaction by considering the state transition of network vertices between online and hidden based on the birth and death process. By continuous-time Markov theory, we show that both the number of each vertex's online neighbors and the online network size are stable and follow the homogeneous probability distribution in a similar form, inducing similar statistics as well. In addition, all propositions are verified via simulations. Moreover, we also present the degree distributions based on small-world and scale-free networks and find some regular patterns by simulations. The application in fitting real networks is discussed.</description>

      <title>COARA will not save science from the tyranny of administrative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Could the generalized adoption of the COARA principles make administrative research evaluation socially desirable and solve all its problems? The answer to this question is no. To reach this conclusion, two main arguments are discussed. The first characterises COARA as a form of 'technocracy' perfectly consistent with a neo-liberal view of research. The second consists in the adoption of Philip Kitcher's idea of well-ordered science. It is argued that administrative evaluation of research, even if correct on the basis of COARA principles, is at odds with the principles of well-ordered science since it cannot escape neither the tyranny of expertise nor the tyranny of ignorance. These two arguments allow to suggest limiting administrative evaluation to the bare minimum (recruitment of researchers and funding of projects), and to focus attention mainly to the fairness of evaluation procedures.</description>

Abstract: For a uniformly distributed population, we show that with high probability, any majority-minority voting district containing a fraction of the population necessarily exhibits a tiny Polsby-Popper score.</description>
