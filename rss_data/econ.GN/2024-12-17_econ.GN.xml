      <title>Re-examining the social impact of silver monetization in the Ming Dynasty from the perspective of supply and demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies have shown that the monetization of silver in the Ming Dynasty effectively promoted the prosperity of trade in the Ming Dynasty, while the prices of labor, handicraft products and grain were long suppressed by the deformed economic structure. With the expansion of silver application, the fluctuation of silver supply and demand exacerbated the above contradictions. Capital accumulation that should have been obtained through the marketization of labor was easily plundered by the landlord gentry class through silver. This article re-discusses the issue from the perspective of supply and demand. Compared with the increase and then decrease of silver supply, the evolution of silver demand is more complicated: at the tax level, the widespread use of silver leads to a huge difference in the elasticity of production and trade taxes. When government spending surges, the increase in tax burden will be mainly borne by agriculture and handicrafts. At the production level, the high liquidity of silver makes the concentration of social wealth more convenient, while the reduction in silver supply and the expansion of demand have rapidly expanded deflation, further exacerbating the gap between the rich and the poor. Such combined effect of supply and demand factors has caused the monetization of silver to become an accelerator of the economic collapse of the Ming Dynasty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many non-cooperative settings, agents often possess useful information that provide an advantage over their opponent(s), but acting on such information too frequently can lead to detection. I develop a simple framework to analyze such a trade-off and characterize the optimal way in which to act on information.</description>

      <title>On Prior Confidence and Belief Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the difference between confidence in a belief distribution versus confidence over multiple priors using a lab experiment. Theory predicts that the average Bayesian posterior is affected by the former but is unaffected by the latter. We manipulate confidence over multiple priors by varying the time subjects view a black-and-white grid, of which the relative composition represents the prior. We find that when subjects view the grid for a longer duration, they have more confidence, under-update more, placing more weight on priors and less weight on signals when updating. Confidence within a belief distribution is varied by changing the prior beliefs; subjects are insensitive to this notion of confidence. Overall we find that confidence over multiple priors matters when it should not and confidence in prior beliefs does not matter when it should.</description>

      <title>Binary or nonbinary? An evolutionary learning approach to gender identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is gender identity binary or nonbinary? My analysis shows that while both are possible, the latter is a more attracting equilibrium under an adaptive learning perspective. I frame the gender identity problem as a modified \textit{battle of the sexes} game, where individuals define their gender identity under pairwise matching motives. From a baseline game-theoretical standpoint, I demonstrate that the binary-only world and the nonbinary-only world are both Nash equilibria in the stage game and are locally stable in the infinitely repeated game. Thus, any state of gender identity could theoretically persist. I then adopt a genetic learning algorithm as an equilibrium selection criterion to investigate evolutionary dynamics further and provide a rationale for the transition from binary to nonbinary gender identity. Specifically, in a binary-origin world, divergence occurs as individuals identifying as nonbinary gender evolve to become the majority due to their higher flexibility in matching outcomes. My framework captures how adaptive learning drives identity evolution, offering a parsimonious tool to analyze how diversity and exclusivity emerge in varying economic environments.</description>

      <title>Transition dynamics of electricity asset-owning firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite dramatic growth and cost improvements in renewables, existing energy companies exhibit significant inertia in adapting to the evolving technological landscape. This study examines technology transition patterns by analyzing over 140,000 investments in power assets over more than two decades, focusing on how firms expand existing technology holdings and adopt new technologies. Building on our comprehensive micro-level dataset, we provide a number of quantitative metrics on global investment dynamism and the evolution of technology portfolios. We find that only about 10\% of firms experience capacity changes in a given year, and that technology portfolios of firms are highly concentrated and persistent in time. We also identify a small subset of frequently investing firms that tend to be large and are key drivers of global technology-specific capacity expansion. Technology transitions within companies are extremely rare. Less than 3% of the more than 8,400 fossil fuel-dominated firms have substantially transformed their portfolios to a renewable focus and firms fully transitioning to renewables are, up-to-date, virtually non-existent. Notably, firms divesting into renewables do not exhibit very characteristic technology-transition patterns but rather follow idiosyncratic transition pathways. Our results quantify the complex technology diffusion dynamics and the diverse corporate responses to a changing technology landscape, highlighting the challenge of designing general policies aimed at fostering technological transitions at the level of firms.</description>

      <title>Multiplexing in Networks and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social and economic networks are often multiplexed, meaning that people are connected by different types of relationships -- such as borrowing goods and giving advice. We make three contributions to the study of multiplexing. First, we document empirical multiplexing patterns in Indian village data: relationships such as socializing, advising, helping, and lending are correlated but distinct, while commonly used proxies for networks based on ethnicity and geography are nearly uncorrelated with actual relationships. Second, we examine how these layers and their overlap affect information diffusion in a field experiment. The advice network is the best predictor of diffusion, but combining layers improves predictions further. Villages with greater overlap between layers (more multiplexing) experience less overall diffusion. This leads to our third contribution: developing a model and theoretical results about diffusion in multiplex networks. Multiplexing slows the spread of simple contagions, such as diseases or basic information, but can either impede or enhance the spread of complex contagions, such as new technologies, depending on their virality. Finally, we identify differences in multiplexing by gender and connectedness. These have implications for inequality in diffusion-mediated outcomes such as access to information and adherence to norms.</description>

      <title>Energetic closure of the spatially resolved global food system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global food system provides the energy that supports human metabolism, with complex spatial interdependencies between food production, transformation, and consumption. Empirical food system data for these global processes are often fragmented and inconsistent, with only certain components captured in spatially resolved formats. Here we propose a flexible approach to allocating country-level food system data subnationally. We estimate the spatial patterns of food energy production and supply, which we compare to estimates of human metabolism based on average body size. We downscale these rates onto a one-degree resolution grid with 95 corresponding food types to derive an internally consistent, energy-conserving, and spatially resolved dataset. We show that national food supply varies linearly with metabolism per capita, with about half the variation in food supply explained by metabolic rates. Our data processing pipeline is openly available and can readily incorporate new inputs in order to advance trans-disciplinary food system modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Is Polarization an Inevitable Outcome of Similarity-Based Content Recommendations? -- Mathematical Proofs and Computational Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on digital platforms shapes how individuals understand the world, as recommendation systems direct users toward content "similar" to their existing preferences. While this process simplifies information retrieval, there is concern that it may foster insular communities, so-called echo chambers, reinforcing existing viewpoints and limiting exposure to alternatives. To investigate whether such polarization emerges from fundamental principles of recommendation systems, we propose a minimal model that represents users and content as points in a continuous space. Users iteratively move toward the median of locally recommended items, chosen by nearest-neighbor criteria, and we show mathematically that they naturally coalesce into distinct, stable clusters without any explicit ideological bias. Computational simulations confirm these findings and explore how population size, adaptation rates, content production probabilities, and noise levels modulate clustering speed and intensity. Our results suggest that similarity-based retrieval, even in simplified scenarios, drives fragmentation. While we do not claim all systems inevitably cause polarization, we highlight that such retrieval is not neutral. Recognizing the geometric underpinnings of recommendation spaces may inform interventions, policies, and critiques that address unintended cultural and ideological divisions.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Asset Price Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider volume weighted average price (VWAP) as the 1st market-based statistical moment and derive the dependence of higher statistical moments of price on statistical moments and correlations of the values and volumes of market trades. If all trade volumes are constant during the averaging interval, then the market-based statistical moments equal the frequency-based. We approximate market-based probability of price by a finite number of statistical moments. The use of VWAP results in zero price-volume correlations. We derive the expressions of market-based correlations between prices and squares of trade volumes and between squares of prices and volumes. To forecast market-based averages and volatility of asset prices, one should predict two statistical moments and the correlation of their trade values and volumes. We explain how that limits the number of predicted statistical moments of prices by the first two and limits the accuracy of the forecasts of the probability of asset prices by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the accuracy and reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like those developed by BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of asset prices.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Probability of Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the dependence of market-based statistical moments of returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade values. We use Markowitz's definition of value weighted return of a portfolio as the definition of market-based average return of trades during the averaging period. Then we derive the dependence of market-based volatility and higher statistical moments of returns on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current and past trade values. We derive the approximations of the characteristic function and the probability of returns by a finite number q of market-based statistical moments. To forecast market-based average and volatility of returns at horizon T, one should predict the first two statistical moments and correlation of current and past trade values at the same horizon. We discuss the economic reasons that limit the number of predicted statistical moments of returns by the first two. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of probability of returns by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of returns.</description>

      <title>A Global Minimum Tax for Large Firms Only: Implications for Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14302v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Global Minimum Tax (GMT) is applied only to firms above a certain size threshold, permitting countries to set differential tax rates for small and large firms. We analyze tax competition among multiple tax havens and a non-haven country for heterogeneous multinationals to evaluate the effects of this partial coverage of GMT. Upon the introduction of a moderately low GMT rate, the havens commit to the single uniform GMT rate for all multinationals. However, gradual increases in the GMT rate induce the havens, and subsequently the non-haven, to adopt discriminatory, lower tax rates for small multinationals. Our calibration exercise shows that the implementation of a 15% GMT rate results in a regime where only the havens adopt split tax rates. Upon GMT introduction, welfare and tax revenues fall in the tax havens but rise in the non-haven, yielding a positive net gain worldwide.</description>

      <title>India's residential space cooling transition: A carbon perspective from 2000 onward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an emerging emitter poised for significant growth in space cooling demand, India requires comprehensive insights into historical emission trends and decarbonization performance to shape future low-carbon cooling strategies. By integrating a bottom-up demand resource energy analysis model and a top-down decomposition method, this study is the first to conduct a state-level analysis of carbon emission trends and the corresponding decarbonization efforts for residential space cooling in urban and rural India from 2000 to 2022. The results indicate that (1) the carbon intensity of residential space cooling in India increased by 292.4% from 2000 to 2022, reaching 513.8 kilograms of carbon dioxide per household. The net state domestic product per capita, representing income, emerged as the primary positive contributor. (2) The increase in carbon emissions from space cooling can be primarily attributed to the use of fans. While fan-based space cooling has nearly saturated Indian urban households, it is anticipated to persist as the primary cooling method in rural households for decades. (3) States with higher decarbonization potential are concentrated in two categories: those with high household income and substantial cooling appliance ownership and those with pronounced unmet cooling demand but low household income and hot climates. Furthermore, it is believed that promoting energy-efficient building designs can be prioritized to achieve affordable space cooling. Overall, this study serves as an effective foundation for formulating and promoting India's future cooling action plan, addressing the country's rising residential cooling demands and striving toward its net-zero goal by 2070.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion or Competition: the Role of Platforms' Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent scholarly work has extensively examined the phenomenon of algorithmic collusion driven by AI-enabled pricing algorithms. However, online platforms commonly deploy recommender systems that influence how consumers discover and purchase products, thereby shaping the reward structures faced by pricing algorithms and ultimately affecting competition dynamics and equilibrium outcomes. To address this gap in the literature and elucidate the role of recommender systems, we propose a novel repeated game framework that integrates several key components. We first develop a structural search model to characterize consumers' decision-making processes in response to varying recommendation sets. This model incorporates both observable and unobservable heterogeneity in utility and search cost functions, and is estimated using real-world data. Building on the resulting consumer model, we formulate personalized recommendation algorithms designed to maximize either platform revenue or consumer utility. We further introduce pricing algorithms for sellers and integrate all these elements to facilitate comprehensive numerical experiments. Our experimental findings reveal that a revenue-maximizing recommender system intensifies algorithmic collusion, whereas a utility-maximizing recommender system encourages more competitive pricing behavior among sellers. Intriguingly, and contrary to conventional insights from the industrial organization and choice modeling literature, increasing the size of recommendation sets under a utility-maximizing regime does not consistently enhance consumer utility. Moreover, the degree of horizontal differentiation moderates this phenomenon in unexpected ways. The "more is less" effect does not arise at low levels of differentiation, but becomes increasingly pronounced as horizontal differentiation increases.</description>
