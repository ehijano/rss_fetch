      <title>Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction: I. General framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Hawking showed that natural states for free quantum matter fields on classical spacetimes that solve the spherically symmetric vacuum Einstein equations are KMS states of non-vanishing temperature. Although Hawking's calculation does not include backreaction of matter on geometry, it is more than plausible that the corresponding Hawking radiation leads to black hole evaporation which is in principle observable.
  Obviously, an improvement of Hawking's calculation including backreaction is a problem of quantum gravity. Since no commonly accepted quantum field theory of general relativity is available yet, it has been difficult to reliably derive the backreaction effect. An obvious approach is to use black hole perturbation theory of a Schwarzschild black hole of fixed mass and to quantise those perturbations. But it is not clear how to reconcile perturbation theory with gauge invariance beyond linear perturbations.
  In a recent work we proposed a new approach to this problem that applies when the physical situation has an approximate symmetry, such as homogeneity (cosmology), spherical symmetry (Schwarzschild) or axial symmetry (Kerr). The idea, which is surprisingly feasible, is to first construct the non-perturbative physical (reduced) Hamiltonian of the reduced phase space of fully gauge invariant observables and only then to apply perturbation theory directly in terms of observables. The task to construct observables is then disentangled from perturbation theory, thus allowing to unambiguosly develop perturbation theory to arbitrary orders.
  In this first paper of the the series we outline and showcase this approach for spherical symmetry and second order in the perturbations for Einstein-Klein-Gordon-Maxwell theory. Details and generalisation to other matter and symmetry and higher orders will appear in subsequent companion papers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction II. Spherically symmetric 2nd order Einstein sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second paper of our series we focus on the classical pure gravity sector of spherically symmetric black hole perturbations and expand the reduced Hamiltonian to second order. To compare our manifestly gauge invariant formalism with established results in the literature we have to translate our results derived in Gullstrand-Painlev\'e gauge to the gauges used in those works. After several canonical transformations we expectedly find exact agreement with the Hamiltonian given by Moncrief which generates the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations of motion for the linear axial (often denoted odd) and polar (often denoted even) perturbations respectively. This confirms the validity of our method which immediately generalises to higher orders.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend reduced phase space approach to black hole perturbation theory to Maxwell matter. We expand the resulting reduced Hamiltonian to second order in the graviton and photon perturbations and find that the corresponding equations of motion match the ones derived in the literature. Accordingly our approach reproduces previous results at second order. Its real virtue lies in the fact that it extends to any order in perturbation theory in a manifestly gauge invariant fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze traversable wormholes defined by the dynamic line elements that asymptotically approaches Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. This dynamical wormholes is supported by the galactic dark matter as well as perfect isotropic fluid. We will discuss several evolving Lorentzian wormholes comprising with different perfect isotropic fluids in addition to various scale factors. We will speculate the various significance, features and throat energy conditions for these evolving traversable Lorentzian wormholes.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the cosmological constant problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities in Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the earlier linear studies of cosmological peculiar velocities to Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature. In the process, we also compare our results with those obtained in cosmologies with Euclidean spatial sections. Employing relativistic cosmological perturbation theory, we first provide the differential formulae governing the evolution of peculiar velocities on all Friedmann backgrounds. The technical complexities of the curved models, however, mean that analytic solutions are possible only in special, though characteristic, moments in the lifetime of these universes. Nevertheless, our solutions exhibit persistent patterns that make us confident enough to generalise them. Thus, we confirm earlier claims that, compared to the Newtonian studies, the relativistic analysis supports considerably stronger linear growth-rates for peculiar-velocity perturbations. This result holds irrespective of the background curvature. Moreover, for positive curvature, the peculiar growth-rate is found to be faster than that obtained in a spatially flat Friedman universe. In contrast, linear peculiar velocities appear to grow at a slower pace when their Friedmann host is spatially open. Extrapolating them to the present, our results seem to suggest faster bulk peculiar motions in overdense, rather than in underdense, regions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Quark Stars in Modified $f(R,T)$ Gravity utilizing Tolman V potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative gravity theory is currently an incredibly significant technique for addressing some enduring experimental difficulties, such as the universe's dark region. They may also be employed in celestial cosmology, producing results that are a stage beyond those found using Einstein's General Relativity. In this study, we examine the characteristics of anisotropic spherically symmetric stellar structures in the context of modified $f(R,T)$ gravity. In order to explain the distinctive characteristics of compact objects, we investigate how the fluid distribution in the star model is affected by the MIT bag model equation of state. By using Tolman V metric potentials, we establish the field equations, and by employing the experimental data of the three observed stars, we identify the values of unknown parameters. By using a realistic $f(R,T)$ model, we investigate the effect of the energy density, anisotropic factor, transversal and radial pressure within the cores of the aforementioned stars for a particular amount of the Bag constant. Further, we examine the stability of the cosmic structure and the physical validity of our suggested model via equilibrium conditions, energy, and causality parameters. To conclude, the physical conditions are fulfilled by our model, and the magnitude of the Bag constant agrees with the experimental data, demonstrating the model's feasibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalar field with an exponential potential in FLRW universe admits the exact solution. We uncover the hidden symmetries behind the system by utilising the Eisenhart lift of field theories. We find that a conformal Killing vector field in the field space exists only for a particular combination of exponential functions which includes a single exponential potential. This implies the existence of additional conserved quantity and explains the integrability of the system.</description>

Abstract: In this short paper, we study Majorana fermions in terms of a modified Chandrasekhar's separation for the Dirac equation in Kerr-Newman-type spacetimes. If the electric charge or magnetic charge is nonzero, we show that nontrivial differentiable time-periodic Majorana fermions do not exist outside the event horizon in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetimes, and between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum strategy for locating Unruh channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of quantum information theory, the effect of Unruh radiation on a two-level accelerated detector can be modeled as a quantum channel. In this work, we employ the tools of channel-position finding to locate Unruh channels. The signal-idler and idler-free protocols are explored to determine the position of the target Unruh channel within a sequence of background channels. We derive the fidelity-based bounds for the ultimate error probability of each strategy and obtain the conditions where the signal-idler protocol is superior to the protocol involving idler-free states. It is found that the lower bound of the error probability for the signal-idler scheme exhibits clear advantages in all cases, while the idler-free scheme can only be implemented when the temperature of the two channels is very close and the number of initial states is insufficient. Interestingly, it is shown that the optimal detection protocol relies on the residual correlations shared between the emitted probe state and the retained idler modes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field and chaotic charged-particle motion around hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wald vector potential is an exact solution of the source-less Maxwell equations regarding an electromagnetic field of a vacuum uncharged black hole like the Kerr background black hole in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. However, it is not if the black hole is a nonvacuum solution in a theory of modified gravity with extra fields or a charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. To satisfy the source-less Maxwell equations in this case, the Wald vector potential must be modified and generalized appropriately. Following this idea, we derive an expression for the vector potential of an electromagnetic field surrounding a hairy black hole in the Horndeski modified gravity theory. Explicit symplectic integrators with excellent long-term behaviour are used to simulate the motion of charged particles around the hairy black hole immersed in the external magnetic field. The recurrence plot method based on the recurrence quantification analysis uses diagonal structures parallel to the main diagonal to show regular dynamics, but adopts no diagonal structures to indicate chaotic dynamics. The method is efficient to detect chaos from order in the curved spacetime, as the Poincare map and the fast Lyapunov indicator are.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An study of the equatorial circular motion of photons and massive particles around a rotating compact body like a neutron star is presented. For this goal, we use an approximate Kerr-like metric with mass quadrupole as perturbation. The effect of this deformation on the photon sphere, and the innermost stable circular orbit, is determined via an effective potential. Furthermore, a stability anaysis is shown, where we observed the same behavior of the effective potential for co-rotating and counter-rotating particles. A comparison with the results for the innermost stable circular orbit obtained for the Hartle-Thorne spacetime is also presented.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss the generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity theory with a nonminimal coupling between the Maxwell field and scalar field. Considering different geometric properties of black hole horizon structure, the charged dilaton Lifshitz black hole solutions are presented in 4-dimensional spacetimes. Later, utilizing the Wald Formalism, we derive the thermodynamic first law of black hole and conserved quantities. According to the relationship between the heat capacity and the local stability of black hole, we study the stability of charged Lifshitz black holes and identify the thermodynamic stable region of black holes that meet the criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of the complete quadratic (in torsion and nonmetricity) metric-affine gravity. Namely, we add to the scalar-curvature gravitational Lagrangian, the 17 independent quadratic (parity-even and parity-odd) torsion and nonmetricity invariants. Sticking to a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and assuming a perfect hyperfluid source, we explore the new effects that torsion and nonmetricity bring into play. It is shown that the inclusion of these invariants offers rich phenomenology. In particular, some well-known examples of exotic matter like cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff matter, etc., emerge quite naturally as manifestations of the fluid's intrinsic structure (hypermomentum). By studying the extended Friedmann equations in the complete quadratic theory and isolating the various parts of the hypermomentum, we find a plethora of solutions with interesting features.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scalarization of Schwarzschild black holes in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fully nonlinear mechanism for obtaining scalarized black holes in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) gravity which is beyond the spontaneous scalarization. Introducing three coupling functions $f(\varphi)$ satisfying $f''(0) = 0$, we find that Schwarzschild black hole is linearly stable against scalar perturbation, whereas it is unstable against nonlinear scalar perturbation if the coupling function includes term higher than $\varphi^6$. For a specific choice of coupling function $f(\varphi)=\alpha(\varphi^4-\beta\varphi^6)$, we obtain new black holes with scalar hair in the EsGB gravity. In this case, the coupling parameter $\alpha$ plays a major role in making different nonlinear scalarized black holes, while the other parameter $\beta$ plays a supplementary role. Furthermore, we study thermodynamic aspects of these scalarized black holes and prove the first-law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing Using Werner's Method in Cartesian-like Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Werner method for calculating deflection angles using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and optical/Jacobi metric has become widely popular in recent years. Werner extended this method to stationary spacetimes, where the optical/Jacobi metric takes the form of a Finsler metric of Randers type, by adopting an osculating Riemannian metric. Werner's method is significant as it provides a concise expression for the deflection angle, retains applicability for gravitational lensing in Finsler geometry beyond the Randers type, and has the potential to stimulate widespread application of Finsler geometry across diverse fields. However, because of the cumbersome calculations required in Werner's method using conventional coordinates $(r,\phi)$, it has not been widely adopted. The aim of this paper is to alleviate the computational burden associated with Werner's method. To this end, we introduce Cartesian-like coordinates $(X,Y)$ to construct the osculating Riemannian metric and calculate the deflection angle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We illustrate the current method with examples of the deflection of massive particles in Kerr spacetime, rotating Bardeen (Hayward) regular spacetime, and Teo rotating wormhole spacetime, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Geometric algebra (GA) is a formalism capable of describing all fields of physics with elegance, simplifying mathematics and providing new physical insights. Due to the coordinate dependence of tensor formalism, General Relativity(GR) is a challenging subject known for its complicated calculations and interpretation, which has not been thoroughly translated into GA until now.
  In this paper, we introduce GR with GA, emphasizing the physical interpretation of quantities and providing a step-by-step guide on performing calculations. In doing so, we show how GA provides insightful information on the physical meaning of the connection coefficients, the Riemann tensor and other physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Early dark energy and scalarization in a scalar-tensor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model in which the Gauss-Bonnet invariant holds the quintessence at a fixed point, respecting an initial $Z_2$ symmetry in the radiation-dominated era. This results in an early dark energy, which becomes significant around the matter-radiation equality era. However, due to $Z_2$ symmetry breaking, scalarization occurs, leading to a rapid reduction in the early dark energy density. The model then quickly behaves like the $\Lambda$CDM model. This scenario alleviates the Hubble tension and aligns with the assumption that the gravitational wave speed is infinitesimally close to the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Building the Blocks of Schwarzschild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild black hole can be ``resolved'' into bound states of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in four dimensions. These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies. These solutions pave the way for analogous constructions in supergravity and for a brane/anti-brane description of the Schwarzschild black hole in string theory.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Track of the GD-1 Stellar Stream Inside a Host with a Fermionic Dark Matter Core-Halo Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum of an accelerating observer is defined on the local inertial frame, which is called a ``moving frame''. However, in the discussion of the Unruh-deWitt detector, many papers define the vacuum on a fixed frame. This paper discusses the Unruh-deWitt detector by defining the vacuum directly on the local inertial frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the exact WKB.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Quintom cosmology and modified gravity after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \cite{DESI:2024mwx} combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$.</description>

      <title>Soft pattern of gravitational Rutherford scattering from heavy target mass expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the soft behavior of the tree-level Rutherford scattering processes mediated via $t$-channel one-graviton exchange. We consider two types of Rutherford scattering processes, {\it e.g.}, a low-energy massless structureless projectile (up to spin-$1$) hits a static massive composite particle carrying various spins (up to spin-$2$), and a slowly-moving light projectile hits a heavy static composite target. The unpolarized cross sections in the first type are found to exhibit universal forms at the first two orders in $1/M$ expansion, yet differ at the next-to-next-to-leading order, though some terms at this order still remain universal or depend on the target spin in a definite manner. The unpolarized cross sections in the second type are universal at the lowest order in projectile velocity expansion and through all orders in $1/M$, independent of the spins of both projectile and target. The universality partially breaks down at relative order-$v^2/M^2$, albeit some terms at this order still depend on the target spin in a specific manner.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Tunneling Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tunneling Potential Formalism was introduced to calculate the tunneling actions that control vacuum decay as an alternative to the standard Euclidean Formalism. The new approach sets the problem as a simple variational problem in field space with decay described by a tunneling potential function $V_t$ that extremizes a simple action functional $S[V_t]$ and has a number of appealing properties that have been presented elsewhere. In this note I discuss several instances in which this $V_t$ approach seems to give more than one would have expected a priori, as the following: the $V_t$ describing the decay is a minimum of the new action $S[V_t]$ rather than a saddle point; the decay of AdS, dS or Minkowski vacua are governed by a unique universal $S[V_t]$ which also gives the Hawking-Moss instanton in the appropriate limit; physically relevant solutions beyond the Coleman-De Luccia (CdL) bounce, like pseudo-bounces or bubbles of nothing (BoNs), show up in a straightforward way as generalizations of the CdL bounce, with the correct boundary conditions; in cases for which the Euclidean action calculation requires the inclusion of particular boundary terms (like for BoNs or for the decay of AdS maxima above the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound) $S[V_t]$ gives the correct result without the need of including any boundary term.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. How these two contributions are distributed has not been seriously investigated. Meanwhile, a dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields, whose application to cosmology is not straightforward. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral gravitational waves around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that resembles the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis scenario. This approach allows us to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we conjecture that level-crossing does not seem to be efficient while the charge accumulation in the vacuum likely takes place. Phenomenological implication is also discussed in the context of gravitational leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: We study an isotropic flat FLRW-model in Scale-covariant theory of gravity $ f_{\gamma \delta}(\phi) $ \cite{Canuto:1977zz} which is explained in terms of ordinary and covariant differentiation of scalar field $ \phi $. As we know the deceleration parameter is time-dependent, so we consider the deceleration parameter $ q $ as the function of $ t $. Using this methodology, we find all the important cosmological factors in terms of a hyperbolic function of the cosmic time $ t $. In turn, we create the model having the behavior of the late-time universe, which is ever accelerated expanding and faces a Big Freeze at the end. The model shows the quintessence dark energy model from early to late times. We compute the constrained values of Hubble parameter $ H_0=70.979^{+0.021}_{-0.0043} $ and the model parameter $ n=1.24079^{+0.00015}_{-0.00079} $ using joint analysis of the $ OHD $ data of 77-points and Pantheon bin data. The model exhibits point-type singularity, beginning with a point of zero volume, infinite energy density, and temperature. Furthermore, we obtain the present deceleration parameter $ (q_0) \approx {-0.54} $. Also, we examine the ultimate behavior of our model by properly analyzing energy conditions, cosmographical parameters, and Statefinder diagnostic. Finally, the proposed model behaves like a quintessence dark energy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a two-fluid interacting model in a flat FLRW universe has been studied considering particle creation mechanism with a particular form of particle creation rate $\Gamma=\Gamma_0 H+\frac{\Gamma_1}{H}$ from different aspects. Statistical analysis with a combined data set of SNe Ia (Supernovae Type Ia) and Hubble data is performed to achieve the best-fit values of the model parameters, and the model is compatible with current observational data. We also perform a dynamical analysis of this model to get an overall qualitative description of the cosmological evolution by converting the governing equations into a system of ordinary differential equations considering a proper transformation of variables. We find some non-isolated sets of critical points, among which some usually are normally hyperbolic sets of points that describe the present acceleration of the universe dominated by dark energy mimicking cosmological constant or phantom fluid. Scaling solutions are also obtained from this analysis, and they can alleviate the coincidence problem successfully. Statefinder diagnosis is also carried out for this model to compare it with the $\Lambda$CDM, and any other dark energy models by finding various statefinder parameters. Finally, the thermodynamic analysis shows that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid in an irreversible thermodynamic context.</description>

Abstract: To explore the influence of the cosmological constant on black hole images, we have developed a comprehensive analytical method for simulating images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by equatorial thin accretion disks. Through the application of explicit equations, we simulate images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by both prograde and retrograde accretion disks, examining the impact of the cosmological constant on their characteristic curves, relative sizes, and observed intensities. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to Kerr black holes, the cosmological constant not only diminishes the relative size of a black hole but also amplifies its luminosity. Moreover, an observer's relative position in the universe ($r_0/r_C$) can influence both the relative size and luminosity of a black hole, where $r_0$ is the distance from the observer to the black hole, $r_C$ is the cosmological horizon determined by the value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

Abstract: Gravastars, theoretical alternatives to black holes, have captured the interest of scientists in astrophysics due to their unique properties. This paper aims to further investigate the exact solution of a novel gravastar model based on the Mazur-Mottola (2004) method within the framework of general relativity, specifically by incorporating the cloud of strings and quintessence. By analyzing the gravitational field and energy density of gravastars, valuable insights into the nature of compact objects in the universe can be gained. Understanding the stability of gravastars is also crucial for our comprehension of black holes and alternative compact objects. For this purpose, we present the Einstein field equations with the modified matter source and calculate the exact solutions for the inner and intermediate regions of gravastars. The exterior region is considered as a black hole surrounded by the cloud of strings and quintessence, and the spacetimes are matched using the Darmoise-Israel formalism. {An investigation is conducted on the stability of gravastars using linearized radial perturbation. Additionally, the proper length, energy content, and entropy of the shell are computed. The stability of gravastars is positively correlated with the enhancement of the cloud of strings parameter, while it is negatively correlated with the growth in the quintessence field parameter.} The paper concludes with a summary of the findings and their implications in the field of astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in gravitational waves and observational bounds from third-generation detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze parity-violating effects in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). For this purpose, we adopt a newly proposed parametrized post-Einstenian (PPE) formalism, which encodes modified gravity corrections to the phase and amplitude of GW waveforms. In particular, we focus our study on three well-known examples of parity-violating theories, namely Chern-Simons, Symmetric Teleparallel and Hor\v ava-Lishitz gravity. For each model, we identify the PPE parameters emerging from the inclusion of parity-violating terms in the gravitational Lagrangian. Thus, we use the simulated sensitivities of third-generation GW interferometers, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, to obtain numerical bounds on the PPE coefficients and the physical parameters of binary systems. In so doing, we find that deviations from General Relativity cannot be excluded within given confidence limits. Moreover, our results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in the relative accuracy of the GW parameters compared to the values inferred from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. In this respect, the present work demonstrates the power of next-generation GW detectors to probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Multipole expansion of the gravitational field in a general class of fourth-order theories of gravity and the application in gyroscopic precession</title>

Abstract: A viable weak-field and slow-motion approximation method is constructed in $F(R,R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma})$ gravity, a general class of fourth-order theories of gravity. By applying this method, the metric, presented in the form of the multipole expansion, outside a spatially compact source up to $1/c^3$ order is provided, and the closed-form expressions for the source multipole moments are all presented explicitly. The metric consists of the massless tensor part, the massive scalar part, and the massive tensor part, where the former is exactly the metric in General Relativity, and the latter two are the corrections to it. It is shown that the corrections bear the Yukawa-like dependence on the two massive parameters and predict the appearance of six additional sets of source multipole moments, which indicates that up to $1/c^3$ order, there exist six degrees of freedom beyond General Relativity within $F(R,R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma})$ gravity. By means of the metric, for a gyroscope moving around the source without experiencing any torque, the multipole expansions of its spin's angular velocities of the Thomas precession, the geodetic precession, and the Lense-Thirring precession are derived, and from them, the corrections to the angular velocities of the three types of precession in General Relativity can be read off. These results indicate that differently from $f(R)$ or $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity, the most salient feature of the general $F(R,R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma})$ gravity is that it gives the nonvanishing correction to the gyroscopic spin's angular velocity of the Lense-Thirring precession in General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a master constraint operator on the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity representing a set of gauge conditions which classically fix the densitized triad to be diagonal. We argue that the master constraint approach provides a natural and systematic way of carrying out the quantum gauge-fixing procedure which underlies the model known as quantum-reduced loop gravity. The Hilbert space of quantum-reduced loop gravity is obtained as a particular space of solutions of the gauge-fixing master constraint operator. We give a concise summary of the fundamental structure of the quantum-reduced framework, and consider several possible extensions thereof, for which the master constraint formulation provides a convenient starting point. In particular, we propose a generalization of the standard Hilbert space of quantum-reduced loop gravity, which may be relevant in the application of the quantum-reduced model to physical situations in which the Ashtekar connection is not diagonal.</description>

      <title>Static sphere observers and geodesics in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze null- and spacelike radial geodesics in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime connecting two conjugate static sphere observers, i.e. free-falling observers at a fixed radius in between the two horizons. We explicitly determine the changes in the causal structure with respect to these natural observers as a result of the inward bending of the black hole singularity, as well as the outward bending of asymptotic infinity. Notably, the inward and outward bending changes as a function of the black hole mass, first increasing towards a maximum and then decreasing to vanish in the extreme Nariai limit. For a generic mass of the black hole this implies the existence of finite size (temporal) windows for the presence of symmetric radial geodesics between the static sphere observers probing the interior region of the black hole, as well as the exterior de Sitter region. We determine the size of the interior (black hole) and exterior (de Sitter) temporal windows in $4$, $5$ and $6$ spacetime dimensions, finding that they are equal in $D=5$, and compute the proper lengths of the symmetric radial geodesics. We comment on the implications for information exchange and the potential role of the symmetric radial geodesics in a geodesic approximation of static sphere correlators in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the CMB angular power spectrum obtained using the CAMB code for three different models of inflation: the Starobinsky inflationary model, the generalized Starobinsky inflationary model, and the chaotic inflationary model with a step. The results are compared with the most recent data reported for the Planck mission. An analysis of the large ($l \lesssim 90$), intermediate ($90 \lesssim l \lesssim 900$), and small ($l \gtrsim 900 $) angular scales is performed. We report the position of the peaks in the intermediate region so as the cosmological parameters obtained in each of the models: age of the universe, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, $\Omega_K$ and $n_S$.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity V: Early-Time Asymptotics of Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild for Fixed Spherical Harmonic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from Post-Newtonian predictions for a system of $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past, we formulate and solve a scattering problem for the system of linearised gravity around Schwarzschild as introduced in [DHR19]. The scattering data are posed on a null hypersurface $\mathcal C$ emanating from a section of past null infinity $\mathcal I^-$, and on the part of $\mathcal I^-$ that lies to the future of this section: Along $\mathcal C$, we implement the Post-Newtonian theory-inspired hypothesis that the gauge-invariant components of the Weyl tensor $\alpha$ and $\underline{\alpha}$ (a.k.a. $\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_4$) decay like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-4}$, respectively, and we exclude incoming radiation from $\mathcal I^-$ by demanding the News function to vanish along $\mathcal I^-$.
  We also show that compactly supported gravitational perturbations along $\mathcal I^-$ induce very similar data, with $\alpha$, $\underline{\alpha}$ decaying like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-5}$ along $\mathcal C$.
  After constructing the unique solution to this scattering problem, we provide a complete analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of projections onto fixed spherical harmonic number $\ell$ near spacelike $i^0$ and future null infinity $\mathcal I^+$. Using our results, we also give constructive corrections to popular historical notions of asymptotic flatness such as Bondi coordinates or asymptotic simplicity. In particular, confirming earlier heuristics due to Damour and Christodoulou, we find that the peeling property is violated both near $\mathcal I^-$ and near $\mathcal I^+$, with e.g. $\alpha$ near $\mathcal I^+$ only decaying like $r^{-4}$ instead of $r^{-5}$. We also find that the resulting solution decays slower towards $i^0$ than often assumed, with $\alpha$ decaying like $r^{-3}$ towards $i^0$.
  The issue of summing up the fixed angular mode estimates in $\ell$ is dealt with in forthcoming work.</description>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity is a compelling modified theory of gravity that offers a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem. However, for unimodular gravity to be considered a viable theory of gravity, one has to show that it has a well-posed initial value formulation. Working in vacuum, we apply Dirac's algorithm to find all the constraints of the theory. Then we prove that, for initial data compatible with these constraints, the evolution is well posed. Finally, we find sufficient conditions for a matter action to preserve the well-posedness of the initial value problem of unimodular gravity. As a corollary, we argue that the "unimodular" restriction on the spacetime volume element can be satisfied by a suitable choice of the lapse function.</description>

      <title>Constraining study of charged gravastars solutions in symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the effect of charge on a special astronomical object known as a gravastar, which is viewed as an alternative to a black hole. Based on the conjecture put out by Mazur and Mottola in general relativity, the study primarily focuses on the consequences of $f(Q)$ gravity. The internal domain, the intermediate shell, and the external domain are the three separate sections that make up a gravastar. Using a particular $f(Q)$ gravity model that includes conformal Killing vectors to analyze these areas, we discover that the inner domain shows a repulsive force on the spherical shell since it is assumed that pressure is equivalent to negative energy density. The intermediate shell is made up of ultrarelativistic plasma and pressure, which is proportional to energy density and balances the repulsive force from the interior domain. For exterior region, we use two appraoches as first we calculate the vacuum exact solution and secondly considered as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. Then, we match these spacetimes through junction condition and explore the stability constraints for both cases. Our results show that charged gravastar solutions with non-singular physical parameters including length, energy, entropy, and equation of state parameter are physically realistic.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the old problem of the energy-momentum tensor in general relativistic field theories. On the basis of the general covariance we derive a simple equation for the Hilbert and Noether energy-momentum tensors for the scalar and electromagnetic field theories. We see that the two definitions of energy-momentum tensors coincide and identify the Noether current if the space-time has the Killing vector. Relation to the Wald entropy is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation for ensembles of universes having non-zero angular power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induce correlated perturbations to the arrival times of pulses from an array of galactic millisecond pulsars. The expected correlations, obtained by averaging over many pairs of pulsars having the same angular separation (pulsar averaging) and over an ensemble of model universes (ensemble averaging), are described by the Hellings and Downs curve. As shown by Allen [1], the pulsar-averaged correlation will not agree exactly with the expected Hellings and Downs prediction if the gravitational-wave sources interfere with one another, differing instead by a "cosmic variance" contribution. The precise shape and size of the cosmic variance depends on the statistical properties of the ensemble of universes used to model the background. Here, we extend the calculations of the cosmic variance for the standard Gaussian ensemble to an ensemble of model universes which collectively has rotationally-invariant correlations in the GW power on different angular scales (described by an angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$ for $\ell=0,1,\cdots$.). We obtain an analytic form for the cosmic variance in terms of the $C_\ell$'s and show that for realistic values $C_{\ell}/C_0\lesssim 10^{-3}$, there is virtually no difference in the cosmic variance compared to that for the standard Gaussian ensemble (which has zero angular power spectra).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since its discovery by Roy Kerr in 1963, the geometry around rotating, electrostatically-neutral black holes, otherwise known as Kerr black holes, has significantly contributed to theoretical developments in the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and beyond. Extremal Kerr black holes, in which the spin parameter of the rotating black hole is at a maximum without breaching certain postulates, has especially been of interest to the research community due to its sensitivity to higher order corrections to Einstein's theory of relativity. In this paper, we review some unresolved open questions regarding the discontinuity of certain properties of the Kerr black hole as it approaches the extreme limit. These include the form of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the nature of vanishing entropy, and the disappearance of the trapped surface as a Kerr black hole approaches extremality. We conclude that current theories are likely not suitable for studies of extremal black holes, and we posit that further development in theory may likely require a quantum approach to gravity. G=c=1 and Einstein summation convention are assumed throughout this paper.</description>

Abstract: We show that the geometry of the asymptotic infinities of Minkowski spacetime (in $d+1$ dimensions) is captured by homogeneous spaces of the Poincar\'e group: the blow-ups of spatial (Spi) and timelike (Ti) infinities in the sense of Ashtekar--Hansen and a novel space Ni fibering over $\mathscr{I}$. We embed these spaces \`a la Penrose--Rindler into a pseudo-euclidean space of signature $(d+1,2)$ as orbits of the same Poincar\'e subgroup of O$(d+1,2)$. We describe the corresponding Klein pairs and determine their Poincar\'e-invariant structures: a carrollian structure on Ti, a pseudo-carrollian structure on Spi and a "doubly-carrollian" structure on Ni. We give additional geometric characterisations of these spaces as grassmannians of affine hyperplanes in Minkowski spacetime: Spi is the (double cover of the) grassmannian of affine lorentzian hyperplanes; Ti is the grassmannian of affine spacelike hyperplanes and Ni fibers over the grassmannian of affine null planes, which is $\mathscr{I}$. We exhibit Ni as the fibred product of $\mathscr{I}$ and the lightcone over the celestial sphere. We also show that Ni is the total space of the bundle of scales of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$ and show that the symmetry algebra of its doubly-carrollian structure is isomorphic to the symmetry algebra of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$; that is, the BMS algebra. We show how to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime from any of its asymptotic geometries, by establishing that points in Minkowski spacetime parametrise certain lightcone cuts in the asymptotic geometries. We include an appendix comparing with (A)dS and observe that the de Sitter groups have no homogeneous spaces which could play the r\^ole that the celestial sphere plays in flat space holography.</description>

      <title>On the detection and precise localisation of merging black holes events through strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the full spectrum of astrophysical and cosmological applications of gravitational-wave detections, it is essential to localise the associated black-hole mergers to high precision inside their host galaxies. One possible method to achieve this is to compare the properties of multiple detections of gravitationally-lensed binary black-hole merger events with the properties of strong gravitational lens systems located in the joint sky localisation of the gravitational-wave detections. In this work, we simulate the population of binary black-hole mergers lensed by galaxy-scale lenses and detectable by LIGO-Virgo-Kagra in the coming decade and the population of galaxy-scale strong lenses that will be detected by Euclid. We use these simulations to investigate the prospects for localising strongly lensed binary black-hole mergers inside the lensed galaxies of 'Euclid-like' galaxy-scale strong lenses. We find that for 20-50% of strongly lensed gravitational wave events the lens system is detectable with Euclid, if the event falls in its survey footprint. Of these, we expect to correctly identify the strongly-lensed host galaxy as likely (with posterior probability) host galaxy - based on Bayesian evidence ranking of candidate hosts - for 34.6-21.9% of quadruply-lensed gravitational-wave events when given an a-priori 1-5 deg^2 gravitational-wave-only sky localisation. For triply and doubly lensed gravitational-wave events, this becomes 29.8-14.9% and 16.4-6.6% respectively. If successfully identified, however, the localisation can be better than a fraction of the host-galaxy size, i.e. of order milli-arcseconds. A first detection in the coming decade, however, probably requires dedicated deep and high-resolution follow-ups and continued upgrades in the current and planned gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Wave map null form estimates via Peter-Weyl theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spacetime estimates for the wave map null form $Q_0$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. By using the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3$ and Peter-Weyl theory, combined with the time-periodicity of the conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we extend the classical ideas of Klainerman and Machedon to estimates on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, allowing for a range of powers of natural (Laplacian and wave) Fourier multiplier operators. A key difference in these curved space estimates as compared to the flat case is a loss of an arbitrarily small amount of differentiability, attributable to a lack of dispersion of linear waves on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This arises in Fourier space from the product structure of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We further show that our estimates imply weighted estimates for the null form on Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Mass and radius of the most massive neutron star: The probe of the equation of state and perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, an association of GW190425 and FRB 20190425A had been claimed and a highly magnetized neutron star (NS) remnant was speculated. Given the $\sim 2.5$-h delay of the occurrence of FRB 20190425A, a uniformly rotating supramassive magnetar is favored since the differential rotation would have been promptly terminated by the magnetic braking. The required maximum gravitational mass ($M_{\rm TOV}$) of the nonrotating NS is $\approx 2.77M_\odot$, which is strongly in tension with the relatively low $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.25M_\odot$ obtained in current equation of state (EOS) constraints incorporating perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) information. However, the current mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability measurements of NSs alone do not convincingly exclude the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ possibility. By performing EOS constraints with mock measurements, we find that with a $2\%$ determination for the radius of PSR J0740+6620-like NS it is possible to distinguish between the low and high $M_{\rm TOV}$ scenarios. We further explore the prospect to resolve the issue of the appropriate density to impose the pQCD constraints with future massive NS observations or determinations of $M_{\rm TOV}$ and/or $R_{\rm TOV}$. It turns out that measuring the radius of a PSR J0740+6620-like NS is insufficient to probe the EOSs around 5 nuclear saturation density, where the information from pQCD becomes relevant. The additional precise $M_{\rm TOV}$ measurements anyhow could provide insights into the EOS at such a density. Indeed, supposing the central engine of GRB 170817A is a black hole formed via the collapse of a supramassive NS, the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.2M_\odot$ considerably softens the EOS at the center of the most massive NS, which is in favor of imposing the pQCD constraint at density beyond the one achievable in the NSs.</description>

      <title>Searching for discrete series representations at the late-time boundary of de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group $SO(d+1,1)$ makes an appearance both as the conformal group of Euclidean space in $d$ dimensions and as the isometry group of de Sitter spacetime in $d+1$ dimensions. While this common feature can be taken as a hint towards holography on de Sitter space, understanding the representation theory has importance for cosmological applications where de Sitter spacetime is relevant. Among the categories of $SO(d+1,1)$ unitary irreducible representations, discrete series is important in physical applications because they are expected to capture gauge fields. However, they are also the most difficult ones to recognize in field theoretical examples compared to representations from the other categories. Here we point towards some examples where we are able to recognize discrete series representations from fields on de Sitter and highlight some of the properties of these representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we review the classical covariant formulation of Yang-Mills theory and general relativity in the presence of spacetime boundaries, focusing mainly on the derivation of the presymplectic forms and their properties. We further revisit the introduction of the edge modes and the conditions which justify them, in the context where only field-independent gauge transformations are considered. We particularly show that the presence of edge modes is not justified by gauge invariance of the presymplectic form, but rather by the condition that the presymplectic form is degenerate on the initial field space, which allows to relate this presymplectic form to the symplectic form on the gauge reduced field space via pullback.</description>

      <title>Finding origins of CMB anomalies in the inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Pauli-Villars regularization of Kaluza-Klein Casimir energy with Lorentz symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

      <title>Relativity of the event: examples in JT gravity and linearized GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, "quasi-local" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of the Standard-Model Higgs: Electroweak Vacuum Stability during Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum stability of the non-minimally coupled Standard-Model Higgs during a phase of kinetic domination following the end of inflation. The non-minimal coupling to curvature stabilises the Higgs fluctuations during inflation while driving them towards the instability scale during kination, when they can classically overcome the potential barrier separating the false electroweak vacuum from the true one at super-Planckian field values. Avoiding the instability of the Standard-Model vacuum sets an upper bound on the inflationary scale that depends both on the strength of the non-minimal interaction and on the top quark Yukawa coupling. Classical vacuum stability is guaranteed if the gravitationally-produced energy density is smaller than the height of barrier in the effective potential. Interestingly enough, thanks to the explosive particle production in the tachyonic phase, the Higgs itself can be also appointed to the role of reheaton field responsible for the onset of the hot Big Bang era, setting an additional lower bound on the inflationary scale $\mathcal{H}_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 10^{5.5} \text{ GeV}$. Overall, these constraints favour lower masses for the top quark, in agreement with the current measurements of the top quark pole mass. We perform our analysis semi-analytically in terms of the one-loop and three-loop running of the Standard-Model Higgs self-coupling and make use of lattice-based parametric formulas for studying the (re)heating phase derived in arXiv:2307.03774. For a specific choice of $m_t=171.3 \text{ GeV}$ we perform also an extensive numerical scanning of the parameter space via classical lattice simulations, identifying stable/unstable regions and supporting the previous analytical arguments. For this fiducial value, the heating of the Universe is achieved at temperatures in the range $10^{-2} - 10^9 \text{ GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Solution Generation of a Capped Black Hole</title>

Abstract: Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation developed in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat, stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC) having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2 ]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent. Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>Metrizability of SO(3)-invariant connections: Riemann versus Finsler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a torsion-free affine connection on a given manifold, which does not necessarily arise as the Levi-Civita connection of any pseudo-Riemannian metric, it is still possible that it corresponds in a canonical way to a Finsler structure; this property is known as Finsler (or Berwald-Finsler) metrizability. In the present paper, we clarify, for 4-dimensional SO(3)-invariant, Berwald-Finsler metrizable connections, the issue of the existence of an affinely equivalent pseudo-Riemannian structure. In particular, we find all classes of SO(3)-invariant connections which are not Levi-Civita connections for any pseudo-Riemannian metric - hence, are non-metric in a conventional way - but can still be metrized by SO(3)-invariant Finsler functions. The implications for physics, together with some examples are briefly discussed.</description>
