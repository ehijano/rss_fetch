      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>

      <title>A Derivative Pricing Perspective on Liquidity Tokens in Constant Product Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized finance, any individual can pool their assets into an automated market maker (AMM) -- herein we focus on the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- in exchange for a claim on a fraction of future pool assets and fees earned from the market making operations. This position is represented by a liquidity token, whose prevailing on-chain price is effectively the initial deposited assets. Though this price is well-defined, we treat the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM in order to deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result. Adopting this perspective, in a frictionless environment, hedging the CPMM liquidity token under fair valuation should produce a riskless process, which therefore grows at the risk-free rate, something that is not seen in empirical case studies under the prevailing price. With our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) valuation which is consistent with the (near-continuous) replication strategy out-of-sample. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM design considerations motivated by this derivative-pricing perspective.</description>
