      <title>Matching Design with Sufficiency and Applications to Child Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many local foster care systems across the United States, child welfare practitioners struggle to effectively match children in need of a home to foster families. We tackle this problem while navigating a key sensitivity in this domain: in foster care systems, individual caseworkers must assent to any proposed matching. We codify this constraint in one-sided matching markets as the problem of matching design with sufficiency. We design a mechanism that guarantees outcome sufficiency, a form of welfare-maximizing Pareto efficiency ensuring that no caseworker can ex-post gain from any child-family placement reassignment and that the foster care authority's objective preferences for child-family placements are maximally satisfied. Our work subsequently evaluates this mechanism's strategic properties. Finally, we plan to conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to elicit real-world caseworkers' preferences and estimate the child welfare gains our algorithm produces. Current simulation-based results show dramatic improvements to welfare. Designing sufficient matching systems is an example of mechanism-reform because replacing existing systems without regard for existing agents' preferences and wishes has previously resulted in failure.</description>

      <title>Revealed Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analyst observes the frequency with which a decision maker (DM) takes actions, but does not observe the frequency of actions conditional on the payoff-relevant state. We ask when can the analyst rationalize the DM's choices as if the DM first learns something about the state before taking action. We provide a support function characterization of the triples of utility functions, prior beliefs, and (marginal) distributions over actions such that the DM's action distribution is consistent with information given the agent's prior and utility function. Assumptions on the cardinality of the state space and the utility function allow us to refine this characterization, obtaining a sharp system of finitely many inequalities the utility function, prior, and action distribution must satisfy. We apply our characterization to study comparative statics and ring-network games, and to identify conditions under which a data set is consistent with a public information structure in first-order Bayesian persuasion games. We characterize the set of distributions over posterior beliefs that are consistent with the DM's choices. Assuming the first-order approach applies, we extend our results to settings with a continuum of actions and/or states.%</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness results for a mean-field game of optimal investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for a stochastic mean-field game of optimal investment. The analysis covers both finite and infinite time horizons, and the mean-field interaction of the representative company with a mass of identical and indistinguishable firms is modeled through the time-dependent price at which the produced good is sold. At equilibrium, this price is given in terms of a nonlinear function of the expected (optimally controlled) production capacity of the representative company at each time. The proof of the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium relies on a priori estimates and the study of nonlinear integral equations, but employs different techniques for the finite and infinite horizon cases. Additionally, we investigate the deterministic counterpart of the mean-field game under study.</description>
