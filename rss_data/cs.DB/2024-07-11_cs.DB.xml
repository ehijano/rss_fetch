      <title>Understanding the Semantic SQL Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays we observe an evolving landscape of data management and analytics, emphasising the significance of meticulous data management practices, semantic modelling, and bridging business-technical divides, to optimise data utilisation and enhance value from datasets in modern data environments. In this paper we introduce and explain the basic formalisation of the Semantic SQL Transducer, a well-founded but practical tool providing the materialised lossless conceptual view of an arbitrary relational source data, contributing to a knowledge-centric data stack.</description>

      <title>Instrumentation and Analysis of Native ML Pipelines via Logical Query Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used to automate impactful decisions, which leads to concerns regarding their correctness, reliability, and fairness. We envision highly-automated software platforms to assist data scientists with developing, validating, monitoring, and analysing their ML pipelines. In contrast to existing work, our key idea is to extract "logical query plans" from ML pipeline code relying on popular libraries. Based on these plans, we automatically infer pipeline semantics and instrument and rewrite the ML pipelines to enable diverse use cases without requiring data scientists to manually annotate or rewrite their code.
  First, we developed such an abstract ML pipeline representation together with machinery to extract it from Python code. Next, we used this representation to efficiently instrument static ML pipelines and apply provenance tracking, which enables lightweight screening for common data preparation issues. Finally, we built machinery to automatically rewrite ML pipelines to perform more advanced what-if analyses and proposed using multi-query optimisation for the resulting workloads. In future work, we aim to interactively assist data scientists as they work on their ML pipelines.</description>

      <title>Daisy: An integrated repeat protein curation service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tandem repeats in proteins identification, classification and curation is a complex process that requires manual processing from experts, processing power and time. There are recent and relevant advances applying machine learning for protein structure prediction and repeat classification that are useful for this process. However, no service contemplates required databases and software to supplement researching on repeat proteins. In this publication we present Daisy, an integrated repeat protein curation web service. This service can process Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the AlphaFold Database entries for tandem repeats identification. In addition, it uses an algorithm to search a sequence against a library of Pfam hidden Markov model (HMM). Repeat classifications are associated with the identified families through RepeatsDB. This prediction is considered for enhancing the ReUPred algorithm execution and hastening the repeat units identification process. The service can also operate every associated PDB and AlphaFold structure with a UniProt proteome registry. Availability: The Daisy web service is freely accessible at daisy.bioinformatica.org.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Routing for Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional spaces is a pivotal challenge in the field of machine learning. In recent years, graph-based methods have emerged as the superior approach to ANNS, establishing a new state of the art. Although various optimizations for graph-based ANNS have been introduced, they predominantly rely on heuristic methods that lack formal theoretical backing. This paper aims to enhance routing within graph-based ANNS by introducing a method that offers a probabilistic guarantee when exploring a node's neighbors in the graph. We formulate the problem as probabilistic routing and develop two baseline strategies by incorporating locality-sensitive techniques. Subsequently, we introduce PEOs, a novel approach that efficiently identifies which neighbors in the graph should be considered for exact distance calculation, thus significantly improving efficiency in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that equipping PEOs can increase throughput on commonly utilized graph indexes (HNSW and NSSG) by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5, and its efficiency consistently outperforms the leading-edge routing technique by 1.1 to 1.4 times.</description>
