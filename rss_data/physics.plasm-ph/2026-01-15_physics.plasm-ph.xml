      <title>Unperturbed-orbit integration and the 3D kinetic dispersion relation of the electron cyclotron drift instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency instabilities in crossed-field ($\bm E\times\bm B$) plasmas are widely implicated in anomalous cross-field electron transport in Hall thrusters and related devices. Building on the fully kinetic 3D electrostatic dispersion relations reported by Ducrocq \emph{et al.} and later by Lafleur \emph{et al.}, we provide a concise, self-contained derivation of the key missing step: the magnetized-electron density perturbation $n_{e1}$ obtained from the linearized Vlasov equation via a retarded integration along unperturbed orbits, including finite-Larmor-radius effects and cyclotron harmonics. We collect the required mathematical identities in appendices and clarify the mapping between the Ducrocq Poisson-form and the Lafleur dielectric-form representations, including ion closures (cold-fluid versus kinetic Landau response). We conclude with a brief discussion of the assumptions and possible extensions toward more realistic configurations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of wave processes using beam-driven Langmuir/$\mathcal{Z}$-mode waveforms generated in Particle-In-Cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Type III solar radio bursts, beam-driven upper-hybrid wave turbulence is converted into electromagnetic emissions at the fundamental plasma frequency and its harmonic, through a chain of various linear and nonlinear wave processes. In this work, we mainly investigate the relative roles and interplay of two key mechanisms: the nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\mathcal Z$-mode waves and their linear transformations on random density fluctuations and, in particular, their mode conversion at constant frequency into electromagnetic waves. Using two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations, we employ a diagnostic approach based on large ensembles of virtual satellites that record local waveforms, enabling detailed temporal and spatial characterization of wave processes in randomly inhomogeneous plasmas. This method allows robust statistical analysis and direct comparison with spacecraft observations. The study focuses on the dependence of wave dynamics on the average level of density fluctuations and the plasma magnetization. Our results quantify the occurrence rate of decay under varying physical conditions and demonstrate how developed plasma density turbulence can significantly alter the balance between nonlinear wave-wave interactions and linear wave transformations. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for electromagnetic emissions during type III radio bursts and strengthen the connection between numerical simulations and in situ solar wind measurements, offering a valuable framework for the interpretation of future space-based waveform observations.</description>

      <title>Plasma wakes driven by Compton scattering: Non-linear regime and particle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate plasma wake generation via Compton scattering from photon bursts, a non-ponderomotive process relevant when the photon wavelength is smaller than the interparticle distance but larger than the Compton wavelength. In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <title>Comparison of plasma response models for RMP effects on the divertor and scrape-off layer in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) are beneficial for control of edge localized modes (ELMs) in tokamaks. Nevertheless, a side effect is the appearance of a helical striations in the particle and heat loads onto divertor targets. The extent and field line connection of these striations is significantly altered by the plasma response to external perturbations. For an ELM suppressed H-mode plasma at KSTAR, magnetic footprints are computed by FLARE based on plasma response from GPEC, MARS-F, M3D-C1 and JOREK with substantial differences in the resulting footprints (from 2 cm to 14 cm). This is reflected in EMC3-EIRENE simulations of the resulting heat loads: it is found that either the peak value or the extent of the striations appear to be overestimated compared to IRTV measurements. Reasonable agreement can only be achieved for the smallest footprint for lower input power and lower cross-field transport, or for higher upstream density and radiative power losses.</description>

      <title>Transient fields in oblique scattering from an infinite planar dielectric interface -- a qubit lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of the conservation of the magnetic moment and the longitudinal invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic invariants are fundamental to plasma physics but are often treated as purely theoretical concepts in undergraduate courses due to the difficulty of experimentally demonstrating them. This paper presents a pedagogical experiment to visualize and quantitatively verify the conservation of the magnetic moment ($\mu$) and the longitudinal invariant ($J$) using a standard educational electron charge-to-mass ratio apparatus configured as a magnetic bottle. By analyzing long-exposure photographs of the electron beam trajectory, we reconstructed the helical motion and calculated the invariants under different magnetic field configurations. Our results verify the conservation of the longitudinal invariant ($J$) with a ratio of 0.98 between configurations. The magnetic moment ($\mu$) exhibited a coefficient of variation of approximately 7\%, a deviation consistent with the presence of collisional effects in the tube. These findings demonstrate that complex plasma dynamics can be effectively studied using accessible laboratory equipment, providing a valuable bridge between theory and experiment for physics students.</description>

      <title>Breakeven in Nuclear Fusion via Electron-Free Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion promises a nearly limitless energy source, but achieving breakeven-where fusion output exceeds input-requires extreme plasma conditions and complex confinement systems. Here we propose an alternative approach based on beam-target interactions, introducing a simple energy-based criterion that compares fusion energy generation with energy loss. By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence for the Breakdown of Uniform-Electron-Gas Models in Warm Dense Aluminium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robust diagnosis of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense matter experiments remains a central challenge. We report angle-resolved femtosecond x-ray Thomson scattering measurements of shock-compressed aluminum at approximately 50 GPa over a wide range of scattering wavevectors at the European XFEL. The measured plasmon dispersion and line shape demonstrate that the standard analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering spectra based on uniform electron gas models systematically overestimates the plasmon resonance energy by up to 8 eV. In contrast, an analysis based on ab initio calculations reproduces both the dispersion and spectral shape within experimental uncertainty. Our results show that shock-induced disorder plays a critical role in the interpretation of x-ray Thomson scattering from compressed solids and provide direct evidence that ab initio approaches are required for reliable inference of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense aluminum.</description>

      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, methods for the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of a Multicusp-Assisted Inductively-Coupled Radio-Frequency Plasma Source for Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
