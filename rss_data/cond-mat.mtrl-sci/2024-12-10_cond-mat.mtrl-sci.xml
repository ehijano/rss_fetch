      <title>The effect of cerium doping and rate of crystallization on the microstructure of the Al2O3/YAG eutectic composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eutectics of Sapphire/Yttrium-Aluminum garnet and Ce-doped Sapphire/Yttrium-Aluminum garnet (Ce up to 1 at.%) with a Chinese script microstructure were obtained by the method of horizontal directional crystallization in a carbon-containing reducing atmosphere based on argon gas. The effects of the pooling rate and Ce-dopant concentration on the microstructure of the eutectic were studied by the modified chord method. The deviation of the dependence of the characteristic eutectic distance on the pooling rate from the Jackson-Hunt model has been established. A change in the pathway for restructuring the structure of the doped eutectic at a certain critical pooling rate was revealed, which may indicate that the development of morphological instability of the crystallization front is carried out as a two-stage process. The conditions for obtaining doped eutectic of high homogeneity have been established. It was shown that increasing cerium ion concentration causes an increase in the structure parameters and its value deviation. Intensive formation of the third phase occurred when the limit of cerium ion concentration was exceeded.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of electronic and piezoelectric properties of Li-based Tin-halide perovskites from GGA and Meta-GGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide bandgap semiconductors (WBGs) are predicted to be the potential materials for energy generation and storing. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) that incorporates generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-generalized gradient approximation (mGGA) methods to explore the various properties of the LiSnCl3 and LiSnBr3 perovskites. The structural stabilities, charge transfer, electronic, optical, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties are studied. Herein, we report that these rarely studied materials are eco-friendly and look promising for optoelectronics and piezoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Modulation of electronic and piezoelectric properties of lead-free halide perovskites LiSnX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, and I) under applied pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb-based perovskites are considered to be the most efficient materials for energy harvest. However, real-time application is limited because of their toxicity. As a result, lead-free perovskites that offer similar advantages are potential alternatives. Here, we have chosen LiSnX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, and I) for further calculation and explore its possibilities for harvesting clean and green energy. Our objective is to examine strategies for optimizing the parameters that control the energy-harvesting capabilities, particularly the interplay between structural variations and electrical properties. The density functional theory (DFT) has been employed for the theoretical simulation. Within the DFT framework, we have studied the effect of applied pressure (0 to 20 GPa) and elemental substitution on their physical properties. We hereby report the variation of lattice parameters, elastic constants, band gaps, and piezoelectric constants. MD simulation with time steps of up to 5 ps was performed to verify structural stability at room temperature. We report the semi-conducting characteristic of LiSnX$_3$ and the high piezoelectric response up to 20.7 Cm2. The presence of high piezoelectric coefficients suggests that manipulation of the structure of LiSnX$_3$ may provide an alternative way to harvest energy through electromechanical processes.</description>

      <title>Exotic properties and manipulation in 2D semimetal Mn2B2(OH)2: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most functional materials possess one single outstanding property and are limited to be used for a particular purpose. Instead of integrating materials with different functions into one module, designing materials with controllable multi-functions is more promising for the electronic industry. In this study, we investigate an unexplored alpha-phase of two-dimensional (2D) Mn2B2(OH)2 theoretically. Eighteen distinct electrical polarizations, characterized by three different magnitudes and twelve different directions, are found in this phase. The switch of the electrical polarizations is also linked to an observed splitting of band structures between different spin states and the ferroelasticity of the system. The manipulation of these properties can be realized through controlling the alignment of Mn-OH-Mn chains. Additionally, the approximately honeycomb lattice for the atomic layer of boron indicate the potential superconductivity in the system. The diverse and tunable properties make the proposed material as an outstanding candidate for sensing applications at the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Strain-engineering spin-valley locking effect in altermagnetic monolayer with multipiezo properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) in condensed matter systems has attracted much attention due to the physical properties arising from the alternating spins in both real space and reciprocal space. In our work, we propose a stable monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO with altermagnetic ground state and a new type of spin-valley locking (SVL) effect. The monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO exhibits a mutipizeo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley effect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by the uniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) in the AM system. Moreover, the compressive uniaxial strain could induce the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system, where the chirality of the dissipationless topological edge states could be manipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological phase transitions could be realized via the piezovalley effect in the AM system. Furthermore, the AM quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) could be induced by the biaxial strain effect, which contributes the quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work reveals that strain-engineering technique could provide as an important method to tune the dissipationless edge states in monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO. By designing the SVL effect could emerge new physics in AM systems, such as AVHE, QAHE and QSHE.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic ellipsometry of CsPbCl${_3}$ perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing optoelectronic devices based on cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl${_3}$) perovskites requires accurate values of their optical constants. Unfortunately, experimental data for this material is very limited thus far. Therefore, here, we applied spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) to measure the complex optical constants of thermally evaporated CsPbCl${_3}$ thin films with different thicknesses on Si/SiO${_2}$ substrates. The data were corroborated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and absorption spectroscopy. An optical dispersion model was developed to derive the complex optical constants and film thicknesses. The Tauc-Lorentz model, in conjunction with two harmonic oscillators, was used to extract the required parameters. The extinction coefficient spectrum exhibited a sharp absorption edge at 411 nm, consistent with the absorption spectrum. In addition, the optical bandgap of the film was calculated from the absorption spectra and SE data. The experimental values agree well with the simulation results, with values of $\sim$ 2.99 eV for different film thicknesses. This work provides fundamental information for designing and modeling CsPbCl3-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in hydrogen production using sulfide-based photocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfide-based photocatalysts (PC) are promising materials for efficiently producing hydrogen (H2). This chapter aims to provide a detailed survey of the recent advancements in sulfide-based photocatalysts and emphasize their enhanced performance and pathways to efficient H2 production. A detailed summary has been given, including several metal sulfides, such as cadmium sulfide (CdS), zinc sulfide (ZnS), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), lead sulfide (PbS), nickel sulfides (NiS/NiS2), iron disulfide (FeS2), copper sulfides (CuS/Cu2S), cobalt sulfides (CoS/CoS2), tin disulfide (SnS2), indium sulfide (In2S3), bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnxCd1-xS), manganese cadmium sulfide (MnxCd1-xS), zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4), and cadmium indium sulfide (CdIn2S4). This chapter will focus on the latest advancements in metal-sulfide-based materials for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), taking its accelerated growth and excellent research into account. After briefly outlining the basic properties, the chapter will showcase the cutting-edge strategies and recent research progress, including the construction of heterojunctions, defect engineering, co-catalyst loading, elemental doping, and single-atom engineering, which improve the electronic structure and charge separation capabilities of metal sulfides for photocatalytic hydrogen production. A future perspective and outlook have been proposed, focusing on some key points and a standard protocol. With this knowledge, we hope sulfide-based photocatalysts can be modified and engineered to improve their efficiency and stability in future research.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast lattice and electron dynamics induced in a PbSe crystal by an intense terahertz pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the ultrafast optical response of a PbSe crystal to an intense picosecond terahertz pulse with a peak electric field strength of up to $\sim$ 500 kV/cm. The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.</description>

      <title>Angular Dependence of Four Mechanical Properties of Graphynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphyne is a porous two-dimensional carbon allotrope of graphene that possesses interesting physical properties, including non-null bandgap. It is composed of carbon hexagonal rings or carbon-carbon bonds connected by acetylenic chains. The diverse forms of these connections yield a variety of graphyne structures. In a previous study, we have obtained the elastic properties of seven distinct families of graphyne structures as a function of the number of acetylene chains, from 1 to 10. The Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear compressibility were predicted for the zigzag and armchair directions of all 70 graphyne structures. Here, we present some noteworthy findings regarding the angular dependence of these four elastic properties of asymmetric graphynes. Our results demonstrate that in a single structure, the minimum and maximum Young's modulus can vary by a factor of 10. Additionally, the directions of null linear compressibility in some asymmetric structures were determined.</description>

      <title>High-pressure synthesis of K_{4}N_{6} compound entirely composed of aromatic hexazine [N_{6}]^{4-} anion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of hexazine N_{6} ring is another milestone in nitrogen chemistry after that of aromatic [N_{5}]^{-} anion. However, due to the diversity of carried charges, realizing compounds entirely composed of aromatic hexazine N_{6} ring potentially with high-stability is a challenge. The first reported hexazine N_{6} ring is [N_{6}]^{2-} anion in K_{2}N_{6} [Nat. Chem. 14, 794 (2022)] that does not adhere to H\''uckel's rule, and subsequently, the aromatic hexazine [N_{6}]^{4-} anion mixed with [N_{5}]^{-} anion and N_{2} dimers is realized in the complex compound K_{9}N_{56} [Nat. Chem. 15, 641 (2023)], where 5.36\% of N atoms form aromatic N_{6} ring. Here, we theoretically predict that all N atoms form aromatic hexazine [N_{6}]^{4-} anion in K_{4}N_{6}, which becomes stable at 60 GPa and can stably exist up to 600 K at 0 GPa. Following this approach, based on the diamond anvil cell, K_{4}N_{6} composed of 100\% aromatic hexazine [N_{6}]^{4-} anion is synthesized at 45 GPa after laser-heating and identified by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Our results bring us closer to achieving aromatic N6 rings at ambient condition.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Decoupling Drives Gold-Assisted Exfoliation of Large-Area Monolayer 2D Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique, producing centimeter scale single crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS2 on Au as a model system, we employ ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer, is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. We establish the strain-induced decoupling effect as the primary mechanism of GAE, which could also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.</description>

      <title>ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb): New Mn-Based Two-Dimensional Magnetoplumbites with Geometric and Magnetic Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration was rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, we report the discovery, synthesis and characterization of the first Mn-based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb). The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling as well as multiple low-temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data did not show any prominent lambda-anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction implied the absence of long-range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks were observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering was seen in the neutron powder diffraction patterns of both compounds at low angles, and was analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short-range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as two-dimensional magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).</description>

      <title>Materials-Discovery Workflows Guided by Symbolic Regression: Identifying Acid-Stable Oxides for Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of active learning (AL) approaches to identify materials with desired properties relies on the knowledge of a few parameters describing the property. However, these parameters are unknown if the property is governed by a high intricacy of many atomistic processes. Here, we develop an AL workflow based on the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression approach. SISSO identifies the few, key parameters correlated with a given materials property via analytical expressions, out of many offered primary features. Crucially, we train ensembles of SISSO models in order to quantify mean predictions and their uncertainty, enabling the use of SISSO in AL. By combining bootstrap sampling to obtain training datasets with Monte-Carlo feature dropout, the high prediction errors observed by a single SISSO model are improved. Besides, the feature dropout procedure alleviates the overconfidence issues observed in the widely used bagging approach. We demonstrate the SISSO-guided AL workflow by identifying acid-stable oxides for water splitting using high-quality DFT-HSE06 calculations. From a pool of 1470 materials, 12 acid-stable materials are identified in only 30 AL iterations. The materials property maps provided by SISSO along with the uncertainty estimates reduce the risk of missing promising portions of the materials space that were overlooked in the initial, possibly biased dataset.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric interlayer exchange coupling spontaneously built in synthetic antiferromagnetic structure by film growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antisymmetric-type long-range exchange interaction between two ferromagnetic layers through a nonmagnetic layer, called antisymmetric interlayer exchange coupling (AIEC), has recently been discovered and attracted much attention. This paper reports that the AIEC is naturally built in synthetic antiferromagnets depending on the thin film growth condition. For the synthetic antiferromagnets consisting of Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt layers, two kinds of film growth parameters are examined: the effects of epitaxial growth and oblique incident of sputter-deposition. The present results indicate that the spatial fluctuations in thicknesses are one of the major sources inducing the AIEC while the epitaxial growth, which leads to the sharp interfaces and the uniformity in layer thicknesses, effectively suppresses the unexpected AIEC. In addition, the oblique sputter-deposition provides the large AIEC and the anisotropic distribution of AIEC direction in the case of textured films. The findings in this study provide key factors for designing the AIEC and is useful to develop emerging computing technologies with artificial three-dimensional topological magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>The re-entrant ferromagnetism due to symmetric exchange bias in two septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is a typical magnetic topological insulator with an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Here we prepared ultra-thin MBT films with controlled anti-site defects and observed rich doping-dependent magnetic behaviors. We find in one-septuple-layer MBT films a ferrimagnetic ground state and in two-septuple-layer ones a kind of re-entrant ferromagnetism (FM) that disappears with increased Bi-on-Mn doping in the FM Mn-layers. This re-entrant behavior is attributed to a kind of symmetric exchange-bias effect that arises in the presence of both AFM and FM sub-systems due to the introduction of high-dense Mn-on-Bi anti-site defects. Furthermore, all MBT films display spin-glass-like behaviors. Our work demonstrates rich magnetic behaviors originating from the competing magnetic interactions between Mn spins at different lattice positions in MBT.</description>

      <title>Resistance switch in ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet spin valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Robust magnetoelectric coupling in altermagnetic-ferroelectric type-III multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking spatial inversion symmetry) and magnetism (breaking time-reversal symmetry), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, we propose a novel class of type-III multiferroics, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first-principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180{\deg} reversal of magnetic spin. This strong magnetoelectric coupling is further supported by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with robust, symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling and providing a theoretical foundation for the design of next-generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. To date, existing research in literature has predominantly focused on the most stable 1H phase 2D MXs and their armchair edge NRs, since the zigzag edge NRs (ZNRs) of this phase show metallic behavior. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the localized state, the unpassivated case possesses a nearly flat top valence band. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods represent a powerful family of computational techniques for tackling complex quantum many-body problems and performing calculations of stationary state properties. QMC is among the most accurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its application is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely addressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step towards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation through stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the theoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a step-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified scenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are provided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial approach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems. In particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on the accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting two-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in principle, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by practical insights. By addressing the fundamental concepts from a hands-on perspective, we hope this tutorial will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and students approaching DMC for the first time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Spectrally Selective Near Infrared Photothermal Conversion in Plasmonic Nanohelices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photothermal conversion in plasmonic nanohelices, unveiling how helical nanostructures made from metals with a notable interband activity, such as cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), exhibit a remarkable temperature rise $\Delta$T up to $\approx$1000 K under illumination. Such outstanding $\Delta$T values exclusively occur at wavelengths close to their localised plasmon resonances ($\Delta$T is significantly lower off resonance), and therefore the photothermal conversion of these nanoparticles is spectrally selective. The exceptional and spectrally selective temperature rise is demonstrated at near infrared wavelengths, which prompts the use of Co and Ni helical nanoparticles in a wide range of photothermal applications including solar energy conversion, seawater desalination, catalysis, or nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Frontier orbitals control dynamical disorder in molecular semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transport in organic semiconductors is limited by dynamical disorder. Design rules for new high-mobility materials have therefore focused on limiting its two foundations: structural fluctuations and the transfer integral gradient. However, it has remained unclear how these goals should be translated into molecular structures. Here we show that a specific shape of the frontier orbital, with a lack of nodes along the long molecular axis, reduces the transfer integral gradient and therefore the dynamical disorder. We investigated single crystals of the prototypical molecular semiconductors pentacene and picene by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical disorder calculations. We found that picene exhibits a remarkably low dynamical disorder. By separating in- and out-of-plane components of dynamical disorder, we identify the reason as a reduced out-of-plane disorder from a small transfer integral derivative. Our results demonstrate that molecules with an armchair $\pi$-electron topology and same-phase frontier orbitals like picene are promising molecular building blocks for the next generation of organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in Ru$_2$TiSi full-Heusler compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heusler compounds with six valence electrons per atom have attracted interest as thermoelectric materials owing to their semimetallic and semiconducting properties. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate electronic transport in Ru$_2$TiSi-based full-Heuslers. We show that electronic transport in this system can be well captured by a two-parabolic band model. The larger band gap of Ru$_2$TiSi promises a higher thermoelectric performance, compared to its isovalent family member Fe$_2$VAl, which has been studied as a thermoelectric material for over two decades. Additionally, we identify $p$-type Ru$_2$TiSi as far more efficient than previously studied $n$-type compounds and demonstrate that this can be traced back to much lighter and more mobile holes originating from dispersive valence bands. Our findings demonstrate that an exceptionally high dimensionless figure of merit $zT &gt; 1$ can be realized in these $p$-type compounds around 700 K upon proper reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity, e.g., by substituting Zr or Hf for Ti.</description>

      <title>Reduction in Thermal Conductivity of Monolayer MoS2 by Large Mechanical Strains for Efficient Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) have received extensive research interests and investigations in the past decade. In this research, we report the first experimental measurement of the in plane thermal conductivity of MoS2 monolayer under a large mechanical strain using optothermal Raman technique. This measurement technique is direct without additional processing to the material, and MoS2's absorption coefficient is discovered during the measurement process to further increase this technique's precision. Tunable uniaxial tensile strains are applied on the MoS2 monolayer by stretching a flexible substrate it sits on. Experimental results demonstrate that, the thermal conductivity is substantially suppressed by tensile strains: under the tensile strain of 6.3%, the thermal conductivity of the MoS2 monolayer drops approximately by 62%. A serious of thermal transport properties at a group of mechanical strains are also reported, presenting a strain dependent trend. It is the first and original study of 2D materials' thermal transport properties under a large mechanical strain, and provides important information that the thermal transport of MoS2 will significantly decrease at a large mechanical strain. This finding provides the key information for flexible and wearable electronics thermal management and designs.</description>

      <title>Layer Dependent Thermal Transport Properties of One- to Three-Layer Magnetic Fe:MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-Dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been the subject of extensive attention thanks to their unique properties and atomically thin structure. Because of its unprecedented room-temperature magnetic properties, iron-doped MoS2 (Fe:MoS2) is considered the next-generation quantum and magnetic material. It is essential to understand Fe:MoS2's thermal behavior since temperature and thermal load/activation are crucial for their magnetic properties and the current nano and quantum devices have been severely limited by thermal management. In this work, Fe:MoS2 is synthesized by doping Fe atoms into MoS2 using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis and a refined version of opto-thermal Raman technique is used to study the thermal transport properties of Fe:MoS2 in the forms of single (1L), bilayer (2L), and tri-layer (3L). In the Opto-thermal Raman technique, a laser is focused on the center of a thin film and used to measure the peak position of a Raman-active mode. The lateral thermal conductivity of 1-3L of Fe:MoS2 and the interfacial thermal conductance between Fe:MoS2 and the substrate were obtained by analyzing the temperature-dependent and power-dependent Raman measurement, laser power absorption coefficient, and laser spot sizes. We also characterized Fe:MoS2's thermal transport at high temperature, and calculated Fe:MoS2's thermal transport by density theory function. These findings will shed light on the thermal management and thermoelectric designs for Fe:MoS2 based nano and quantum electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of post-eutectic composition at a fixed undercooling is introduced as the most probable composition in zones of coupled growth. This composition corresponds to the minimum Gibbs free energy release rate in the steady state regime, aligning with Prigogine principle of minimum entropy production for steady states. Geometrically, this is represented by the parallel tangents rule, a generalization of the common tangent rule for transitioning from equilibrium to steady state conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of calcium oxide (\ce{CaO}) under high temperature and pressure conditions is critical for understanding the physics of planetary interiors. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including both classical and ab-initio approaches, to investigate the melting behavior of CaO. We calculate the melting temperature of \ce{CaO} by the void-nucleated melting and two-phase coexistence techniques, aiming to resolve discrepancies in experimental data on the melting point, which range from 2843~K to 3223~K in different studies due to the high reactivity and vapor pressure of the substance. The obtained results are $T_f = 3066\pm12$~K and $T_f = 2940\pm65$~K using the void-nucleated melting and the two-phase coexistence method, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the enthalpy of fusion and the high-pressure melting curve, for the first time without making any assumption on the Clapeyron slope. This is extremely important since in experiments the Claperyon slope of the melting curve is estimated from low pressure measurements and the overheating ratio (i.e. $\eta=\frac{T_s}{T_f}-1$, where $T_s$ represents the thermal instability limit corresponding to the homogeneous melting temperature of the solid) is often assumed to be constant in simulations. Our MD results show that $T_s$ increases more rapidly with pressure than $T_f$ and thus that the overheating ratio sensibly depends upon pressure. These findings contribute to the accurate modeling of the CaO phase diagram, which is essential for geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Monoclinic Dead Layers in Ferroelectric $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ With Metal Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze dead layer comprising non-polar monoclinic (m) phase in $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ (HZO)-based ferroelectric (FE) material using first principles analysis. We show that with widely used tungsten (W) metal electrode, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancy across the cross-section plays a key role in dictating the favorability of m- phase formation at the metal-HfO2 interface. The energetics are also impacted by the polarization direction as well as the depth of oxygen vacancy, i.e., position along the thickness. At the metal - $HfO_2$ interface, when polarization points towards the metal and vacancy forms at trigonally bonded O atomic site, both interfacial relaxation and m- phase formation can lead to dead layers. For vacancies at other oxygen atomic sites and polarization direction, dead layer is formed due to sole interfacial relaxation with polar phase. We also establish the relative favorability of the m-phase dead layer for different Zr concentrations (x=1 and x = 0.5) and metal electrodes. According to our analysis, 50% Zr doped $HfO_2$ exhibits less probability of m-phase dead layer formation compared to pure $HfO_2$. Moreover, with electrodes consisting of noble metal (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Rh), m-phase dead layer formation is less likely. Therefore, for these metals, dead layer forms mainly due to the interfacial relaxation with polar phase.</description>

Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</description>

      <title>Local Magnetoelectric Effects as a Predictor of Surface Magnetic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use symmetry analysis and density functional theory to show that changes in magnetic order at a surface with respect to magnetic order in the bulk can be generically determined by considering local magnetoelectric responses of the crystal. Specifically, analysis of the atomic-site magnetoelectric responses, or equivalently the corresponding local magnetic multipoles, can be used to predict all surface magnetic modifications arising purely from symmetry lowering via termination of the bulk magnetic order. This analysis applies even in materials with no bulk magnetoelectric response or surface magnetization. We then demonstrate our arguments for two example antiferromagnets, metallic $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$ and rock-salt $\mathrm{NiO}$. We find that the $(010)$ and $(1\bar{1}0)$ surfaces of $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$ and $\mathrm{NiO}$ respectively exhibit a series of antiferroically, as well as roughness-sensitive, ferroically ordered, modifications of the surface magnetic dipole moments, via canting or changes in sublattice magnitude, consistent with the bulk ordering of the magnetic multipoles. Our findings demonstrate a universal bulk-boundary correspondance allowing the general prediction of minimal possible surface and interface magnetic modifications, even in non-magnetoelectric materials. Furthermore, it paves the way for more accurate interpretations of a wide variety of surface-sensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Automated Dynamic Image Analysis for Particle Size and Shape Classification in Three Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OCULAR, an innovative hardware and software solution for three-dimensional dynamic image analysis of fine particles. Current state-of-the art instruments for dynamic image analysis are largely limited to two-dimensional imaging. However, extensive literature has demonstrated that relying on a single two-dimensional projection for particle characterisation can lead to inaccuracies in many applications. Existing three-dimensional imaging technologies, such as computed tomography, laser scanning, and orthophotography, are limited to static objects. These methods are often not statistically representative and come with significant post-processing requirements, as well as the need for specialised imaging and computing resources. OCULAR addresses these challenges by providing a cost-effective solution for imaging continuous particle streams using a synchronised array of optical cameras. Particle shape characterisation is achieved through the reconstruction of their three-dimensional surfaces. This paper details the OCULAR methodology, evaluates its reproducibility, and compares its results against X-ray micro computed tomography, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable particle analysis.</description>

      <title>Impact of dynamic Jahn-Teller effect on magnetic excitations, lattice vibration, and thermal conductivity in UxTh1-xO2 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational and magnetic properties of single-crystal uranium-thorium dioxide (UxTh1-xO2) with a full range of 0&lt;x&lt;1 is investigated. Thorium dioxide is a diamagnet whose thermal properties are governed by lattice vibration. The addition of paramagnetic uranium ion leads to the emergence of magnetic effects that alter the thermophysical properties noticeably even at room temperature. The interaction of phonons with magnetic moments of uranium 5f electrons mediated by magnetoelastic coupling results in an anomalous low-temperature thermal conductivity profile. Analysis of the magnetic susceptibility measurements indicates a uranium-concentration-dependent reduction in effective magnetic moment previously associated with the dynamic Jahn-Teller (DJT) effect. The T2g Raman peak position follows a nonlinear trend as a function of uranium concentration and hints that these Raman active optical modes play a role in either DJT or mediating quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. A first principle-based thermal transport model is implemented to explain the low-temperature transport measurements, where the anomalous reduction is attributed to phonon-spin resonant scattering. The interplay between spins and phonons is also captured using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurements of phonon linewidths. Our results provide new insights into the phonon interactions with the magnetic excitations governing DJT effect and impacting the low-temperature thermal transport processes in this material system. These findings have implications for understanding low-temperature thermal transport and magnetic properties in advanced materials for information processing and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Dome-Shaped Superconducting Phase Diagram Linked to Charge Order in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge order is a central focus in condensed matter research, with kagome lattice systems offering unique insights. The kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($T_{\rm c}$ ${\simeq}$ 6.5 K) exhibits a hierarchy of charge order transitions: primary ($T_{\rm co,I}$ ${\simeq}$ 400 K), secondary ($T_{\rm co,II}$ ${\simeq}$ 80 K), and an additional transition at ($T^{*}$ $\simeq$ 35 K). The transitions at $T_{\rm co,II}$ and $T^{*}$ are linked to electronic and magnetic responses as revealed by muon-spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments. However, the connection between superconductivity, charge order, and electronic responses has remained elusive. By employing magnetotransport and X-ray diffraction techniques under pressures of up to 40 GPa, we observe that $T_{\rm c}$ rises to 9 K at 2 GPa, remains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa, resulting in a dome-shaped phase diagram. The resistivity anomaly at $T^{*}$ and magnetoresistance also exhibit a similar dome-shaped pressure dependence. Furthermore, we find that charge order transitions from long-range to short-range above 12 GPa, correlating with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$, suggesting superconductivity is closely tied to the charge-ordered state. Specifically, $T_{\rm c}$ peaks when charge order and the normal-state electronic responses are optimized. In contrast to systems like the cuprates, transition metal dichalcogenides, and other kagome materials, where superconductivity typically competes with charge order, LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ displays a pronounced interdependence between these two phenomena. This distinctive behavior sheds new light on the connection between superconductivity and charge order, offering avenues for theoretical advancements in understanding superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects in two-dimensional CrPS$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that domain walls built from bimeron chains (bc-DW) in two-dimensional systems constitute a spontaneously assembled medium that holds magnonic excitations along its direction. We prove that such magnons are topological, leading to protected edge states. We also verify the stability of the domain walls and its edge modes' resilience against disorder. Analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations support our findings. The robustness of these edge modes holds promise for potential applications in the design of nanoscale magnonic devices for information storage and transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electric Field Control of Magnetic Phase in Bilayer Magnets via interlayer hopping modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets present a promising platform for spintronic applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. The ability to electrostatically control their interlayer magnetic coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases is particularly advantageous for the development of energy-efficient spintronic components. While effective in bilayer CrI3, achieving this control in other 2D magnets remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 can achieve efficient electrostatic control through interlayer hopping modulation. We show that an external electric field can effectively manipulate the FM-AFM phase transition when interlayer hopping is enhanced by pressure or sliding. We further develop a four-site interlayer hopping model, revealing that the phase transition is driven by a combined effect of on-site energy splitting and interlayer electronic hopping. These findings pave the way for designing novel, electrically tunable spintronic devices, offering substantial potential for energy-efficient information processing and storage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fenton-like Photo-degradation and Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in Fe-doped Copper Oxide (CuO) Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of &gt;10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.</description>

Abstract: Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic simulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their promise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy surfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains computationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated to improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training methodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic forces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional first-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training. Our GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in the reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing direct force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data for ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for lithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve accuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced computational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both data efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous environments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and scalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the large-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployable structures, essential across various engineering applications ranging from umbrellas to satellites, are evolving to include soft, morphable designs where geometry drives transformation. However, a major challenge for soft materials lies in achieving reliable actuation and stable shape retention in their deployed state. Drawing inspiration from biological growth processes, we demonstrate that irreversible plastic deformations can be leveraged to create cellular metamaterials with permanent morphing capabilities. By employing a simple actuation method, stretching and releasing the structure's ends, our approach facilitates the design of structures capable of sequential, multi-target configurations and mechanical multistability. Our methodology augments additive manufacturing to transform flat, printable designs into intricate 3D forms, with broad applications in consumer goods, healthcare, and architecture.</description>

      <title>Microstructural evolution of Carrara marble during semi-brittle deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifteen marble samples were subjected to semi-brittle deformation through triaxial compression experiments, reaching axial strains of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0%, or 7.5% at temperatures of 20C, 200C, or 350C, under a confining pressure of 400 MPa. Deformation twins, lattice curvature, and intragranular microfractures in the samples were quantitatively characterised using forescattered electron images and electron backscatter diffraction. Microstructural analyses revealed that twins accommodate most of the shortening during the first 2% strain, whereas lattice curvature associated with geometrically necessary dislocations predominantly develops in the later stages. Intragranular fracture intensity exhibits an almost linear correlation with strain during the first 2% strain but increases more slowly thereafter. The mechanical data indicate a strong temperature dependence of yield stress, consistent with the temperature dependence of the critical resolved shear stress for dislocation glide. The subsequent strain hardening is likely caused by progressively increasing intensity of interactions among dislocations and between dislocations and twin boundaries. Based on the microstructural data and interpreted hardening mechanisms, we propose a phenomenological model, with microstructural state variables, for semi-brittle deformation at our experimental conditions as a step towards development of a microphysical constitutive model of semi-brittle deformation.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Stochastic Signal Manipulation in Superparamagnetic Tunnel Junctions via Voltage-Controlled Exchange Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) are emerging as promising components for stochastic units in neuromorphic computing, owing to their tunable random switching behavior. Conventional MTJ control methods, such as spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT), often require substantial power. Here, we introduce the voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) mechanism, enabling switching between antiparallel and parallel states in sMTJs with an ultralow power consumption of only 40 nW, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than conventional STT-based sMTJs. This mechanism yields a sigmoid-shaped output response, making it ideally suited for neuromorphic computing applications. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of integrating VCEC with the SOT current control, offering an additional dimension for magnetic state manipulation. This work marks the first practical demonstration of VCEC effect in sMTJs, highlighting its potential as a low-power control solution for probabilistic bits in advanced computing systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of repulsively bound magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable composite objects, such as hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and superconducting pairs, formed by attractive forces are ubiquitous in nature. By contrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long thought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally occurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong repulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical lattices. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed to have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we present spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and bound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. In large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify repulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy measurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain antiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model. Our experimental results show that these high-energy repulsively bound magnon states are well separated from continua, exhibit significant dynamical responses and, despite dissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified. As the transport properties in spin chains can be altered by magnon bound states, we envision such states could serve as resources for magnonics based quantum information processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Real-space study of zero-field correlation in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene (RG) has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Despite its potential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a detailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states. In this study, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe the intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a correlated insulating state with a 17 meV gap at the charge neutrality point in tetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer configuration. This gap is suppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge carrier density and does not exhibit inter-valley coherence patterns. We attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state, characterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and antiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic correlated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the correlated regime, a bound state emerges around a non-magnetic impurity but is absent near magnetic impurities, suggesting that non-magnetic doping induces a spin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated regime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of the band dispersion in tetralayer RG. These findings provide atomic-scale evidences of zero-field correlations in RG and may be extended to study other exotic phases in RG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice structures are increasingly used in various fields of application due to the steady growth of additive manufacturing technology. Depending on the type of lattice, these structures are more or less suitable for energy absorption due to the deformation of diagonal struts. The energy absorption properties depend significantly on the type of the selected lattice structure and its density, material properties, printing process, and post-treatment. Here, five lattice types (Octet, BFCC, Diamond, Truncated Octahedron and Rhombicuboctahedron) with different volume fractions are compared. Stereolithography is used to print the different lattices made from liquid resin. This allows good results to be achieved with tiny structures. In particular, the sustainability of energy-absorbing structures plays a significant role in many processes to withstand multiple loads. The lattice structures are made of TPU resin and offer different energy absorption properties without being destroyed under load. The structures are loaded abruptly using the Split-Hopkinson pressure bar test in a modified setup. From the measured strain pulses, we can calculate how much of the applied energy was absorbed by the different structures</description>

Abstract: We report on the successful design and fabrication of optical modules using a 50 micron pitch polymer waveguide interface, integrated for low loss, high density optical data transfer with very low space requirements on a Si photonics die. This prototype module meets JEDEC reliability standards and promises to increase the number of optical fibers that can be connected at the edge of a chip, a measure known as beachfront density, by six times compared to state of the art technology. Scalability of the polymer waveguide to less than 20 micron pitch stands to improve the bandwidth density upwards of 10 Tbps/mm.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Switching in Monolayer 2D Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors via Spin-to- Spin Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with topological insulators or heavy metals holds great potential for realizing next-generation spintronic memory devices. However, achieving high-efficiency SOT switching of monolayer vdW magnets at room temperature poses a significant challenge, particularly without an external magnetic field. Here, we show field-free, deterministic, and nonvolatile SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization in the monolayer, diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Fe-doped MoS2(Fe:MoS2) at up to 380 K with a current density of $7\times10^4 A cm^{-2}$. The in situ doping of Fe into monolayer MoS2 via chemical vapor deposition and the geometry-induced strain in the crystal break the rotational switching symmetry in Fe:MoS2, promoting field-free SOT switching by generating out-of-plane spins via spin-to-spin conversion. An apparent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) loop shift at a zero in-plane magnetic field verifies the existence of z spins in Fe:MoS2, inducing an antidamping-like torque that facilitates field-free SOT switching. A strong topological Hall effect (THE) was also observed, attributed to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), reducing the energy barrier for SOT switching. This field-free SOT application using a 2D ferromagnetic monolayer provides a new pathway for developing highly power-efficient spintronic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrowband infrared organic photodetectors are in great demand for sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy applications. However, most existing strategies for narrowband detection depend on spectral filtering either through saturable absorption, which requires active layers exceeding 500 nm, restricting the choice of materials for producing high-quality films, or cavity effects, which inherently introduce strong angular dispersion. Microcavity exciton-polariton (polariton) modes, which emerge from strong exciton-photon coupling, have recently been explored as an angular dispersion suppression strategy for organic optoelectronics. In this work, we present the first narrowband infrared polariton organic photodiode that combines angle-independent response with a record-high responsivity of 0.24 A/W at 965 nm and -2 V. This device, featuring a 100-nm-thin active layer comprising a non-fullerene acceptor, exhibits a detection mode with a full-width at half maximum of less than 30 nm and a marginal angular dispersion of under 15 nm across $\pm$$45^\circ$. This study highlights the potential of polaritons as an innovative platform for developing next-generation optoelectronic devices that achieve simultaneous enhancements in optical and electronic performance.</description>

Abstract: High spin Chern-number insulators (HSCI) have emerged as a novel 2D topological phase of condensed matter that is beyond the classification of topological quantum chemistry. In this work, we report the observation of a semimetallic Sb monolayer carrying the same band topology as HSCI with a spin Chern number equal to 2. Our calculations further indicate a moderate lattice strain can make Sb monolayer an insulator or a semimetal with a tunable spin Chern number from 0 to 3. The results suggest strained Sb monolayers as a promising platform for exploring exotic properties of the HSCI topological matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has seen promising developments in materials science, yet its efficacy largely depends on detailed crystal structural data, which are often complex and hard to obtain, limiting their applicability in real-world material synthesis processes. An alternative, using compositional descriptors, offers a simpler approach by indicating the elemental ratios of compounds without detailed structural insights. However, accurately representing materials solely with compositional descriptors presents challenges due to polymorphism, where a single composition can correspond to various structural arrangements, creating ambiguities in its representation. To this end, we introduce PCRL, a novel approach that employs probabilistic modeling of composition to capture the diverse polymorphs from available structural information. Extensive evaluations on sixteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PCRL in learning compositional representation, and our analysis highlights its potential applicability of PCRL in material discovery. The source code for PCRL is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/PCRL.</description>

Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co magnetization, explaining our experimental results.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, the ideal shear strength ({\tau}_is) of dilute Ni34XZ ternary alloys (X or Z = Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti) are predicted by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in terms of pure alias shear deformations. The {\tau}_is results show that within the concentration up to 8.3% of alloying elements, {\tau}_is increases with composition in binary systems with Mn, Fe, and Co in ascending order, and decreases with composition with Nb, Si, Mo, Ti, Al, and Cr in descending order. The composition dependence of {\tau}_is in binary and ternary systems is modeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach considering lattice instability, indicating that atomic bonding strength significantly influences {\tau}_is. Correlational analyses further show that lattice constant and elastic constant C11 affect {\tau}_is, the most out of the elemental features.</description>

Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure - the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks - in the same way as it is done in X-ray analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials with stacked van der Waals (vdW) layers hosting non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Using high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). We show that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-atomic-layer slabs separated by two I layers can accommodate a variety of metal atoms giving arise to topologically non-trivial features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Overestimation of melting temperatures calculated by first-principles molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the melting temperature, $T_{m}$, of a solid can be calculated based on first-principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) simulations, systematic assessments of the accuracy of the resulting values have not yet been reported. FP-MD simulations require significant computational resources and hence an examination of the effect of cell size on convergence is difficult. In addition, calculation of the energy of a liquid is not a trivial problem because of energy dissipation effects. The present work attempts to resolve these problems, and thus allow the accuracy of $T_{m}$ values obtained from FP-MD simulations to be assessed for typical semiconductors, metals, and oxides. With the exception of Si, the $T_{m}$ value was overestimated in all cases. This overestimation can be reduced by increasing the cell size, although the convergence is slow unless the potential is very shallow. For oxides, this overestimation may not be removed by increasing the cell size. The LDA/GGA error of overbinding affects the melting enthalpy and thereby $T_{m}$. In order to fully capture the energy dissipation nature of liquids, adiabatic MD simulations are required, and such simulations have been performed in the present study.</description>

Abstract: Novel CaV1-xWxO3 (0.1 &lt; x &lt; 0.33) oxides with an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure of GdFeO3 type have been synthesized. These compounds contain in B-position W+6 and V cations in an oxidation state between +4 (CaVO3) and +3 (x=0.33). CaV0.9W0.1O3 compound possesses metallic type of conductivity and Pauli paramagnetism. The intermediate compositions are between bad metal and semiconducting type of behavior with paramagnetic response. CaV0.67W0.33O3 is a Mott insulator with localized V+3 moments coupled by strong antiferromagnetic interactions. It demonstrates the reduction of effective magnetic moment at high temperatures and canonical spin glass state formation with the freezing temperature Tg = 27.5 K seen in dc - and ac - magnetic susceptibility. Disorder in the magnetic subsystem induces a broad peak in magnetic contribution of the heat capacity at Tmax = 46 K.</description>

Abstract: Hidden spin polarization (HSP) with zero net spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization has been proposed in certain nonmagnetic centrosymmetric compounds, where the individual sectors forming the inversion partners are all inversion asymmetry. Here, we extend this idea to antiferromagnetic materials with $PT$ symmetry (the joint symmetry of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), producing zero net spin polarization in total, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses altermagnetism, giving rise to non-zero local spin polarization in the real space, dubbed "hidden altermagnetism". By first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ can serve as a possible candidate showing altermagnetic HSP. By applying an external electric field to break the global $P$ symmetry, the hidden altermagnetism can be separated and observed experimentally. Our works extend the hidden physics, and will also advance the theoretical and experimental search for new type of spin-polarized materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer a pathway for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can potentially be used to create robust nano-oscillators. Here, we employed the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin-pumping FMR measurements to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films at temperatures ranging from 300K to 90K. We find that the bilayer system exhibits a low magnetic damping (0.002), small linewidth (12Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ( 3.2%) at 170K, making it the optimum working temperature for spin orbit torque oscillators based on this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate through first-principles calculations rutile CoF$_2$ as an altermagnetic material. It is confirmed that there are two antiparallel magnetic moments of Co ions in the unit cell and the magnetic easy axis is in the z axis. A giant nonrelativstic spin splitting is observed near the valence band edge (valence band maximum) and there are ideal flat bands at the valence band edge along the [110] directions in the Brillouin zone. The giant nonrelativstic spin splitting and the band-edge flat bands are both robust against the spin-orbits coupling. More importantly, these band-edge flat bands can induce two-dimensional hole gases in two different planes. Applying a magnetic field in the xy plane, there will appear Landau levels and quantum Hall effects can be achieved for both of the spin channels. When the magnetic field is along the diagonal directions, quantum Hall effects can be induced for one spin and there is a longitudinal conductivity for the other spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate Chern vector insulators and topological surface states in a three-dimensional lattice, based on phase-delayed temporal-periodic interactions within the tight-binding model. These Floquet interactions break time-reversal symmetry, effectively inducing a gauge field analogous to magnetic flux. This gauge field results in Chern numbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector. This vector characterizes the topological phases and signifies the emergence of robust surface states. Numerically, we observe these states propagating unidirectionally without backscattering on all open surfaces of the three-dimensional system. Our work paves the way for breaking time-reversal symmetry and realizing three-dimensional Chern vector topological insulators using temporal-periodic Floquet techniques.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic phases of electron-doped infinite-layer Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$CuO$_2$ are elucidated by first-principles density functional calculations. The antiferromagnetic parent state, metallic transition, as well as lattice evolution with doping and pressure are found to be consistent with experiments. The specific heat coefficient $\gamma$, magnetic exchange coupling $J$, as well as the density of states at Fermi level $N(0)$ of low-energy states with multiple magnetic configurations are investigated. We highlight a subset of such states in which we note an increase in $N(0)$ to suggest the interesting effects of magnetic fluctuations and La substitution on the electronic structure of this material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nonlinear current response has been theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed recently. However, the role of disorder scattering in the response, especially whether it contributes to the $\sigma_{xx}$-independent term, has not been clarified. In this work, we derive a general scaling law for this effect, which accounts for multiple scattering sources. We show that the nonlinear conductivity is generally a quartic function in $\sigma_{xx}$. Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic contributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their values can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one. Terms beyond zeroth order are all extrinsic. Cubic and quartic terms must involve skew scattering and they signal competition between at least two scattering sources. The behavior of zeroth order extrinsic terms is explicitly demonstrated in a Dirac model. Our finding reveals the significant role of disorder scattering in $\mathcal{T}$-odd nonlinear transport, and establishes a foundation for analyzing experimental result.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising route to achieving large-scale quantum computers. A key challenge in realising large-scale superconducting quantum processors involves mitigating frequency collisions. In this paper, we present an approach to tuning fixed-frequency qubits with the use of an electron beam to locally anneal the Josephson junction. We demonstrate the ability to both increase and decrease the junction barrier resistance. The technique shows an improvement in wafer scale frequency targetting by assessing the frequency collisions in our qubit architecture. Coherence measurements are also done to evaluate the performance before and after tuning. The tuning process utilises a standard electron beam lithography system, ensuring reproducibility and implementation by any group capable of fabricating these Josephson junctions. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computing systems, thereby paving the way for the future of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse. The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin friction and dissipative spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Weakly Confined CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization could significantly advance ultrafast time-of-flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, we demonstrate that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. We show that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non-radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420 ps lifetime and light yield of ~10'000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non-radiative losses. Temperature-dependent light-guiding experiments on test-bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light-transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band-edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotech scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.</description>
