      <title>Reversibility of rings with respect to the Zhou Radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with identity and $\delta(R)$ denote the Zhou radical of $R$. A ring $R$ is called {\it $\delta$-reversible} if for any $a$, $b \in R$, $ab = 0$ implies $ba \in \delta(R)$. In this paper, we give some properties of $\delta$-reversible rings. We examine some extensions of $\delta$-reversible rings.</description>

      <title>Group-Graded Twisted Calabi-Yau Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, the study of graded (twisted or otherwise) Calabi-Yau algebras has meant the study of such algebras under an $\mathbb{N}$-grading. In this paper, we propose a suitable definition for a twisted $G$-graded Calabi-Yau algebra, for $G$ an arbitrary abelian group. Building on the work of Reyes and Rogalski, we show that a $G$-graded algebra is twisted Calabi-Yau if and only if it is $G$-graded twisted Calabi-Yau. In the second half of the paper, we prove that localizations of twisted Calabi-Yau algebras at elements which form both left and right denominator sets remain twisted Calabi-Yau. As such, we obtain a large class of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded twisted Calabi-Yau algebras arising as localizations of Artin-Schelter regular algebras. Throughout the paper, we survey a number of concrete examples of $G$-graded twisted Calabi-Yau algebras, including the Weyl algebras, families of generalized Weyl algebras, and universal enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Infinitary primitive positive definability over the real numbers with convex relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a finite structure, the polymorphism invariant relations are exactly the primitively positively definable relations. On infinite structures, these two sets of relations are different in general. Infinitary primitively positively definable relations are a natural intermediate concept which extends primitive positive definability by infinite conjunctions.
  We consider for every convex set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the structure of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ with addition, scalar multiplication, constants, and additionally the relation $S$. We prove that depending on $S$, the set of all relations with an infinitary primitive positive definition in this structure equals one out of six possible sets. This dependency gives a natural partition of the convex sets into six nonempty classes. We also give an elementary geometric description of the classes and a description in terms of linear maps.
  The classification also implies that there is no locally closed clone between the clone of affine combinations and the clone of convex combinations.</description>

      <title>A unifying construction of semifields of order $p^{2m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present two new constructions for semifields of order $p^{2m}$. Together, the constructions unify and generalize around a dozen distinct semifield constructions, including both the oldest known construction by Dickson and the largest known construction in odd characteristic by Taniguchi. The constructions also provably yield many new semifields. We give precise conditions when the new semifields we find are equivalent and count precisely how many new inequivalent semifields we construct.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of finite-dimensional diagonally graded commutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any finite-dimensional commutative (associative) graded algebra with all nonzero homogeneous subspaces one-dimensional is defined by a symmetric coefficient matrix. This algebraic structure gives a basic kind of $A$-graded algebras originally studied by Arnold. In this paper, we call them diagonally graded commutative algebras (DGCAs) and verify that the isomorphism classes of DGCAs of dimension $\leq 7$ over an arbitrary field are in bijection with the equivalence classes consisting of coefficient matrices with the same distribution of nonzero entries, while dramatically there may be infinitely many isomorphism classes of dimension $n$ corresponding to one equivalence class of coefficient matrices when $n\geq 8$.
  Furthermore, we adopt the Skjelbred-Sund method of central extensions to study the isomorphism classes of DGCAs, and associate any DGCA with a undirected simple graph to explicitly describe its corresponding second (graded) commutative cohomology group as an affine variety.</description>

      <title>Multicomplex Ideals, Modules and Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study some algebraic aspects of multicomplex numbers $\mathbb M_n$. For $n\geq 2$ a canonical representation is defined in terms of the multiplication of $n-1$ idempotent elements. This representation facilitates computations in this algebra and makes it possible to introduce a generalized conjugacy $\Lambda_n$, i.e. a composition of the $n$ multicomplex conjugates $\Lambda_n:=\dagger_1\cdots \dagger_n$, as well as a multicomplex norm. The multicomplex algebra equipped with this norm and $\Lambda_n$ as the involution forms a C$^*$-algebra. The ideals of the ring of multicomplex numbers are then studied in details. Free $\mathbb M_n$-modules and their linear operators are considered. Finally, we develop Hilbert spaces on the multicomplex algebra.</description>
