      <title>Unraveling the Origin of Unequal Mass Gravitational Wave Events: Insights from a Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.</description>

      <title>Precursors in tidal disruption events: repeating, fast, and AGN-hosted TDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Polar-Cap Currents in Multipolar Pulsar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray pulse-profile modeling of millisecond pulsars offers a direct route to measuring neutron star masses and radii, thereby constraining the dense-matter equation of state. However, standard analyses typically rely on \emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\Lambda$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\sim 30\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation.</description>

      <title>The Role of Faraday Rotation in the Polarization of the X-rays from Magnetically Powered Black Hole Coronas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the prime candidate mechanisms that may energize the plasma emitting the strongly polarized X-ray emission from black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in their hard states. The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Broadband Timing and Spectral Study of Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658 during Its 2022 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our investigation of the NuSTAR and AstroSat observations along with simultaneous NICER observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658, obtained during its tenth outburst from 2022. The NuSTAR observation captured the source near the outburst peak, while AstroSat observed it during the decay phase. Coherent pulsations at $\sim$401 Hz were detected throughout the outburst, with the fundamental amplitude in the 3--30 keV range increasing from $\sim$4% near the peak to $\sim$6% during the decay. The pulsations display strong energy dependence and negative time lags of $\sim$0.2--0.3 ms, with harder photons leading softer ones. The broadband spectra in both epochs are well described by a soft thermal component and Comptonized continuum, together with a prominent relativistic reflection component. As the outburst evolved, the continuum softened ($\Gamma$ increasing from $\sim$1.88 to $\sim$1.99) and the coronal electron temperature decreased ($kT_{\rm e}$ from $\sim$31 to $\sim$18 keV), consistent with enhanced Compton cooling at lower accretion rates. The ionization parameter declined ($\log \xi$ from $\sim$3.4 to $\sim$1.8) while the reflection fraction increased, suggesting a changing accretion geometry with a more compact corona and a larger disk covering fraction during the decay phase. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of $\sim$3 between the two epochs. Our results suggest the coupled evolution of the corona, disk, and magnetosphere as the mass accretion rate declines.</description>

      <title>Correlated and uncorrelated Monte Carlo neutron capture rate variations in weak $\textit{r}$-process simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of weak rapid neutron capture ($\textit{r}$-process) abundances require a systematic treatment of nuclear physics uncertainties, especially neutron capture rates far from stability. We employ new neutron capture rates from cross sections calculated with Yet Another Hauser-Feshbach Code ($\texttt{YAHFC}$) using an uncertainty-quantified Koning-Delaroche potential modified for use on neutron-rich systems. Using these rates as a baseline, we perform Monte-Carlo studies with independent rate variations (uncorrelated Monte Carlo) and find correlations between specific neutron capture rates and the resulting elemental abundances for the three weak r-process scenarios: two separate simulations of neutron star merger remnant accretion disks and a simulation of a magnetorotational supernova. We discuss the underlying nuclear dynamics that give rise to these correlations and the role of astrophysical conditions in them. We demonstrate how reducing the uncertainty in these rates would improve the prospects for conducting precision $\textit{r}$-process studies in the future. We additionally present a correlated Monte Carlo study, which incorporates the full covariance matrix that describes the relationships between individual neutron capture rates that arise from an uncertainty-quantified optical potential. We find that the magnitude of the uncertainty in the abundance pattern is similar to that produced by an uncorrelated Monte Carlo that employs only the on-diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We show how correlations restructure how the abundances co-vary, but do not necessarily decrease the overall uncertainty envelope.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Surfing Acceleration as a Coherent Mechanism for Electron Acceleration in Galaxy Cluster Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio relics in merging galaxy clusters are widely interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated at large-scale shocks. However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks.</description>

      <title>X-ray line diagnostics of the multi-phase gas in the Centaurus cluster core with XRISM/Resolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM, ~ 1.6 and ~ 3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.</description>

      <title>Constraints on GRB Jet Properties from IceCube Upper Limits: Insights from GRB 221009A and GRB 240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino telescope has provided upper limits on neutrino emission from gamma ray bursts. These constraints provided by the IceCube detector have been instrumental in investigating the properties of the GRB jet and its emission models. During the prompt phase of gamma ray burst emission, intense radiation components are generated that interact with the shock-accelerated particles within the jet. We study various GRB emission models, such as the internal shock model, the photospheric models, and also include a model-independent case. Based on these models, we calculate the neutrino fluence using the photo-hadronic interaction process. We estimate the bulk Lorentz factor using the well-known correlations between prompt phase observables, which is then used to calculate the emission site for the model-dependent scenarios. For GRB 221009A, we find that a low baryon loading scenario is consistent with the IceCube upper limits; however, for GRB 240825A, a higher value of baryon loading is preferred. Also, the values of the microphysical parameters $\epsilon_e$ and $\epsilon_B$ for GRB 240825A are lower by factors of approximately 10 and 100, respectively, compared to those of GRB 221009A. Further, using neutrino upper limits for these two sources, we estimate the lower limits on the dissipation radius for our models. The current TeV PeV upper limits for GRB 221009A are already useful for constraining parameter space for the BPH and MPH models.</description>

      <title>A nearby He-rich superluminous supernova at photospheric phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim. We present and interpret the data of the nearby hydrogen-deficient but helium-rich superluminous supernova SN~2021bnw which reached a magnitude of -20.7 at maximum luminosity in g band. Methods. We discuss the light curves and spectra of SN 2021bnw based on its spectro-photometric follow up exploiting different observational facilities. We reproduce the NIR spectrum of SN 2021bnw with TARDIS to inspect the chemical composition at late photospheric phases and identify helium features. We also use a STELLA model coupling hydrodynamics and radiation transport to constrain the physical parameters of the explosion assmunig a 56Ni+CSM scenario. Results. We suggest that SN 2021bnw was mainly powered by the interaction of the ejecta with a previously lost He-rich circumstellar material, coupled with a central power source. Conclusions. This work expands the data sample of He-rich superluminous supernovae rich (SLSNe Ib) and, assuming a single progenitor scenario, can constrain the masses and the physics of their progenitors.</description>

      <title>An updated constraint for the Gravitational Wave Background from the Gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi LAT observations of gamma-ray pulsars can be used to build a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment to search for gravitational wave (GW) signals at nanohertz frequencies. At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\approx2-3\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{GPUmonty}$: A GPU-accelerated relativistic Monte Carlo radiative transfer code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{GPUmonty}$, a CUDA/C-based Monte Carlo radiative transfer code accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs). $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ derives from the CPU-based code $\texttt{grmonty}$ and offloads the most computationally expensive stages of the calculation -- superphoton generation, sampling, tracking, and scattering -- to the GPU. Whereas $\texttt{grmonty}$ handles photons sequentially, $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ processes large numbers of superphotons concurrently, leveraging the single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model of modern GPUs. Benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of about $12\times$ relative to the original CPU implementation on a single GPU, with runtime limited primarily by register pressure rather than compute or memory bandwidth saturation. We validate the implementation through analytic tests for a optically thin synchrotron sphere, as well as comparisons with $\texttt{igrmonty}$ for scattering synchrotron sphere and GRMHD simulation data. Relative errors remain below a percent level and convergence is consistent with the expected $N_{\rm s}^{-1/2}$ Monte Carlo scaling. By significantly reducing computational costs, GPUmonty enables the extensive parameter space surveys and faster spectra modeling required to interpret horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes. $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ is publicly available under the GNU General Public License.</description>

      <title>Odd Radio Circles Modeled by Shock-Bubble Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.</description>

      <title>Dark matter effects on the properties of hybrid neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the properties of hybrid neutron stars, in particular the influence on the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass, and the hadron-quark phase transition. To single out the equilibrium configurations of dark-matter-admixed hybrid neutron stars (DHSs), we also study their radial oscillations. Both the stellar structure equations and the radial oscillation equations are solved for the two-fluid system, where the ordinary matter component and dark matter component couple only through gravity. For the ordinary matter components, we adopt the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method for nuclear matter, and the Dyson-Schwinger or the field-correlator model for quark matter. For the dark matter component, we use a non-self-annihilating self-interacting fermionic model. We find that the presence of dark matter in DHSs leads to a decrease of the critical mass of the hadron-quark phase transition, a related possible onset of quark matter in dark-matter accreting stars, and a significant reduction of radial oscillation frequencies.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration and hyperon suppression in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``hyperon puzzle'' remains a fundamental challenge in nuclear astrophysics. We investigate hyperon emergence in neutron star matter using the $SU(3)$ parity doublet model with chiral representation $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$. This framework naturally incorporates chiral symmetry restoration and provides a systematic description of baryon masses in dense matter through the interplay between the chiral condensate and the chiral invariant mass $m_0$. We find that the hyperon onset density exhibits strong sensitivity to $m_0$: for $m_0 = 500$ MeV, hyperons first appear at $1.9n_0$ while for $m_0 \gtrsim 750$ MeV, hyperons emerge only above $5n_0$. This delayed onset arises from the weakened density dependence of baryon masses at larger $m_0$ values. When the hyperon onset density exceeds the expected quark-hadron transition range ($2$--$5n_0$), matter undergoes deconfinement before hyperons populate, avoiding the EoS softening while maintaining consistency with massive neutron star observations. Our results demonstrate that chiral dynamics provides a natural resolution to the hyperon puzzle without requiring ad hoc repulsive hyperon interactions.</description>

      <title>CHIME/Slow overview and pilot survey: A new backend to search for second-duration radio transients with the CHIME telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of CHIME/Slow, a real-time transient search backend under development to search for second-duration radio transients using the CHIME telescope, and results obtained from a pilot survey carried out using the prototype version of the search pipeline. The prototype CHIME/Slow pipeline was tested on archival data obtained in December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023 with a total on-sky time of 17 days with an instantaneous Field of View (FoV) of $\sim$13 deg$^2$ . In this pilot survey, we detected nine bursts, one from a new non-repeating source and eight from the known hyperactive repeating source FRB 20220912A. Out of these nine bursts, two bursts from the repeater were not detected by CHIME/FRB, while the non-repeater was detected in the side-lobe of a beam in the CHIME/FRB exhibiting shorter pulse width and narrower bandwidth compared to the CHIME/Slow detection. Here we report properties of the bursts, discuss the sensitivity and completeness of the current version of the CHIME/Slow pipeline, and outline future development to improve its performance. Finally, based on these results, we report the all-sky rate (95% credible region) of radio transients with pulse widths between 16 ms to 5 s, fluence above 5 Jy ms and observing frequency of 600 MHz to be between 184 and 4556 bursts sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Hunter for Alerts (AHA): Anomaly Detection in the ZTF Transient Alert Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.</description>

      <title>Demographics of Wandering Black Holes Powering Off-Nuclear Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of three off-nuclear tidal disruption events (EP240222a, AT2024tvd, and AT2025abcr) - following the first such source, 3XMM J2150$-$05 - reveals a small but robust population of off-nuclear, or `wandering', black holes (WBHs) with masses $M_\bullet &gt; 10^4 M_\odot$. Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\star \sim 10^7 M_\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs, $\phi_{\rm WBH}(M_\star)$, finding that it peaks at $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)=11.10^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe reside in galaxies with $10.7 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.2$, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Presaging Doppler beaming discoveries of double white dwarfs during the Rubin LSST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double white dwarfs (DWDs) are by far the most common compact binaries in the Milky Way, are important low-frequency gravitational-wave sources, and in some cases merge to become Type Ia supernovae. So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright ($r \lesssim20~$mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P $\approx$ 10-600 minutes with moderate to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47 are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for DWDs in spectroscopic searches. The formation of unequal mass, short-period DWDs strongly depends on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during the LSST era.</description>

      <title>The disk precession in a Be star-magnetar binary and its application to the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how eccentric NSBHs form. Compact binaries that evolve in isolation radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. Here, we focus on a formation channel that efficiently produces NSBHs with both misaligned spins and significant eccentricity close to merger: isolated field triples. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, e_min,10, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, e_min,10 is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, e_min,10 = 0.003; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from binaries with $m_2=1.5$~M$_\odot$ and total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008 \leq$ e_min,10 $\leq 0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and e_min,10 is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, e_min,10 decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular aligned-spin templated search to NSBH mergers from field triples, finding that we recover only 46% of systems that would have been detected with a search containing the full physics of the injected population. Finally, we show that if $\sim\nicefrac{1}{3}$ of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then $\geq40\%$ are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cyclotron features and accretion regime in the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 from NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4U 1700-37 is a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary hosting a compact object, likely a neutron star, accreting from O6.5 Iaf+ supergiant HD 153919. Coherent pulsations not firmly detected; magnetic field strength remains uncertain. We analyze NuSTAR observations to characterize hard X-ray timing and spectral properties, test robustness of candidate cyclotron features, and constrain magnetic field and accretion regime. We perform timing and spectral analysis of two observations, modeling spectra with continua used for accreting pulsars, and use simulations to assess significance of features. No coherent pulsations detected; pulsed fraction constrained below 1.5\%. Spectra are well described by absorbed blackbody plus cutoff power-law continuum, showing residuals around 20 keV and 40--50 keV. Features improve fits but do not constitute firm cyclotron detections. Intensity-resolved spectroscopy suggests possible shifts of apparent line centroid. Results favor neutron-star magnetic field of 1.7--4.4 $\times 10^{12}$ G and quasi-spherical subsonic accretion regime with equilibrium spin period $\sim 1.9$ ks. Analysis provides quantitative constraints on magnetic field and accretion physics, helping reconcile discrepant line-energy measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present sensipy, an open-source Python toolkit for simulating observations of transient astrophysical sources, particularly in the high-energy (HE, keV-GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, GeV-TeV) gamma-ray ranges. The most explosive events in our universe are often short-lived, emitting the bulk of their energy in a relatively narrow time window. Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms. This information can further help to justify the feasibility of proposed observations, estimate detection rates (events/year) for various classes of sources, and provide scheduling insight in realtime during gamma-ray and multi-messenger observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>NuRadioMC: Simulating the radio emission of neutrinos from interaction to detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.01670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NuRadioMC is a Monte Carlo framework designed to simulate ultra-high energy neutrino detectors that rely on the radio detection method. This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed. Comprehensive examples are used to discuss the capabilities of the code and different aspects of instrumental design decisions.</description>

Abstract: If dark matter annihilates into standard model particles with a cross-section which is velocity dependent, then Local Group dwarf galaxies will not be the best place to search for the resulting gamma ray emission. A greater flux would be produced by more distant and massive halos, with larger velocity dispersions. We construct full-sky predictions for the gamma-ray emission from galaxy- and cluster-mass halos within $\sim 200 {\rm \, Mpc}$ using a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations ($\texttt{CSiBORG}$) based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Comparing to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and marginalising over reconstruction uncertainties and other astrophysical contributions to the flux, we obtain constraints on the cross-section which are two (seven) orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from dwarf spheroidals for $p$-wave ($d$-wave) annihilation. We find no evidence for either type of annihilation from dark matter particles with masses in the range $m_\chi = 2-500{\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, for any channel. As an example, for annihilations producing bottom quarks with $m_\chi = 10 {\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, we find $a_{1} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-21} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ and $a_{2} &lt; 3.0 \times 10^{-18} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ at 95% confidence, where the product of the cross-section, $\sigma$, and relative particle velocity, $v$, is given by $\sigma v = a_\ell (v/c)^{2\ell}$ and $\ell=1, 2$ for $p$-, $d$-wave annihilation, respectively. Our bounds, although failing to exclude the thermal relic cross-section for velocity-dependent annihilation channels, are among the tightest to date.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \&amp; Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.</description>

      <title>A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to semi-classical wormhole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>IK Pegasi and the Double-merger Path to Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Gaia astrometry has revealed thousands of main-sequence + white-dwarf binaries (MS+WD) at separations of ~0.1-10 au, including a subset hosting unusually massive (&gt;~0.8 Msun) WDs. We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (&gt;~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages toward eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.</description>
