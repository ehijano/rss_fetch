      <title>Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design.</description>

      <title>Building Confidence in Deep Generative Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models show promise for de novo protein design, but their effectiveness within specific protein families remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate two 3D rigid-body generative methods, score matching and flow matching, to generate monomeric protein backbones in SE(3) space. Our goal is to provide new insights and build confidence in the broader applicability of deep generative models for protein design. The optimal amino acid sequences were predicted from the generated backbones, followed by side-chain homology modeling. Results demonstrated high structural integrity, with conserved key residues aligning with known proteins. Structural phylogenetic analysis shows evolutionary links between the generated samples and their protein family members. Further molecular dynamics simulations and protein-ligand docking confirm the dynamic stability and functional potential of these samples, with ligand binding inducing conformational changes consistent with those in wild-type proteins.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Anaerobic Digestion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring adequate predictive power of computational models used in biology. Focusing on two anaerobic digestion models, this article introduces a novel generalized Bayesian procedure, called VarBUQ, ensuring a correct tradeoff between flexibility and computational cost. A benchmark against three existing methods (Fisher's information, bootstrapping and Beale's criteria) was conducted using synthetic data. This Bayesian procedure offered a good compromise between fitting ability and confidence estimation, while the other methods proved to be repeatedly overconfident. The method's performances notably benefitted from inductive bias brought by the prior distribution, although it requires careful construction. This article advocates for more systematic consideration of uncertainty for anaerobic digestion models and showcases a new, computationally efficient Bayesian method. To facilitate future implementations, a Python package called 'aduq' is made available.</description>

      <title>ProteinWeaver: A Divide-and-Assembly Approach for Protein Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature creates diverse proteins through a 'divide and assembly' strategy. Inspired by this idea, we introduce ProteinWeaver, a two-stage framework for protein backbone design. Our method first generates individual protein domains and then employs an SE(3) diffusion model to flexibly assemble these domains. A key challenge lies in the assembling step, given the complex and rugged nature of the inter-domain interaction landscape. To address this challenge, we employ preference alignment to discern complex relationships between structure and interaction landscapes through comparative analysis of generated samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ProteinWeaver: (1) generates high-quality, novel protein backbones through versatile domain assembly; (2) outperforms RFdiffusion, the current state-of-the-art in backbone design, by 13\% and 39\% for long-chain proteins; (3) shows the potential for cooperative function design through illustrative case studies. To sum up, by introducing a `divide-and-assembly' paradigm, ProteinWeaver advances protein engineering and opens new avenues for functional protein design.</description>
