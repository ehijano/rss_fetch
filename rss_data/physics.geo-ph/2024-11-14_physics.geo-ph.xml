      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Fluid Leakage and Fault Instability in Geologic CO2 Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geologic CO$_2$ storage is an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and mitigating climate change. In this process, coupling between mechanical deformation and fluid flow in fault zones is a key determinant of fault instability, induced seismicity, and CO$_2$ leakage. Using a recently developed methodology, PREDICT, we obtain probability distributions of the permeability tensor in faults from the stochastic placement of clay smears that accounts for geologic uncertainty. We build a comprehensive set of fault permeability scenarios from PREDICT and investigate the effects of uncertainties from the fault zone internal structure and composition on forecasts of CO$_2$ permanence and fault stability. To tackle the prohibitively expensive computational cost of the large number of simulations required to quantify uncertainty, we develop a deep-learning-based surrogate model capable of predicting flow migration, pressure buildup, and geomechanical responses in CO$_2$ storage operations. We also compare our probabilistic estimation of CO$_2$ leakage and fault instability with previous studies based on deterministic estimates of fault permeability. The results highlight the importance of including uncertainty and anisotropy in modeling of complex fault structures and improved management of geologic CO$_2$ storage projects.</description>

      <title>Description of a New Phenomenon of Atmospheric Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a newly hypothesized atmospheric phenomenon called toroh, inspired by the Brazilian regional phenomenon known as tromba de agua. The existence of the toroh, also suggested to be termed toroh, is characterized by intense and localized precipitation that causes water erosion, leaving straight scars on mountain slopes. The term originates from the Tupi-Guarani language meaning rainfall like a water jet. Guarani uses sounds to imitate natural phenomena, capturing distinct noises: one when water cuts through the air and another when it hits the ground. The toroh differs from cloudbursts and rainstorms, referring to other extreme precipitation events, as it is stronger and more localized. A conceptual model has been proposed, suggesting that a toroh occurs when a supercell passes over a rift, which intensifies the liquid micro-explosion and leads to the formation of a river within the atmosphere. Previously, meteorological observers in Southern Brazil used the term Tromba de agua for the same phenomenon. However, this term also referred to waterspouts in official Brazilian meteorology, leading to confusion.
  Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of indigenous contributions i
  n naming and understanding natural phenomena, which are often overlooked by Western science.</description>

      <title>Developing a Foundation Model for Predicting Material Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding material failure is critical for designing stronger and lighter structures by identifying weaknesses that could be mitigated. Existing full-physics numerical simulation techniques involve trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and the ability to handle complex features like varying boundary conditions, grid types, resolution, and physical models. We present the first foundation model specifically designed for predicting material failure, leveraging large-scale datasets and a high parameter count (up to 3B) to significantly improve the accuracy of failure predictions. In addition, a large language model provides rich context embeddings, enabling our model to make predictions across a diverse range of conditions. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are often tailored to specific systems or limited to narrow simulation conditions, our foundation model is designed to generalize across different materials and simulators. This flexibility enables the model to handle a range of material properties and conditions, providing accurate predictions without the need for retraining or adjustments for each specific case. Our model is capable of accommodating diverse input formats, such as images and varying simulation conditions, and producing a range of outputs, from simulation results to effective properties. It supports both Cartesian and unstructured grids, with design choices that allow for seamless updates and extensions as new data and requirements emerge. Our results show that increasing the scale of the model leads to significant performance gains (loss scales as $N^{-1.6}$, compared to language models which often scale as $N^{-0.5}$).</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of the fresh/saltwater interface with airborne electromagnetics: examining different sources of uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the distribution between fresh and saline groundwater is imperative for sustainable and integrated management of water resources in coastal areas. The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method is increasingly used for hydrogeological mapping over large areas via bulk electrical resistivity. However, accurately and reliably mapping the fresh/saltwater interface (FSI) requires accurate knowledge about the transition zone. The objective is to quantify the uncertainty in using AEM data to inform on the depth of the FSI. The study mimics a dual-moment time-domain SkyTEM sounding recorded in the Belgian coastal plain based on borehole data. It quantifies uncertainty using a differential evolution adaptive Metropolis algorithm to sample the posterior distribution. The results indicate the importance of reliable altitude, pitch and roll logging. Gathering prior knowledge about the transition zone, for example, through borehole logs, significantly improves the estimation of the FSI. The Resolve frequency-domain system, especially in context with very shallow to shallow FSIs, is more suitable for salinity mapping than the time-domain SkyTEM used in the field survey. The depth of the FSI may be defined via various threshold values. The uncertainty of three different thresholds is studied. The FSI based on the middle of the transition zone is the most reliable, while the FSI based on the 1500 mg/L total dissolved solids threshold is the least robust.</description>

      <title>Graph-GIC: A Smart and Parallelized Geomagnetically Induced Current Modelling Algorithm Based on Graph Theory for Space Weather Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric Earth models yield no net electron spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial experiments that use electrons in Earth as a spin-polarized source have been demonstrated to provide strong bounds on exotic long-range spin-spin and spin-velocity interactions. These bounds constrain the coupling strength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently, it was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the precession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net spin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth's perihelion precession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this monopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth's electrons. We find that there are about $6 \times 10^{41}$ spin-polarized electrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric Earth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to establish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth's rotation axis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth's spherical symmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we conclude that there are at least $5 \times 10^{38}$ spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth's rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth's perihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>On the Drag Coefficient Universality of a Rough Grain in Creeping Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controversy exists regarding whether grain morphology reduces or enhances the drag of a single grain in creeping flows; further complication occurs when orientation dependence for aspherical grains comes into play. To quantify influences of shape irregularity and orientation, this study numerically investigates the drag in creeping flows for fractally rough grains depicted by Spherical Harmonics. As the grain surface becomes more angular with increasing relative roughness and fractal dimension, a stronger drag reduction is observed; this observed morphology-dependent reduction indicates Stokes formula is insufficient. The rotational dependence helps to explain the paradox wherein drag enhancement is always encountered insettling-grain experiments popular in geophysics. For the drag of a given rough grain at various orientations, extracted distributions of the overall drag, and its two components, i.e., skin friction and pressure drag, universally adhere to the Weibull patterns. Moreover, we identify a universal power law between drag coefficients and a newly proposed area-related number, sufficiently taking into consideration both grain roughness by surface area and orientational dependence by projected area perpendicular to the flow direction. This law is primarily controlled by relative roughness, with less sensitivity to fractal dimension. The determined expression enables precise estimation of fluid-particle interactions in upscaling simulations.</description>
