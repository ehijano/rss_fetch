      <title>On the Gap Structure of Generalized Stirling Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Katugampola's 2015 study of generalized fractional differential operators produced triangular arrays of integer coefficients indexed by a fractional order r and by dimensions n and k, but no combinatorial interpretation has been established for any fractional order. We give the first such interpretation, with two main results: (i) a complete combinatorial interpretation for r = 1/2 and n = 1,2,3, and (ii) a rigorous proof that this interpretation cannot extend to n &gt;= 4 within the same framework. For n = 1,2,3, we show that the coefficients for r = 1/2 count binary sequences satisfying two conditions: they contain at least one symbol B, and they have gap &lt;= 1, where the gap is the distance between the first and last occurrence of B. Each sequence is assigned a type k by a parity-dependent rule involving the gap value, and exhaustive enumeration matches Katugampola's coefficients exactly. We then prove an obstruction theorem showing that the gap &lt;= 1 condition forces any such model to produce at most two distinct types per row, whereas Katugampola's array requires at least three types for every n &gt;= 4. Thus the gap &lt;= 1 binary-sequence interpretation works if and only if n = 1,2,3. Our results turn a computational observation into a rigorous impossibility theorem and provide guidance for future attempts to obtain complete combinatorial interpretations of fractional-calculus coefficients.</description>

      <title>A complete solution to the directed Oberwolfach problem of order $2 \pmod{4}$ with cycles of even lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oberwolfach problem asks for a $2$-factorization of the complete graph in which each $2$-factor is isomorphic to a specific factor $F$. Recently, this problem has been extended to directed graphs. In this case, the directed Oberwolfach problem asks for a directed 2-factorization of the complete symmetric digraph in which each directed $2$-factor is isomorphic to a specific directed factor $F$. In this paper, we consider the directed Oberwolfach problem with directed 2-factors comprised of cycles of even lengths. Specifically, we provide a complete solution to this particular case when the order of the complete symmetric digraph is congruent to 2 modulo 4.</description>

      <title>Bilateral parking procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of bilateral parking procedures on the integer line. While cars try to park in the nearest available spot to their right in the classical case, we consider more general parking rules that allow cars to use the nearest available spot to their left. We show that for a natural subclass of local procedures, the number of corresponding parking functions of length $r$ is always equal to $(r+1)^{r-1}$. The setting can be extended to probabilistic procedures, in which the decision to park left or right is random. We finally describe how bilateral procedures can naturally be encoded by certain labeled binary forests, whose combinatorics shed light on several results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Symmetric (co)homology polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric edge polytopes are a recent and well-studied family of centrally symmetric polytopes arising from graphs. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this family to arbitrary simplicial complexes. We show how topological properties of a simplicial complex can be translated into geometric properties of such polytopes, and vice versa. We study the integer decomposition property, facets and reflexivity of these polytopes. Using Gr\"obner basis techniques, we obtain a (not necessarily unimodular) triangulation of these polytopes. Due to the tools we use, most of our results hold in the more general setting of arbitrary centrally symmetric polytopes.</description>

      <title>On a Quadratic Relation Between Stanley-Wilf Limits and F\"{u}redi-Hajnal Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a permutation matrix $P$, let $s_P$ denote its Stanley-Wilf limit, the exponential growth rate of the number of $n\times n$ permutation matrices avoiding $P$. Let $c_P$ denote its F\"{u}redi-Hajnal limit, which is the limit $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{ex}(n,P)/n$ where $\text{ex}(n,P)$ is the maximum number of ones in an $n\times n$ $0$-$1$ matrix avoiding $P$. Cibulka proved the universal quadratic bound $s_P\leq 2.88\,c_P^2$. In this note we improve the constants in Cibulka's result through a so-called ``block contraction" argument. Defining \[ F(c)=\inf_{t\in\mathbb{N}} \frac{(t!)^{1/t}\,15^{\,c/t}}{c}, \] for $c&gt;0$, this leads us to the revised inequality $s_P\leq F(c_P)\,c_P^2$. In particular, $F(c)=\log 15+o(1) \approx 2.70805\ldots +o(1)$ as $c\to\infty$, and the constant improves $2.88$ once $c_P \geq 17$.</description>

      <title>On problems of Erd\H{o}s and Baumann-Briggs on minimising the density of $s$-cliques in graphs with forbidden subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using flag algebras, we prove that the minimum density of $8$-cliques in a large graph without an independent set of size $3$ is $491411/268435456+o(1)$, thus resolving a new case of an old problem of Erd\H{o}s [Magyar Tud. Akad. Mat. Kutat\'o Int. K\"ozl. 7 (1962) 459-464]. Also, we establish some other results of this type; for example, we show that the minimum $s$-clique density in a large graph with no independent set of size 3 nor an induced 5-cycle is $2^{1-s}+o(1)$ when $s=4,5,6$. For each of these results, we also describe the structure of all extremal and almost extremal graphs of large order $n$.
  These results are applied to give an asymptotic solution to a number of cases of the problem of Baumann and Briggs [Electronic J Comb 32 (2025) P1.22] which asks for the minimum number of $s$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph in which every $k$-set spans a $t$-clique.</description>

      <title>Uniform Set Systems with Uniform Witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frankl--Pach and Erd\H{o}s conjectured that any $(d+1)$-uniform set family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{d+1}$ with VC-dimension at most $d$ has size at most $\binom{n-1}{d}$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. Ahlswede and Khachatrian showed that the conjecture is false by giving a counterexample of size $\binom{n-1}{d}+\binom{n-4}{d-2}$.
  For a set family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{d+1}$, the condition that its VC-dimension is at most $d$ can be reformulated as follows: for any $F\in\mathcal{F}$, there exists a set $B_F\subseteq F$ such that $F\cap F'\neq B_F$ for all $F'\in\mathcal{F}$. In this direction, the first author, Xu, Yip, and Zhang conjectured that the bound $\binom{n-1}{d}$ holds if we further assume that $|B_F|=s$ for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and for some fixed $0\leq s\leq d$.
  The case $s=0$ is exactly the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem, and the cases $s\in \{1,d\}$ were proved in the paper by the first author, Xu, Yip, and Zhang. In this short note, we show that the conjecture holds when $s\leq d/2$, and the maximal constructions are stars. Moreover, we construct non-star set families of size $\binom{n-1}{d}$ satisfying the condition for $d/2&lt;s\leq d-1$, which suggests that the problem is substantially different in these cases.</description>

      <title>Canonical labelling of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that whenever $d=d(n)\to\infty$ and $n-d\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, then with high probability for any non-trivial initial colouring, the colour refinement algorithm distinguishes all vertices of the random regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$. This, in particular, implies that with high probability $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ admits a canonical labelling computable in time $O(\min\{n^{\omega},nd^2+nd\log n\})$, where $\omega&lt;2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>On Sets of Monochromatic Objects in Bicolored Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line, each colored \emph{red} or \emph{blue}. The classical Motzkin--Rabin theorem guarantees the existence of a \emph{monochromatic} line. Motivated by the seminal work of Green and Tao (2013) on the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we investigate the quantitative and structural properties of monochromatic geometric objects, such as lines, circles, and conics.
  We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines. We then show a converse of a theorem of Jamison (1986): Given $n\ge 6$ blue points and $n$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all red points are collinear. We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Mili\'cevi\'c (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \emph{near-pencil} configuration. Finally, we examine monochromatic circles and conics, and exhibit several natural families in which no such monochromatic objects exist.</description>

      <title>Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k&lt;n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.</description>

      <title>Neural codes via homological invariants of polarized neural ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a neural code $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathbb{F}_2^n$, polarizing the canonical form generators of the neural ideal $J_{\mathcal{C}}$ yields a squarefree monomial ideal $\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}})\subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_n]$, the polarized neural ideal, and an associated simplicial complex $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, the polar complex. We study the graded invariants $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))$ and $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))$ via the topology of $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, showing that simple geometric features of the Hamming cube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ (with Hamming distance) organize their extremal behavior. We prove $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))\le 2n-1$, with equality precisely when $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained from $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ by deleting an antipodal pair. Using connectedness properties of induced subcomplexes of $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, we obtain $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))\le 2n-3$, and we give an explicit family of codes attaining equality, each consisting of antipodal pairs. At the opposite end, we identify the cube geometry behind the smallest values: $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))=1$ forces $\mathcal{C}$ to be a coordinate subcube of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, while $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))=0$ forces $\mathcal{C}$ to be the complement of one. Finally, we construct families realizing large regions of the $(\operatorname{pd},\operatorname{reg})$-plot for fixed $n$.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP with general capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, an integrable long-range stochastic process, on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with inhomogeneities $x_1,\ldots,x_L$ and arbitrary capacity $l$ at each lattice site. The Markov matrix is identified with an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. Stationary probabilities are expressed in a matrix product form involving a fusion of quantized corner transfer matrices for the strange five-vertex model introduced by Okado, Scrimshaw, and the second author. The resulting partition function, which serves as the normalization factor of the stationary probabilities, is obtained from the $l=1$ case by a finite plethystic substitution of length $l$.</description>

      <title>Serre depth and local cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fundamental homological invariant, called \emph{Serre depth}, which stratifies Serre's conditions in the same way that depth stratifies the Cohen-Macaulay property. We study the Serre depths of modules over arbitrary Noetherian local rings and over standard graded algebras over a field, extending the polynomial ring case due to Muta and Terai. Under mild hypotheses, we show that the $r$-th Serre depth of a finitely generated module $M$ measures the deviation of $M$ from satisfying Serre's condition $(S_r)$. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows:
  (i) We establish the basic properties of Serre depth and prove that it is invariant under completion.
  (ii) If the base ring $R$ is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring, we show that a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is equidimensional and satisfies $(S_r)$ if and only if its $r$-th Serre depth equals its Krull dimension. Analogous statements are obtained for schemes.
  (iii) For a homogeneous ideal in a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, we compare its Serre depths with those of its initial ideal.
  (iv) We characterize the Serre depths of a monomial ideal in terms of its skeletons and prove that the Serre depths of sufficiently large powers of a monomial ideal stabilize; the proof uses Presburger arithmetic.</description>

      <title>RLGT: A reinforcement learning framework for extremal graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Tur\'{a}n-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors.

      <title>Comparing Numbers of Diagonal Subsemigroups and Congruences for Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semigroup $S$, a diagonal subsemigroup $\rho$ is defined to be a reflexive and compatible relation on $S$, i.e. a subsemigroup of the direct square $S\times S$ containing the diagonal $\{ (s,s)\colon s\in S\}$. When $S$ is finite, we define the DSC coefficient $\chi(S)$ to be the ratio of the number of congruences to the number of diagonal subsemigroups. In a previous work we observed that $\chi(S) = 1$ if and only if $S$ is a group. Here we show that for any rational $\alpha$ with $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$, there exists a semigroup with $\chi(S) = \alpha$. We do this by utilizing the Rees matrix construction and adapting the congruence classification of such semigroups to describe their diagonal subsemigroups.</description>

      <title>Characteristic quasi-polynomials for deformations of Coxeter arrangements of types A, B, C, and D</title>

Abstract: Kamiya, Takemura, and Terao introduced a characteristic quasi-polynomial which enumerates the numbers of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for specific arrangements which contain the Coxeter arrangements of types A, B, C, and D described by the orthonormal basis. We also compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for their deletion arrangements and we can show that they are factorized.From this result, the poset generated by hypertori of the corresponding toric arrangement is an inductive poset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every graph $G$ with a sufficiently large complete bipartite induced minor, either $G$ has an induced minor isomorphic to a large wall, or $G$ contains a large constellation; that is, a complete bipartite induced minor model such that on one side of the bipartition, each branch set is a singleton, and on the other side, each branch set induces a path.
  We further refine this theorem by characterizing the unavoidable induced subgraphs of large constellations as two types of highly structured constellations. These results will be key ingredients in several forthcoming papers of this series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any $r$-edge coloring of $K_{n,n}$, how large is the maximum (over all $r$ colors) sized monochromatic subgraph guaranteed to be? We give answers to this problem for $r \leq 8$, when $r$ is a perfect square, and when $r$ is one less than a perfect square all up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$. We give a lower bound on this quantity that holds for all $r$ and is sharp when $r$ is a perfect square up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$. Finally, we give a construction for all $r$ which provides an upper bound on this quantity up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$, and which we conjecture is also a lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a plane graph and let $C$ be a cycle in $G$. For each finite face of $G$, count the number of edges of $C$ the face contains. We call this the Slitherlink signature of $C$. The symmetric difference $A$ of two cycles with the same signature is totally even, meaning every vertex is incident to an even number of edges in $A$ and every face contains an even number of edges in $A$. In this paper, we completely characterize totally even subsets in the triangular grid, and count the number of edges in any totally even subset of the triangular grid. We also show that the size of the symmetric difference of two cycles with the same signature in the triangular grid is divisible by $12$; this is best possible since 12 is the greatest common divisor of all the sizes of the symmetric difference between two cycles with the same signature in a triangular grid.</description>

      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results for the case where even cycles are included.</description>

      <title>Finding Minimum Matching Cuts in $H$-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matching cut is a matching that is also an edge cut. In the problem Minimum Matching Cut, we ask for a matching cut with the minimum number of edges in the matching. We investigate the differences in complexity between Minimum Matching Cut, its counterpart Maximum Matching Cut, and the decision problem Matching Cut. Our polynomial-time algorithms for $P_8$-free, $S_{1,1,3}$-free and $(P_6 + P_4)$-free graphs extend the cases where Minimum Matching Cut and Maximum Matching Cut are known to differ in complexity. In addition, they solve open cases for the well-studied problem Matching Cut. The NP-hardness proof for $3P_3$-free graphs implies that Minimum Matching Cut and Matching Cut, which is polynomial-time solvable even for $sP_3$-free graphs, for any $s \geq 1$, differ in complexity on certain graph classes. Further, we give complexity dichotomies for both general and bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter.</description>

      <title>Around the Merino--Welsh conjecture: improving Jackson's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Merino-Welsh conjecture states that for a graph $G$ without loops and bridges the Tutte polynomial $T_G(x,y)$ satisfies the inequality $$\max(T_G(2,0),T_G(0,2))\geqslant T_G(1,1).$$ Later Jackson proved that for any matroid $M$ without loops and coloops we have $$T_M(3,0)T_M(0,3)\geqslant T_M(1,1)^2.$$ The value $3$ in this statement was improved to $2.9243$ by Beke, Cs\'aji, Csikv\'ari and Pituk. In this paper, we further improve on this result by showing that $$T_M(2.355,0)T_M(0,2.355)\geqslant T_M(1,1)^2.$$ We also prove that the Merino--Welsh conjecture is true for matroids $M$, where all circuits of $M$ and its dual $M^*$ have length between $\ell$ and $(\ell-2)^2(\ell^2-4\ell+2)$ for some $\ell\geqslant 4$.</description>

      <title>Counting degree-constrained orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of graph orientations under local degree constraints. Given a finite graph $G = (V, E)$ and a family of admissible sets $\{\mathsf P_v \subseteq \mathbb{Z} : v \in V\}$, let $\mathcal N (G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ denote the number of orientations in which the out-degree of each vertex $v$ lies in $P_v$. We prove a general duality formula expressing $\mathcal N(G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ as a signed sum over edge subsets, involving products of coefficient sums associated with $\{\mathsf P_v\}_{v \in V}$, from a family of polynomials. Our approach employs gauge transformations, a technique rooted in statistical physics and holographic algorithms. We also present a probabilistic derivation of the same identity, interpreting the orientation-generating polynomial as the expectation of a random polynomial product. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the number of even orientations and for mixed Eulerian-even orientations on general graphs. Our formula generalizes a result of Borb\'enyi and Csikv\'ari on Eulerian orientations of graphs.</description>

Abstract: We provide a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that, for a given $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices and edge density $d$, finds a complete $k$-partite subgraph of $H$ with parts of size at least ${c(d, k)(\log n)^{1/(k-1)}}$. This generalizes work by Mubayi and Tur\'{a}n on bipartite graphs. The value we obtain for the part size matches the order of magnitude guaranteed by the non-constructive proof due to Erd\H{o}s and is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Three Generalizations of Erd\H{o}s Szekeres: $k$-Modal Subsequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres showed that given a permutation $p$ of $[n]$, and the sequence defined by \newline $(p(1), p(2), \ldots, p(n))$, there exists either a decreasing or increasing subsequence, not necessarily contiguous, of length at least $\sqrt{n}$. Fan Chung considered subsequences that can have at most one change of direction, i.e. an increasing and then decreasing subsequence, or a decreasing and then increasing subsequence. She called these unimodal subsequences, and showed there exists a unimodal subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{3n}$, up to some constants \cite{chung}. She conjectured that a permutation of $n$ contains a $k$-modal (at most $k$ changes in direction) subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{(2k+1)n}$ up to some constants. Zijian Xu proved this conjecture in 2024 \cite{xu}, and we will provide another substantially different proof using "sophisticated labeling arguments" instead of "underlying poset structures behind k-modal subsequences." We also show that there exists an increasing first $k$-modal subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{2kn}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a flexible random construction which, for certain graphs $H$, is able to produce $H$-free graphs with edge density strictly larger than that of the $H$-free process, while simultaneously preserving pseudorandom properties and allowing a much easier analysis.
  As our main application, we use this construction to show that the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers satisfy $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac12+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$, improving the previously best bound $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac13+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$. While the best known upper bound is $R(3,k)\le \left(1+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$, the constant of $\frac12$ has been conjectured to be asymptotically tight by multiple groups.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study polymatroids that are representable by means of linear restricted rank-metric codes, namely, by subspaces of the space of alternating, symmetric, or Hermitian square matrices endowed with the rank metric. More precisely, we characterize the rank function defining these polymatroids and establish sufficient conditions on the relevant parameters under which it is fully determined. We show that there are several differences in compared to the behaviour of $q$-polymatroids of unrestricted matrix codes.</description>

      <title>M\"obius inversion and the iterated bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating nonlinear functionals of probability distributions from samples is a fundamental statistical problem. The "plug-in" estimator obtained by applying the target functional to the empirical distribution of samples is biased. Resampling methods such as the bootstrap derive artificial datasets from the original one by resampling. Comparing the outcome of the plug-in estimator in the original and resampled datasets allows estimating and thus correcting the bias. In the asymptotic setting, iterations of this procedure attain an arbitrarily high order of bias correction, but finite sample results are scarce. This work develops a new theoretical understanding of bootstrap bias correction by viewing it as an iterative linear solver for the combinatorial operation of M\"obius inversion. It sharply characterizes the regime of linear convergence of the bootstrap bias reduction for moment polynomials. It uses these results to show its superalgebraic convergence rate for band-limited functionals. Finally, it derives a modified bootstrap iteration enabling the unbiased estimation of unknown order-$m$ moment polynomials in $m$ bootstrap iterations.</description>

Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Ramsey's witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Ramsey partition regularity, a generalisation of partition regularity involving infinitary configurations. We provide characterisations of this notion in terms of certain ultrafilters related to tensor products and dubbed Ramsey's witnesses; and we also consider their nonstandard counterparts as pairs of hypernatural numbers, called Ramsey pairs. These characterisations are then used to determine whether various configurations involving polynomials and exponentials are Ramsey partition regular over the natural numbers. In particular, this provides negative answers to several questions recently posed by Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>On pairs of triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square and pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $2$ for three restricted partition functions of Pushpa and Vasuki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish infinite families of congruences modulo arbitrary powers of $2$ for the three restricted partition functions $M(n), T^\ast(n)$, and $P^\ast(n)$ introduced by Pushpa and Vasuki by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These generalize some particular congruences for $M(n), T^\ast(n)$, and $P^\ast(n)$ recently found by Nath and Saikia.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Homomorphism Reconstruction Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of reconstructing a graph from homomorphism counts that has first been studied in (B\"oker et al., STACS 2024): given graphs $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ and counts $m_1,\ldots,m_k$, decide if there is a graph $G$ such that the number of homomorphisms from $F_i$ to $G$ is $m_i$, for all $i$. We prove that the problem is NEXP-hard if the counts $m_i$ are specified in binary and $\Sigma_2^p$-complete if they are in unary. Furthermore, as a positive result, we show that the unary version can be solved in polynomial time if the constraint graphs are stars of bounded size.</description>
