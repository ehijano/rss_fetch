      <title>Cordial Labeling of Goldberg Snark and its related Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graph theory, a Snark is a connected, bridgeless, Cubic graph that cannot be edge-colored with only three colors. Additionally, to avoid some trivial cases, a Snark is typically required to have a girth of minimum five and a cyclic connectivity of minimum four. In this paper, we investigate the Cordial labeling, for one of the modified structures of Snark graph which is known as Goldberg Snark graph. Moreover, a few special forms of Goldberg Snark graph also admit the Cordial labeling.</description>

      <title>Distinguishability and linear independence for $H$-chromatic symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $H$-chromatic symmetric functions $X_G^H$ (introduced in (arXiv:2011.06063) as a generalization of the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) $X_G$), which track homomorphisms from the graph $G$ to the graph $H$. We focus first on the case of self-chromatic symmetric functions (self-CSFs) $X_G^G$, making some progress toward a conjecture from (arXiv:2011.06063) that the self-CSF, like the normal CSF, is always different for different trees. In particular, we show that the self-CSF distinguishes trees from non-trees with just one exception, we check using Sage that it distinguishes all trees on up to 12 vertices, and we show that it determines the number of legs of a spider and the degree sequence of a caterpillar given its spine length. We also show that the self-CSF detects the number of connected components of a forest, again with just one exception. Then we prove some results about the power sum expansions for $H$-CSFs when $H$ is a complete bipartite graph, in particular proving that the conjecture from (arXiv:2011.06063) about $p$-monotonicity of $\omega(X_G^H)$ for $H$ a star holds as long as $H$ is sufficiently large compared to $G$. We also show that the self-CSFs of complete multipartite graphs form a basis for the ring $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions, and we give some construction of bases for the vector space $\Lambda^n$ of degree $n$ symmetric functions using $H$-CSFs $X_G^H$ where $H$ is a fixed graph that is not a complete graph, answering a question from (arXiv:2011.06063) about whether such bases exist. However, we show that there generally do not exist such bases with $G$ fixed, even with loops, answering another question from (arXiv:2011.06063). We also define the $H$-chromatic polynomial as an analogue of the chromatic polynomial, and ask when it is the same for different graphs.</description>

      <title>On the dib-chromatic number of a digraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An acyclic coloring of a digraph that maximizes the number of colors such that each color class has a vertex pointing to all other classes and a vertex pointing to it from all other classes is known as the dib-chromatic number of a digraph. In this paper, we answer the question about the existence of the dib-chromatic number and study the dib-chromatic number of bipartite digraphs.</description>

      <title>VC-dimension of Salem sets over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension.
  These questions are related to the Erd\H{o}s distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erd\H{o}s distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</description>

      <title>Linear Saturation for $\mathcal N$ via Butterflies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, how small can a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ be such that $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but $\mathcal F\cup\{X\}$ contains such a copy for all $X\in\mathcal P([n])\setminus\mathcal F$? This is known as the induced saturation number of $\mathcal P$, denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal P)$. The main conjecture in the area is that the induced saturation number for any poset is either bounded, or linear.
  In this paper we establish linearity for the induced saturation number of the 4-point poset $\mathcal N$. Previously, it was known that $2\sqrt n\leq\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal N)\leq 2n$. We show that $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal N)\geq\frac{n+6}{4}$. A crucial role in the proof is played by a structural feature of $\mathcal N$-saturated families, namely that if the family contains two antichains, one completely above the other, then it must also contain a `middle' point -- greater than one antichain and less than the other.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Products of dual Jacobi-Trudi matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positivity properties of Hadamard products of Jacobi-Trudi matrices. Mal\'{o} proved that the Hadamard (entrywise) product of two totally positive upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices whose Toeplitz sequences are the coefficient sequences of real-rooted polynomials with nonpositive zeros is again totally positive. Sokal conjectured that this result can be strengthened to total monomial positivity for the Hadamard product of Jacobi-Trudi matrices. In this paper we show that Temperley-Lieb immanants are Schur positive for Hadamard products of Jacobi-Trudi matrices given by ribbon-like skew shapes. In particular, we affirm Sokal's conjecture for minors given by ribbon-like skew shapes. Moreover, we provide a manifestly positive Schur expansion for Temperley-Lieb immanants evaluated on the Hadamard product of Jacobi-Trudi matrices indexed by ribbons. In addition, for the ribbon case, we construct a corresponding representation, offering a representation-theoretic proof of the Schur positivity.</description>

      <title>On minimum Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-Venn diagram is a diagram in the plane consisting of $n$ simple closed curves that intersect only finitely many times such that each of the $2^n$ possible intersections is represented by a single connected region. An $n$-Venn diagram has at most $2^n-2$ crossings, and if this maximum number of crossings is attained, then only two curves intersect in every crossing. To complement this, Bultena and Ruskey considered $n$-Venn diagrams that minimize the number of crossings, which implies that many curves intersect in every crossing. Specifically, they proved that the total number of crossings in any $n$-Venn diagram is at least $L_n:=\lceil\frac{2^n-2}{n-1}\rceil$, and if this lower bound is attained then essentially all $n$ curves intersect in every crossing. Diagrams achieving this bound are called minimum Venn diagrams, and are known only for $n\leq 7$. Bultena and Ruskey conjectured that they exist for all $n\geq 8$. In this work, we establish an asympototic version of their conjecture. For $n=8$ we construct a diagram with 40 crossings, only 3 more than the lower bound $L_8=37$. Furthermore, for every $n$ of the form $n=2^k$ for some integer $k\geq 4$, we construct an $n$-Venn diagram with at most $(1+\frac{33}{8n})L_n=(1+o(1))L_n$ many crossings. Via a doubling trick this also gives $(n+m)$-Venn diagrams for all $0\leq m&lt;n$ with at most $40\cdot 2^m$ crossings for $n=8$ and at most $(1+\frac{33}{8n})\frac{n+m}{n}L_{n+m}=(2+o(1))L_{n+m}$ many crossings for $k\geq 4$. In particular, we obtain $n$-Venn diagrams with the smallest known number of crossings for all $n\geq 8$. Our constructions are based on partitions of the hypercube into isometric paths and cycles, using a result of Ramras.</description>

      <title>The tropical galaxy of a Laman graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Laman graph $G$ is a minimally rigid graph in dimension two, and its realization number is its number of distinct embeddings with fixed generic edge lengths. While conjectured to grow exponentially in the number of vertices of $G$, the best proven lower bound is merely $2$. Motivated by the fact that the realization number can be expressed as a tropical intersection product involving $\mathrm{Trop}(G)$, the Bergman fan of the graphic matroid of $G$, and the fact that stars of $\mathrm{Trop}(G)$ naturally lead to lower bounds thereof, we introduce the tropical galaxy of $G$ together with a galactic pairing thereon. We study structural properties of this pairing, such as under which conditions it is non-trivially subadditive, and connect it being non-zero to arboreal pairs. We also present a software package for working with tropical galaxies.</description>

      <title>Maximal cell of the shifted standard random Young tableaux of shape (2n-1,2n-3,...,3,1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we explicitly compute the probability that a given cell in a random standard Young tableau of the shifted staircase shape $(2n-1, 2n-3, \ldots, 3,1)$ contains the maximal label. We also show that the asymptotic distribution of the cell containing the maximal label is governed by the quarter-circle law. The bijection between the tableaux and thereduced decompositions of the longest element of the group $B_n$ of the signed permutations yields the probability distribution of the first (and any) letter of the random reduced decompositions. We also show the results of some computational experiments on the random sorting networks of $B_n$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simplified proof of the following special case of Wegner's conjecture: every planar graph of maximum degree at most three admits a distance-2 coloring with at most eight colors. Our main contribution is significant simplification of the most technically challenging part of Wegner's proof: the case involving the removal of a 5-cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the poset of $q$-decreasing words equipped with the componentwise order forms a lattice. We enumerate the join-irreducible elements for arbitrary $q&gt;0$, and for any positive rational number $q$, we determine the number of coverings, intervals and meet-irreducible elements. The latter present the same structure as words over an alphabet of $2\lceil q\rceil+1$ letters avoiding $\lceil q\rceil^2+2\lceil q\rceil-1$ consecutive patterns of length 2. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of several of these quantities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the largest commutative (full and partial) transformation semigroups of certain types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\mathcal{T}(X)$ be the transformation semigroup on $X$ and let $\mathcal{P}(X)$ be the partial transformation semigroup on $X$. This paper is a contribution to the problem of characterizing the largest commutative subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$). In the process of looking for these semigroups, we also characterize the largest commutative subsemigroups of idempotents of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$); as well as the largest commutative subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$) that contain a unique idempotent. We also provide an alternative way to determine the largest commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (which were previously characterized by Cain, Malheiro and the present author); and we describe the largest commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mathcal{P}(X)$.
  These results allow us to make conclusions regarding the clique numbers of the commuting graphs of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ and of $\mathcal{P}(X)$. We also determine their girths and knit degrees.</description>

      <title>A recursion for the twist polynomial of a one-point join of normal binary delta-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial-dual Euler-genus polynomial was defined by Gross, Mansour, and Tucker to analyze how the Euler genus of a ribbon graph changes under partial duality, a generalization of Euler-Poincar\'{e} duality introduced by Chmutov. The twist polynomial defined by Yan and Jin extends the partial-dual Euler-genus polynomial to a polynomial on delta-matroids. We derive a recursion formula for the twist polynomial of a one-point join of looped simple graphs -- equivalently, normal, binary delta-matroids. Our recursion applies to the partial-dual Euler-genus polynomial as a special case, where it generalizes a recursion obtained by Yan and Jin. We obtain relations for the twist polynomial on looped simple graphs evaluated at $-1/2$ and for the twist polynomial of a graph with a single looped vertex. A characterization is given for the feasible sets of the delta-matroid associated to a one-point join of looped simple graphs. We show that Yan and Jin's recursion extends to the twist polynomial on delta-matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of equiangular lines, equiangular subspaces were first systematically studied by Balla, Dr\"{a}xler, Keevash and Sudakov in 2017. In this paper, we extend their work to $s$-distance subspaces, i.e., to sets of $k$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose pairwise distances take $s$ distinct values. We establish upper bounds on the maximum cardinality of such sets. In particular, our bounds generalize and improve results of Balla and Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Bott manifolds of Bott--Samelson type and assemblies of ordered partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bott manifold is a smooth projective toric variety having an iterated $\mathbb{C} P^1$-bundle structure. A certain family of Bott manifolds is used to understand the structure of Bott--Samelson varieties (or Bott--Samelson--Demazure--Hansen varieties), which provide desingularizations of Schubert varieties. Indeed, each Bott--Samelson variety is diffeomorphic to a Bott manifold. However, not all Bott manifolds originate from Bott--Samelson varieties. Those that do are specifically referred to as Bott manifolds of Bott--Samelson type. In this paper, we provide a characterization of Bott manifolds of Bott--Samelson type by exploring their relationship with combinatorial objects called assemblies of ordered partitions. Using this relationship, we enumerate Bott manifolds of Bott--Samelson type and describe isomorphic Bott manifolds of Bott--Samelson type in terms of assemblies of ordered partitions.</description>

      <title>Multiple Rogers-Ramanujan type identities for inert quadratic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Quot and finitized Coh zeta functions of the inert quadratic orders $\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]+T^{m}\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}[[T]]$ for every $m\geq 1$ in terms of a $2m$-fold multisum, and then show this multisum equals an $m$-fold Bressoud sum. This proves a recent conjecture of the second author, rounding up the line of exploration in the series of work by the authors and Jiang. The equality between the $2m$-fold multisum and the $m$-fold Bressoud sum is built upon generalizing the multisum by introducing a ``ghost'' parameter $a$ to its summands. We then show that such an $a$-generalization is surprisingly $a$-independent by purely $q$-theoretic techniques. Finally, we propose a refined multisum that interpolates two versions of Quot zeta functions for all three types of quadratic orders.</description>

      <title>Pure-State Quantum Tomography with Minimal Rank-One POVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography seeks to reconstruct an unknown state from measurement statistics. A finite measurement (POVM) is \emph{pure-state informationally complete} (PSI-Complete) if the outcome probabilities determine any pure state up to a global phase. We study \emph{rank-one} POVMs that are minimally sufficient for this task. We call such a POVM \emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.
  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \(n\): the size is at most \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) and at most \(n^{2}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \(w \mid n(n-1)\), an \((n,w,w-1)\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \(n + n(n-1)/w\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \(w=2,n-1\), and \(n\).</description>

      <title>Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type results for partitions via spread approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address several Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type questions for families of partitions. Two partitions of $[n]$ are {\it $t$-intersecting} if they share at least $t$ parts, and are {\it partially $t$-intersecting} if some of their parts intersect in at least $t$ elements. The question of what is the largest family of pairwise $t$-intersecting partitions was studied for several classes of partitions: Peter Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely studied partitions of $[n]$ into $\ell$ parts of unrestricted size; Ku and Renshaw studied unrestricted partitions of $[n]$; Meagher and Moura, and then Godsil and Meagher studied partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size. We improve and generalize the results proved by these authors. Meagher and Moura, following the work of Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely, introduced the notion of partially $t$-intersecting partitions, and conjectured, what should be the largest partially $t$-intersecting family of partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size $k$. The main result of this paper is the proof of their conjecture for all $t, k$, provided $\ell$ is sufficiently large. All our results are applications of the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the author. In order to use it, we need to refine some of the theorems from the original paper. As a byproduct, this makes the present paper a self-contained presentation of the spread approximation technique for $t$-intersecting problems.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with covering number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a graph and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a hereditary class of theta-free graphs such that $H\notin \mathcal{C}$. We prove that if (a) $H$ is a forest; and (b) $\mathcal{C}$ excludes the line graphs of all subdivisions of some wall, then the treewidth of every graph in $\mathcal{C}$ is at most a polynomial function of its clique number. This is best possible in that both (a) and (b) are necessary for the existence of $any$ function with the above property.</description>

      <title>Three more proofs of two congruences for Merca's partition function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Clark Kimberling defined an interesting sequence ${\bf B} = 0100101100 \cdots$ of $0$'s and $1$'s by certain inflation rules, and he made a number of conjectures about this sequence and some related ones. In this note we prove his conjectures using, in part, the Walnut theorem-prover. We show how his word is related to the infinite Tribonacci word, and we determine both the subword complexity and critical exponent of $\bf B$.</description>

      <title>On $\{k\}$-Roman graphs: complexity of recognition and the case of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a function $f\colon V \rightarrow \{0,1,\ldots,k\}$ satisfying $f (N(v)) \geq k$ for each vertex $v\in V$ with $f (v) = 0$. Every graph $G$ satisfies $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G) \leq k\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G)$ denotes the minimum weight of a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of $G$ and $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number of $G$. In this work we study graphs for which the equality is reached, called \emph{$\{k\}$-Roman graphs}. This extends the concept of $\{k\}$-Roman trees studied by Wang et al. in 2021 to general graphs. We prove that for every $k\geq 3$, the problem of recognizing $\{k\}$-Roman graphs is NP-hard, even when restricted to split graphs. We provide partial answers to the question of which split graphs are $\{2\}$-Roman: we characterize $\{2\}$-Roman split graphs that can be decomposed with respect to the split join operation into two smaller split graphs and classify the $\{k\}$-Roman property within two specific families of split graphs that are prime with respect to the split join operation: suns and their complements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation of stability, called almost sure stability, which is insensitive to perturbations by subsets of Loeb measure $0$ in a non-standard finite group. We show that almost sure stability satisfies a stationarity principle in the sense of geometric stability theory for measure independent elements. We apply this principle to deduce the existence of squares in dense almost surely stable subsets of Cartesian products of non-standard finite groups, possibly non-abelian. Our results imply qualitative asymptotic versions for Cartesian products of finite groups. In the final section, we establish the existence of $3\times 2$-grids (and thus of $L$-shapes) in dense almost surely stable $2$-dimensional subsets of finite abelian groups of odd order.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations. Namely, we explain how to construct uniform permutations in given conjugacy classes from certain point processes in the plane. This enables the use of geometric tools to study various statistics of such permutations. For their longest decreasing subsequences, we prove universality of the $2\sqrt n$ asymptotic. For Robinson--Schensted shapes, we prove universality of the Vershik--Kerov--Logan--Shepp limit curve, thus solving a conjecture of Kammoun. For the number of records, we establish a phase transition phenomenon as the number of fixed points grows. For pattern counts, we obtain an asymptotic normality result, partially answering a conjecture of Hamaker and Rhoades.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic monotiles: from geometry to groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, two striking, nearly simultaneous, mathematical discoveries have excited their respective communities, one by Greenfeld and Tao, the other (the Hat tile) by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss, which can both be summed up as the following: there exists a single tile that tiles, but not periodically (sometimes dubbed the einstein problem). The two settings and the tools are quite different (as emphasized by their almost disjoint bibliographies): one in euclidean geometry, the other in group theory. Both are highly nontrivial: in the first case, one allows complex shapes; in the second one, also the space to tile may be complex. We propose here a framework that embeds both of these problems. From any tile system in this general framework, with some natural additional conditions, we exhibit a construction to simulate it by a group-theoretical tiling. We illustrate our setting by transforming the Hat tile into a new aperiodic group monotile, and we describe the symmetries of both the geometrical Hat tilings and the group tilings we obtain.</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. The main results in this paper are (1) a construction of smaller spherical designs via an explicit connection to Gaussian designs and (2) the exact order of magnitude of minimal-size signed $t$-designs, which is far less than predicted by a typical degrees-of-freedom heuristic. We also establish a method to ``project'' spherical designs between dimensions, prove a variety of results on approximate designs, and construct new $t$-wise independent subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,q\}^d$ which may be of independent interest. To achieve these results, we combine techniques from algebra, geometry, probability, representation theory, and optimization.</description>
