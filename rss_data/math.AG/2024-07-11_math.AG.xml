      <title>Inversion of the Abel--Prym map in presence of an additional involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike Abel map of the symmetric power of a Riemann surface onto its Jacobian, the Abel--Prym map generically can not be reversed by means of conventional technique related to the Jacobi inversion problem, and of its main ingredient, namely the Riemann vanishing theorem. It happens because the corresponding analog of the Riemann vanishing theorem gives twice as many points as the dimension of the Prym variety. However, if the Riemann surface has a second involution commuting with the one defining the Prym variety and satisfying a certain additional condition, an analog of the Jacobi inversion can be defined, and expressed in terms of the Prym theta function. We formulate these conditions and refer to the pairs of involutions satisfying them as to pairs of the first type. We formulate necessary conditions for the pair of involutions to be a pair of the first type, and give a series of examples of curves with such pairs of involutions, mainly spectral curves of Hitchin systems, and also a spectral curve of the Kovalewski system.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic tame Tate twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, H\"ubner-Schmidt defined the tame site of a scheme. We define $p$-adic tame Tate twists in the tame topology and prove some first properties. We establish a framework analogous to the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures in the tame topology for $p$-adic tame Tate twists and tame logarithmic deRham-Witt sheaves. Both only differ from their \'etale counterpart in cohomological degrees above the weight. These cohomology groups can be analysed using the Gersten conjecture which, at least conjecturally, has a nice shape in the tame topology. We prove the Gersten conjecture for tame logarithmic deRham-Witt sheaves for curves in positive characteristic and note that the conjecture in arbitrary dimension would follow from strict $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Hilbert-Burch matrices, we give an explicit description of the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells on the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb A ^2$ with isolated fixed points. If the fixed point locus is positive dimensional we obtain an \'etale rational map to the cell. We prove Conjecture 4.2 from arXiv:2309.06871 which we realize as a special case of our construction. We also show examples when the construction provides a rational \'etale map to the Hilbert scheme which is not contained in any Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cell. Finally, we give an explicit description of the formal deformations of any ideal in the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane.</description>

      <title>Constructively describing orbit spaces of finite groups by few inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting linearly on $\mathbb{R}^n$. A celebrated Theorem of Procesi and Schwarz gives an explicit description of the orbit space $\mathbb{R}^n /\!/G$ as a basic closed semi-algebraic set. We give a new proof of this statement and another description as a basic closed semi-algebraic set using elementary tools from real algebraic geometry. Br\"ocker was able to show that the number of inequalities needed to describe the orbit space generically depends only on the group $G$. Here, we construct such inequalities explicitly for abelian groups and in the case where only one inequality is needed. Furthermore, we answer an open question raised by Br\"ocker concerning the genericity of his result.</description>

      <title>Typical ranks of random order-three tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study typical ranks of real $m\times n \times \ell$ tensors. In the case $ (m-1)(n-1)+1 \leq \ell \leq mn$ the typical ranks are contained in $\{\ell, \ell +1\}$, and $\ell$ is always a typical rank. We provide a geometric proof of this fact. We express the probabilities of these ranks in terms of the probabilities of the numbers of intersection points of a random linear space with the Segre variety. In addition, we give some heuristics to understand how the probabilities of these ranks behave, based on asymptotic results on the average number of real points in a random linear slice of a Segre variety with a subspace of complementary dimension.
  The typical ranks of real $3\times 3\times 5$ tensors are $5$ and $6$. We link the rank probabilities of a $3\times 3 \times 5$ tensor with i.i.d.\ Gaussian entries to the probability of a random cubic surface in $\P^3$ having real lines. As a consequence, we get a bound on the expected number of real lines on such a surface.</description>

      <title>Complex reflection groups as differential Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups comprise a generalization of Weyl groups of semisimple Lie algebras, and even more generally of finite Coxeter groups. They have been heavily studied since their introduction and complete classification in the 1950s by Shephard and Todd, due to their many applications to combinatorics, representation theory, knot theory, and mathematical physics, to name a few examples. For each given complex reflection group G, we explain a new recipe for producing an integrable system of linear differential equations whose differential Galois group is precisely G. We exhibit these systems explicitly for many (low-rank) irreducible complex reflection groups in the Shephard-Todd classification.</description>

      <title>Gluing invariants of Donaldson--Thomas type -- Part I: the Darboux stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a (-1)-shifted symplectic derived Deligne--Mumford stack. In this paper we introduce the Darboux stack of $X$, parametrizing local presentations of $X$ as a derived critical locus of a function $f$ on a smooth formal scheme $U$. Local invariants such as the Milnor number $\mu_f$, the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles $\mathsf{P}_{U,f}$ and the category of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ are naturally defined on the Darboux stack, without ambiguity. The stack of non-degenerate flat quadratic bundles acts on the Darboux stack and our main theorem is the contractibility of the quotient stack when taking a further homotopy quotient identifying isotopic automorphisms. As a corollary we recover the gluing results for vanishing cycles by Brav--Bussi--Dupont--Joyce--Szendr\H oi. In a second part (to appear), we will apply this general mechanism to glue the motives of the locally defined categories of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ under the prescription of additional orientation data, thus answering positively conjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.</description>

      <title>Syzygies of projected canonical and paracanonical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^r$ be an integral linearly normal variety and $R=k[x_0,\cdots,x_r]$ the coordinate ring of $\mathbb{P}^r$. It is known that the syzygies of $X$ contain some geometric information. In recent years the syzygies of non-projectively normal varieties or in other words, the projection $X'$ of $X$ away from a linear subspace $W\subset\mathbb{P}^r$, were taken into considerations. Assuming that the coordinate ring of the ambient space that $X'$ lives in is $S$, there are two types of vanishing properties of the Betti diagrams of the projected varieties, the so-called $N_{d,p}^S$ and $\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$. The former one have been widely discussed for general varieties, for example by S. Kwak, Y. Choi and E. Park, while the latter one was discussed by W. Lee and E. Park for curves of very large degree.
  In this paper I will discuss about the $\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$ properties of the projection of a generic canonical and paracanonical curve away from a generic point and in particular whether they are cut out by quadrics. Some conjectures will be claimed based on the tests on Macaulay2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article generalizes the theory of shifted symplectic structures to the relative context and non-geometric stacks. We describe basic constructions that naturally appear in this theory: shifted cotangent bundles and the AKSZ procedure. Along the way, we also develop the theory of shifted symplectic groupoids presenting shifted symplectic structures on quotients and define a deformation to the normal cone for shifted Lagrangian morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a regular, irreducible curve that is projective over a field. We obtain bounds in terms of the arithmetic genus of $C$ for the generators that are required for the cokernel of the tame symbol, as well as, under a simplifying assumption, its kernel. We briefly discuss a potential application to Chow groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A point set $M$ in Euclidean plane is called an integral point set in semi-general position if all the distances between the elements of $M$ are integers, and $M$ does not contain collinear triples. We improve the lower bound for diameter of such sets in the particular case when the characteristic of the set is of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+2$. To achieve that, we combine hyperbolae-based and grid-based toolsets.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>

      <title>On non-Zariski density of $(D,S)$-integral points in forward orbits and the Subspace Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working over a base number field $\KK$, we study the attractive question of Zariski non-density for $(D,S)$-integral points in $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$ the forward $f$-orbit of a rational point $x \in X(\KK)$. Here, $f \colon X \rightarrow X$ is a regular surjective self-map for $X$ a geometrically irreducible projective variety over $\KK$. Given a non-zero and effective $f$-quasi-polarizable Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ and defined over $\KK$, our main result gives a sufficient condition, that is formulated in terms of the $f$-dynamics of $D$, for non-Zariski density of certain dynamically defined subsets of $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. For the case of $(D,S)$-integral points, this result gives a sufficient condition for non-Zariski density of integral points in $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. Our approach expands on that of Yasufuku, \cite{Yasufuku:2015}, building on earlier work of Silverman \cite{Silverman:1993}. Our main result gives an unconditional form of the main results of loc.~cit.; the key arithmetic input to our main theorem is the Subspace Theorem of Schmidt in the generalized form that has been given by Ru and Vojta in \cite{Ru:Vojta:2016} and expanded upon in \cite{Grieve:points:bounded:degree} and \cite{Grieve:qualitative:subspace}.</description>

      <title>GIT stability of linear maps on projective space with marked points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct moduli spaces of linear self-maps of projective space with marked points, up to projective equivalence. That is, we let the special linear group act simultaneously by conjugation on projective linear maps and diagonally on $(\mathbb{P}^N)^n$, and we take the geometric invariant theory (GIT) quotient. These moduli spaces arise in algebraic dynamics and integrable systems. Our main result is a dynamical characterization of the GIT semistable and stable loci in the space of linear maps $T$ with marked points. We show that GIT stability can be checked by counting the marked points on flags with certain Hessenberg functions relative to $T$. The proof is combinatorial: to describe the weight polytopes for this action, we compute the vertices and facets of certain convex polyhedra generated by roots of the $A_N$ lattice.</description>

      <title>A relative Nash-Tognoli theorem over $\mathbb{Q}$ and application to the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraicity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a relative version over $\mathbb{Q}$ of Nash-Tognoli theorem, that is: Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold with closed smooth submanifolds $M_1,\dots,M_\ell$ in general position, then there exists a nonsingular real algebraic set $M'\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with nonsingular algebraic subsets $M_1',\dots,M_\ell'$ and a diffeomorphism $h:M\to M'$ such that $h(M_i)=M_i'$ for all $i=1,\dots,\ell$ such that $M',M_1',\dots,M_\ell'$ are described, both globally and locally, by polynomial equations with rational coefficients. In addition, if $M,M_1,\dots,M_\ell$ are nonsingular algebraic sets, then we prove the diffeomorphism $h:M\to M'$ can be chosen semialgebraic and the result can be extended to the noncompact case. In the proof we describe also the $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-homological cycles of real embedded Grassmannian manifolds by nonsingular algebraic representatives over $\mathbb{Q}$ via the Bott-Samelson resolution of Schubert varieties.</description>

Abstract: We provide a characterization of homogeneous spaces under a reductive group  scheme such that the geometric stabilizers are maximal tori.  The quasi-split case over a semilocal base is of special  interest and permits to   answer a  question raised by Marc Levine  on homogeneous SL$_n$-spaces. At the end, we provide an application to the local-global principles for embeddings of {\'e}tale algebras with involution into central simple algebras with involution.</description>

Abstract: Freeness is an important property of a hypersurface arrangement, although its presence is not well understood. A hypersurface arrangement in $\PP^n$ is free if $S/J$ is Cohen-Macaulay (CM), where $S = K[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ and $J$ is the Jacobian ideal. We study three related unmixed ideals: $J^{top}$, the intersection of height two primary components, $\sqrt{J^{top}}$, the radical of $J^{top}$, and when the $f_i$ are smooth we also study $\sqrt{J}$. Under mild hypotheses, we show that these ideals are CM. This establishes a full generalization of an earlier result with Schenck from hyperplane arrangements to hypersurface arrangements. If the hypotheses fail for an arrangement in projective $3$-space, the Hartshorne-Rao module measures the failure of CMness. We establish consequences for the even liaison classes of $J^{top}$ and $\sqrt{J}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex smooth Fano variety of dimension at least four. In this paper, we classify such $X$ when the pseudoindex is at least $n-2$ and the Picard number greater than one. We also discuss the relations between pseudoindex and other invariants of Fano varieties.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero loci of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain two applications in different directions of algebra/algebraic geometry.
  The first application is a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  The second application is a commutativity criterion for operators in the Weyl algebra or, more generally, in the ring of ordinary differential operators, which we prove in the case when operators have a normal form with the restriction top line (for details see Introduction).
  Both applications are obtained with the help of normal forms. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a restricted finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of finite groups through (basic) algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to representation theory of finite groups that uses some basic algebraic geometry and allows to do all the theory without using characters. With this approach, to any finite group $G$ we associate a finite number of points and show that any field containing the coordinates of those points works fine as the ground field for the representations of $G$. We apply this point of view to the symmetric group $S_d$, finding easy equations for the different symmetries of functions in $d$ variables. As a byproduct, we give an easy proof of a recent result by Tocino that states that the hyperdeterminant of a $d$-dimensional matrix is zero for all but two types of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ding stability and K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on manifolds with big anticanonical class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of uniform Ding stability for a projective manifold with big anticanonical class, and prove that the existence of a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric on such a manifold implies uniform Ding stability. The main new techniques are to develop a general theory of Deligne functionals - and corresponding slope formulas - for singular metrics, and to prove a slope formula for the Ding functional in the big setting. This extends work of Berman in the Fano situation, when the anticanonical class is actually ample, and proves one direction of the analogue of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture in this setting. We also speculate about the relevance of uniform Ding stability and K-stability to moduli in the big setting.</description>

      <title>Atypical values at infinity of real polynomial maps with $2$-dimensional fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial function of three variables by a certain sum of indices of the gradient vector field of the function restricted to a sphere with a sufficiently large radius. This is an analogy of a result of Coste and de la Puente for real polynomial functions with two variables. We also give a characterization of atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial map whose regular fibers are $2$-dimensional surfaces.</description>

      <title>The $m$-step solvable anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a mixed-characteristic local field, and let $m$ be an integer $\geq 0$. We shall denote by $K^m/K$ the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K$, and write $G_K^{m}$ for the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$; we will regard $G_K$ and its quotients as filtered profinite groups, by equipping those with the corresponding ramification filtrations (in upper numbering). It is known from the previous result due to Mochizuki that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_K$. In this paper, we prove (with some mono-anabelian results) that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the maximal metabelian quotient $G_K^2$ as a filtered profinite group, and further that $K^{m}/K$ is determined functorially by the filtered profinite group $G_{K}^{m+2}$ (resp. $G_{K}^{m+3}$) for $m\geq 2$ (resp. $m\leq 1$).</description>
