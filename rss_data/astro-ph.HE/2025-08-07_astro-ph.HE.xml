      <title>Unified understanding of Alfv\'enic superradiance and the Blandford-Znajek process in a force-free black hole magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extraction of energy from a Kerr black hole via Alfv\'en waves (i.e., Alfv\'enic superradiance) in a force-free magnetosphere, in which the plasma inertia effects are ignored. We analyze the Poynting flux generated by Alfv\'en waves that propagate toward the event horizon across the inner light surface, the causal boundary for the waves. We find the relationship between the energy flux associated with Alfv\'en waves and that of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. That is, both mechanisms can be described within a unified formulation of the Poynting flux, where the BZ process can be regarded as the long wavelength limit of the Alfv\'enic superradiance, and depending on the wave's frequency, Alfv\'en waves enhance or suppress the Poynting flux in the BZ process. This unified framework for the BZ process and the Alfv\'enic superradiance would offer a valuable perspective for understanding the energy sources of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>A real-time search for Type Ia Supernovae with late-time CSM interaction in ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor systems and the mechanisms that lead up to their explosions are still widely debated. In rare cases the SN ejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the progenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN explosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start. If the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of months to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up anymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it happens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between 13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time rebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Flagged candidates were rapidly followed up with photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the late-time excess and its position. We report the discovery of a $\sim50$ day rebrightening event in SN 2020qxz around 1200 days after the peak of its light curve. SN 2020qxz had signs of early CSM interaction but faded from view over 2 years before its reappearance. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed 4 emission lines that faded shortly after the end of the ZTF detected rebrightening. Our best match for these emission lines are H$\beta$ (blue shifted by $\sim5900$ km s$^{-1}$) and CaII$_{\lambda8542}$, NI$_{\lambda8567}$, and KI$_{\lambda\lambda 8763, 8767}$, all blue shifted by 5100 km s$^{-1}$ (although we note that these identifications are uncertain). This shows that catching and following up on late-time interactions as they occur can give new clues about the nature of the progenitor systems that produce these SNe by putting constraints on the possible type of donor star, and the only way to do this systematically is to use large sky surveys such as ZTF to monitor a large sample of objects.</description>

      <title>Polarization of reflected X-ray emission from Sgr A molecular complex: multiple flares, multiple sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended X-ray emission observed in the direction of several molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits spectral and temporal properties consistent with the `X-ray echo' scenario. It postulates that the observed signal is a light-travel-time delayed reflection of a short ($\delta t&lt;$1.5 yr) and bright ($L_{\rm X}&gt;10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) flare, most probably produced a few hundred years ago by Sgr A*. This scenario also predicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum, with the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction towards the primary source and polarization degree (PD) being determined by the scattering angle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently brightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the previous polarization measurement for a large region encompassing Sgr A complex with higher significance, but also reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern for the brightest reflection region in its center. X-ray polarization from this region is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A* illumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could indicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout the CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source could be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown source located in the closer vicinity of the illuminated cloud, potentially lowering the required luminosity of the primary source. Although significantly deeper observations with IXPE would be required to unequivocally distinguish between the scenarios, a combination of high-resolution imaging and micro-calorimetric spectroscopy offers an additional promising path forward.</description>

      <title>A semi-coherent search for optical pulsations from Scorpius X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of semi-coherent strategies in the search for optical pulsations from binary systems, which resulted in the tightest constraints on pulsations from Sco X-1. We analysed observations from the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the TNG spread across four years, for a total of $\sim$56 ks divided in two datasets. The great efficiency of semi-coherent techniques when only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available allowed us to set an upper limit at $9.23 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in pulsed amplitude for this source, improving on previous results by a factor of 4. Reaching the same upper limit with fully coherent searches would have required a number of trials more than two orders of magnitude larger. We also applied the same algorithm to an optical observation of a system containing a known pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, ignoring the refined knowledge of the orbital parameters that was allowed by the identification of the pulsar itself in the radio band: through this analysis, we proved that detection of the pulsar would have followed even with data in the optical band alone.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve View of Abell 2319: Turbulence, Sloshing, and ICM Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from XRISM/Resolve observations of the core of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319, focusing on its kinematic properties. The intracluster medium (ICM) exhibits temperatures of approximately 8 keV across the core, with a prominent cold front and a high-temperature region ($\sim$11 keV) in the northwest. The average gas velocity in the 3 arcmin $\times$ 4 arcmin region around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) covered by two Resolve pointings is consistent with that of the BCG to within 40 km s$^{-1}$ and we found modest average velocity dispersion of 230-250 km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, spatially-resolved spectroscopy reveals interesting variations. A blueshift of up to $\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ is observed around the east edge of the cold front, where the gas with the lowest specific entropy is found. The region further south inside the cold front shows only a small velocity difference from the BCG; however, its velocity dispersion is enhanced to 400 km s$^{-1}$, implying the development of turbulence. These characteristics indicate that we are observing sloshing motion with some inclination angle following BCG and that gas phases with different specific entropy participate in sloshing with their own velocities, as expected from simulations. No significant evidence for a high-redshift ICM component associated with the subcluster Abell 2319B was found in the region covered by the current Resolve pointings. These results highlight the importance of sloshing and turbulence in shaping the internal structure of Abell 2319. Further deep observations are necessary to better understand the mixing and turbulent processes within the cluster.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in the group-centric elliptical galaxy NGC 5813</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) is observed to be correlated with the current star formation rate in late-type galaxies and with the stellar mass in early-type galaxies (ETGs). Since there is very little gas, dust or star formation in ETGs, it has been suggested that most of the ULXs associated with them could be high luminosity Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) or foreground/background sources. It has been reported that NGC 5813, the central dominant (cD) galaxy in the NGC 5846 group of galaxies, which shows signs of a possible recent merger event, has an unusually high number of ULXs. We have undertaken a multi-epoch spectral study of the persistent ULXs in the galaxy using Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. Of the eight ULXs reported elsewhere, four have been re-identified, two are not consistently detected across all nine Chandra observations, and two are found to be foreground sources. One new persistent ULX has been identified. We present a spectral analysis of the five ULXs with luminosity consistently greater than $10^{39}$ erg/s in nine Chandra-ACIS observations, and assess their variability, adding data from XMM-Newton. The association of these ULXs with globular clusters was examined: we find one ULX lying within the field of an HST observation within 0.1$^\prime$ of the centre of a globular cluster. Optical and UV counterparts are found for another ULX. One of the ULXs is found to be variable over the time scale of days, but there is no unambiguous evidence of longer-term variability for the remaining ULXs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of the analysis of the NEVOD-DECOR data on the study of inclined muon bundles (with zenith angles from 40 to 85 degrees) of cosmic rays for the period from 2012 to 2023 are presented. An original method for studying the muon component of extensive air showers, local muon density spectra, was used. The data are compared with the calculations based on the simulation of air showers using the CORSIKA program for different models of hadronic interactions. The estimates of the energy spectrum and the behavior of the mass composition of primary cosmic rays in a wide energy range from 2 PeV to 3 EeV were obtained. They are compared with the data of other experiments.</description>

      <title>A Deep VLA Search for a Persistent Radio Counterpart to the One-off FRB 20250316A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20250316A, detected by CHIME on 2025 March 16 with a fluence of $1.7\pm0.1~\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$ and a dispersion measure of $161.3\pm0.4~\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$, ranks among the brightest extragalactic FRBs at $\sim 40$ Mpc. We obtained deep Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array follow-up at 15~GHz on 2025 April 5 and 9 and find no persistent radio source (PRS). Our best image reaches an rms of $2.8~\mu\mathrm{Jy\,beam^{-1}}$, yielding a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $&lt;8.4~\mu\mathrm{Jy}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\nu L_\nu &lt; 2.4\times10^{35}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. These results represent among the most stringent constraints for a non-repeating FRB, lying $\gtrsim 3$ orders of magnitude below the $\nu L_\nu$ of compact persistent radio sources around well-studied repeaters, thereby disfavoring bright magnetar-nebula scenarios and pointing to low-density, weakly magnetized environments. Interpreting our limit through pulsar-/magnetar-wind synchrotron frameworks places joint constraints on ambient density and engine power. If the empirical PRS--rotation-measure trend reported for repeaters extends to one-off sources, our limit implies $\vert \mathrm{RM} \vert \lesssim 30~\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$, consistent with a clean magneto-ionic sight line and progenitor channels such as neutron-star mergers or giant flares from older magnetars.</description>

      <title>Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. Whereas it is shown that the angular momentum accretion rate vanishes exactly, it is found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetric Dark Matter from Neutron Star Capture and Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a conserved particle$-$antiparticle number, $n_\chi-n_{\tilde \chi}$, and the asymmetry in the cosmological abundance $n_\chi\neq n_{\tilde \chi}$, are known to be challenged by the existence of old neutron stars (NSs), as the sufficient accumulation of DM will lead to the collapse of NSs into black holes. We demonstrate that the applicability of these constraints is much wider and covers models with symmetric populations of DM, $n_\chi = n_{\tilde \chi}$, as the process of DM capture regulated by a nucleon-DM scattering can be inherently asymmetric, $\sigma_{\chi n}\neq \sigma_{\tilde\chi n}$. The asymmetry is induced by the interference of different types of $\chi$-$n$ interactions, provided that their combination is odd under charge conjugation in the DM sector, $C_\chi$, and even under combined parity $P_{\chi + n}$. We provide a complete analysis of DM-nucleon bilinear $\chi$-$n$ interactions and find that this asymmetry is very generic. Using canonical NS parameters and local DM halo inputs, we exclude spin-averaged scattering cross sections down to $\sigma_{n\chi}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-46}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$ at DM mass $m_\chi\!\lesssim\!10^{10}\,{\rm GeV}$ for the maximally asymmetric capture rate, and show that the constraints persist down to very small values of the cross-section asymmetry, ${\cal A}=(\sigma_{\chi n}- \sigma_{\tilde\chi n})/(\sigma_{\chi n}+ \sigma_{\tilde\chi n})\gtrsim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes with an effective-one-body template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs) covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5 with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline. Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without using templates.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, particularly those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$ in the probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, and rewrite their likelihood convolution to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields a constraint of $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.812_{-0.258}^{+0.250}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.460}^{+6.754}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us to better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.</description>

      <title>Search for Nonthermal X-ray Emission in the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of our study of the X-ray emission from the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster based on INTEGRAL/IBIS data in the energy range 20-120 keV. Our goal is the search for a nonthermal emission component from the cluster. Using the INTEGRAL data over the period of observations 2003-2009, we have constructed the images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster in different energy bands from 20 to 120 keV with the extraction of spectral information. We show that in the hard X-ray energy band the source is an extended one with an angular size of 4.9 +/- 0.1 arcmins. Assuming a fixed intracluster gas temperature of 8.5 keV, a power-law component of the possible nonthermal X-ray emission is observed at a 5.5 sigma significance level, the flux from which is consistent with previous studies. However, in view of the uncertainty in constraining the thermal emission component in the X-ray spectrum at energies above 20 keV, we cannot assert that the nonthermal emission of the cluster has been significantly detected. Based on the fact of a confident detection of the cluster up to 70 keV, we can draw the conclusion only about the possible presence of a nonthermal excess at energies above 60 keV.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB/Pulsar discovery of a nearby long period radio transient with a timing glitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a 421 s long period radio transient (LPT) using the CHIME telescope, CHIME J0630+25. The source is localized to RA=06:30:38.4$\pm1'$ Dec=25:26:24$\pm1'$ using voltage data acquired with the CHIME baseband system. A timing analysis shows that a model including a glitch is preferred over a non-glitch model with $dF/F=1.3\times10^{-6}$, consistent with other glitching neutron stars. The timing model suggests a surface magnetic field of $\sim1.5\times10^{15}$ G and a characteristic age of $\sim1.28\times10^{6}$ yrs. A separate line of evidence to support a strong local magnetic field is an abnormally high rotation measure of $RM=-347.8(6) \mathrm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ relative to CHIME J0630+25's modest dispersion measure of 22(1) pc cm$^{-2}$, implying a dense local magneto-ionic structure. As a result, we believe that CHIME J0630+25 is a magnetized, slowly spinning, isolated neutron star. This marks CHIME J0630+25 as the longest period neutron star and the second long period neutron star with an inferred magnetar-like field. Based on dispersion measure models and comparison with pulsars with distance measurements, CHIME J0630+25 is located at a nearby distance of 170$^{+310}_{-100}$ pc (95.4\%), making it an ideal candidate for follow-up studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Constraints on the Flux of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino event by the KM3NeT telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. A photopion interaction origin of the neutrino requires a parent cosmic-ray energy of $\gtrsim4$~EeV per nucleon. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, i.e., a transient point source, diffuse astrophysical emission, and a line-of-sight interaction of an ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR; $E\gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transients that is energetic, $\gamma$-ray dark, and more abundant than the known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger, across various source redshift evolution models. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit considering the source evolution up to high values of redshift, while the joint fit remains viable for sources contributing up to a maximum redshift $z_{\rm max} \gtrsim 1$ for the limiting case of photopion interaction efficiency, $f_{p\gamma} = 0.1$. For a cosmogenic origin from point sources, the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of $\sim10^9 M_\odot$ black holes in active galactic nuclei, assuming a proton composition and optimistic values of extragalactic magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in Realistic Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive black hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW) detection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current Bayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by modeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated binary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these datasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), matched filter detection statistic, and reduced log-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the injected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection fractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors &gt; 10 favoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at an S/N = 4.6. Source confusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false detections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations consistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of these CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 and 10.8 nHz), with 95th percentile regions spanning 4-12nHz frequencies, 0.7-20$\times10^9 M_\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and 18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful detections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the chirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower than 1 dex.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This work investigates the Lorentz-gauge formulation of gravity-a novel framework that addresses key conceptual challenges in quantum gravity and cosmology by leveraging the recent black hole solutions presented in Ref. \cite{Koivisto:2024asr}. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, the potential of water Cherenkov detectors equipped with multi-PMT modules for background-free upward-going neutrino detection and improved direction reconstruction is demonstrated. By analyzing signal time traces with transformer-based models, significant improvements in angular resolution are achieved compared to previous designs with larger PMTs. These detectors enable the reconstruction of neutrino directions with resolutions of approximately $10^\circ$ in azimuth and $7^\circ$ in zenith for high-signal events, corresponding to an overall opening angle of approximately $10^\circ$. This design reduces saturation effects and enhances directional sensitivity, particularly for high-energy neutrinos. The results highlight the potential of WCD arrays as complementary tools for neutrino astronomy, particularly in the context of multimessenger observations of transient astrophysical sources. The nearly continuous operation and wide field of view of these detectors further enhance their suitability for real-time monitoring and alert generation.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in 0313-192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc (projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim 610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$), and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas. Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet formation beyond traditional models.</description>
