      <title>Curvelet-Regularized SPDE Inversion on Piecewise-Planar Fractures with Trace-Graph Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a sparse-to-dense reconstruction layer for fractured media in which sparse point measurements are mapped onto piecewise-planar fracture supports inferred from 3D trace polylines. Each plane is discretized in local coordinates and estimated via a convex objective that combines a grid SPDE/GMRF quadratic prior with an $\ell_1$ penalty on undecimated discrete curvelet coefficients, targeting anisotropic, fracture-aligned structure that is poorly represented by isotropic smoothness alone. We further define an along-fracture distance through trace-network geodesics and express connectivity-driven regularization as a quadratic form $z^\top P^\top L_G P z$, where $L_G$ is a graph Laplacian on the trace network and $P$ maps plane grids to graph nodes; plane intersections are handled by linear consistency constraints sampled along intersection lines. The resulting optimization admits efficient splitting: sparse linear solves for the quadratic block and coefficient-wise shrinkage for the curvelet block, with standard ADMM convergence under convexity. We specify reproducible synthetic benchmarks, baselines, ablations, and sensitivity studies that isolate directional sparsity and connectivity effects, and provide reference code to generate the figures and quantitative tables.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanical Model of Sediment Transport Capacity and Scour-and-Silt volume in Wide and Shallow Rivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a universal, parameter-free model for sediment transport and riverbed evolution using a rigorous statistical physics framework. It seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional deterministic and empirical approaches by establishing formulas with general applicability. The river channel is conceptualized as an isothermal-isobaric ensemble containing numerous non-identical sediment particles. The macroscopic state of the system, defined by the scour-and-silt volume, is derived from the statistical mechanics of particle distributions. The Gibbs free energy and partition function for the ensemble are formulated, considering the two primary states of particles (suspended load and bed load) and the transitions between them. This theoretical framework yields a universal formula for the number of particles in transport and the consequent volumetric change. The model was applied to six reaches of the Lower Yellow River from 2000-2001. Calculations revealed a seasonal pattern in the number of transported particles, higher in winter and lower in summer. The results showed an alternation between scour (January-July) and siltation (July-January), with a net scour volume over the 24-month period. The magnitude of scour-and-silt volume decreased from upstream to downstream, findings that are consistent with independent observational records following the operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. The model successfully simulates riverbed evolution without empirical parameters, demonstrating that statistical physics provides a robust framework for predicting complex fluvial processes. Its general formulation suggests potential applicability to other similar multi-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Melting dynamics and mixing layer growth near the ice-ocean interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice melting into saline water plays a fundamental role in the dynamics near the ice-ocean interface in polar oceans. The physics of ice melting involves a non-trivial interplay between thermodynamics at the interface, hydrodynamic transport in the bulk and the properties of the ambient ocean. The key control parameters are the density ratio $R_\rho$ proportional to the ambient ocean salinity and the Lewis number $Le = \kappa_T/\kappa_S$, which compares the thermal and salt diffusivities. Increasing the salinity is known to slow down melting, with the melt rate transitioning from subdiffusive to diffusive as $R_\rho$ increases. Here, we ssess the role of turbulence in this transition, using highly-resolved numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a slowly melting upper boundary. We analyse the non-stationary growth of the temperature and meltwater mixing layers, varying the Lewis number and the density ratio. While meltwater is continuously entrained by convection inside the bulk, we identify a transition from convection to diffusion close to the interface. This transition is reflected by the formation of an interfacial boundary layer that regulates the flux of meltwater pouring into the turbulent bulk for $R_\rho \gtrsim 10$. Using mixing-layer diagnostics based on meltwater-concentration thresholds, we observe that the turbulent layer grows super-diffusively $\propto t^{1.33}$, while the interfacial boundary layer expands diffusively $\propto t^{0.5}$ but with a non-universal prefactor. These results indicate that double-diffusive effects are here confined to the interface, and highlight potential limitations of diagnostics based on fixed concentration thresholds in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>
