      <title>Off-center ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anti-correlation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 days. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-center ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behavior expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few percent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-Driven Neutron-Rich Ejecta Unleashed: Global 3D Neutrino-GRMHD Simulations of Collapsars Reveal the Conditions for r-process Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collapsars - rapidly rotating stellar cores that form black holes (BHs) - can power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and are proposed to be key contributors to the production of heavy elements in the Universe via the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Previous neutrino-transport collapsar simulations have been unable to unbind neutron-rich material from the disk. However, these simulations have not included magnetic fields or the BH, both of which are essential for launching mass outflows. We present $\nu$H-AMR, a novel neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ($\nu$GRMHD) code, which we use to perform the first 3D $\nu$GRMHD collapsar simulations. We find a self-consistent formation of a disk with initially weak magnetic flux, resulting in a low accretion speed and leaving sufficient time for the disk to neutronize. However, once substantial magnetic flux accumulates near the BH, it becomes dynamically important, leading to a magnetically arrested disk that unbinds some of the neutron-rich material. The strong flux also accelerates the accretion speed, preventing further disk neutronization. The neutron-rich disk ejecta collides with the infalling stellar gas, generating a shocked cocoon with an electron fraction, $Y_\text{e}\gtrsim0.2$. Continuous mixing between the cocoon and neutron-poor stellar gas incrementally raises the outflow $Y_\text{e}$, but the final $r$-process yield is determined earlier at the point of neutron capture freeze-out. Our models require extreme magnetic fluxes and mass accretion rates to eject neutron-rich material ($Y_\text{e}\lesssim0.3$), implying very high $r$-process ejecta masses $M_\text{ej}\lesssim{}M_\odot$. Future work will explore under what conditions more typical collapsar engines become $r$-process factories.</description>

      <title>First-principles measurement of ion and electron energization in collisionless accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest 3D Particle-in-Cell shearing-box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability, for the first time employing the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio. We investigate the energy partition between relativistically hot electrons and subrelativistic ions in turbulent accretion flows, a regime relevant to collisionless, radiatively inefficient accretion flows of supermassive black holes, such as those targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope. We provide a simple empirical formula to describe the measured heating ratio between ions and electrons, which can be used for more accurate global modeling of accretion flows with standard fluid approaches such as general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Black hole spin evolution across cosmic time from the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes (BHs) have two fundamental properties: mass and spin. While the mass-evolution of BHs has been extensively studied, much less work has been done on predicting the distribution of BH spins. In this paper we present the spin evolution for a sample of intermediate-mass and massive BHs from the newHorizon simulation, which evolved BH spin across cosmic time in a full cosmological context through gas accretion, BH-BH mergers and BH feedback including jet spindown. As BHs grow, their spin evolution alternates between being dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers. Massive BHs are generally highly spinning.Accounting for the spin energy extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism increases the scatter in BH spins, especially in the mass range $10^{5-7} \rm \ M_\odot$, where BHs had previously been predicted to be almost universally maximally spinning. We find no evidence for spin-down through efficient chaotic accretion. As a result of their high spin values, massive BHs have an average radiative efficiency of $&lt;\varepsilon_{\rm r}^{\rm thin}&gt; \approx 0.19$. As BHs spend much of their time at low redshift with a radiatively inefficient thick disc, BHs in our sample remain hard to observe. Different observational methods probe different sub-populations of BHs, significantly influencing the observed distribution of spins. Generally, X-ray-based methods and higher luminosity cuts increase the average observed BH spin. When taking BH spin evolution into account, BHs inject on average between 3 times (in quasar mode) and 8 times (in radio mode) as much feedback energy into their host galaxy as previously assumed.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Characterization of the Obscuring Medium at the Center of NGC 6300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the super-massive black holes in the Universe accrete material in an obscured phase. While it is commonly accepted that the "dusty torus" is responsible for the nuclear obscuration, its geometrical, physical, and chemical properties are far from being properly understood. In this paper, we take advantage of the multiple X-ray observations taken between 2007 and 2020, as well as of optical to far infra-red (FIR) observations of NGC 6300, a nearby ($z=0.0037$) Seyfert 2 galaxy. The goal of this project is to study the nuclear emission and the properties of the obscuring medium, through a multi-wavelength study conducted from X-ray to IR. We perform a simultaneous X-ray spectral fitting and optical-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to investigate the obscuring torus. For the X-ray spectral fitting, physically motivated torus models, such as borus02, UXClumpy and XClumpy are used. The SED fitting is done using XCIGALE. Through joint analysis, we constrain the physical parameters of the torus and the emission properties of the accreting supermassive black hole. Through X-ray observations taken in the last 13 years, we have not found any significant line-of-sight column density variability for this source, but observed the X-ray flux dropping $\sim40-50\%$ in 2020 with respect to previous observations. The UXClumpy model predicts the presence of an inner ring of Compton-thick gaseous medium, responsible for the reflection dominated spectra above 10 keV. Through multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure an Eddington accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}\sim2\times10^{-3}$, which falls in the range of the radiatively inefficient accretion solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first images of the black holes in Sagittarius A* and M87* have created a wide range of new scientific opportunities in gravitational physics, compact objects, and relativistic astrophysics. We discuss here the scientific opportunities that arise from the rich data sets that have already been obtained and the new data sets that will be obtained, exploiting a wide range of technical advances, including observational agility, receiver upgrades, and the addition of new stations. This document provides a 5-year framework for Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) science structured around four fundamental questions that are used to prioritize the analysis of existing data, guide technical upgrades, and determine the optimal use of future observational opportunities with EHT, ALMA, and multi-wavelength facilities. Through enhancements over this period, the EHT will create the first movie of M87* connecting black hole and jet physics, provide detailed studies of the structure and dynamics of Sgr A*, characterize the magnetospheres of both systems through polarimetric imaging, and explore the spacetime properties of black holes with greater precision and range.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Origin of FRB-associated X-ray Bursts with X-ray Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of extraordinary X-ray burst (XRB) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB) like FRB 20200428D is still unclear, though several models such as the emission of a trapped fireball modified by resonant cyclotron scattering, the outflow from a polar trapped-expanding fireball, and the synchrotron radiation of a far-away relativistic shock, have been proposed. To determine which model is true, we study possible X-ray polarization signature for each model, inspired by the importance of radio polarization in identifying FRB origin. We first numerically simulate or calculate the XRB spectrum for each model and fit it to the observed data, then compute the corresponding polarization signal based on the fit. We find that these three models predict different polarization patterns in terms of phase/time and energy variations. The differences can be used to test the models with future X-ray polarization observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves associated with the r-mode instability from neutron star-white dwarf mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) binaries evolve into either ultra-compact X-ray binaries undergoing stable mass transfer or direct mergers by unstable mass transfer. While much attention has been on gravitational wave (GW) emissions from NS-WD binaries with the former evolutionary pathway, this work explores GW emissions related to {\em r}-mode instability of the accreting NSs in NS-WD mergers particularly with WD's mass $\gtrsim 1M_{\odot}$. Due to considerably high accretion rates, the GW emissions associated with both {\em r}-modes and magnetic deformation intrinsically induced by {\em r}-modes presented in this work are much stronger than those in NS-WD binaries categorized as intermediate-mass or low-mass X-ray binaries, rendering them interesting sources for the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and upcoming Einstein Telescope. Moreover, these strong GW emissions might accompany some intriguing electromagnetic emissions such as peculiar long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), fast blue optical transients including kilonova-like emissions associated with peculiar LGRBs, and/or fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Probing Magnetic Fields in Young Supernova Remnants with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron emission from the shocked regions in supernova remnants provides, through its polarization, crucial details about the magnetic field strength and orientation in these regions. This, in turn, provides information on particle acceleration in these shocks. Due to the rapid losses of the highest-energy relativistic electrons, X-ray polarization measurements allow for investigations of the magnetic field to be carried outvery close to the sites of particle acceleration. Measurements of both the geometry of the field and the levels of turbulence implied by the observed polarization degree thus provide unique insights into the conditions leading to efficient particle acceleration in fast shocks. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has carried out observations of multiple young SNRs, including Cas A, Tycho, SN 1006, and RX J1713.7-3946. In each, significant X-ray polarization detections provide measurements of magnetic field properties that show some common behavior but also considerable differences between these SNRs. Here, we provide a summary of results from IXPE studies of young SNRs, providing comparisons between the observed polarization and the physical properties of the remnants and their environments.</description>

      <title>Sharp Periodic Flares and Long-Term Variability in the High-Mass X-ray Binary XTE J1829-098 from RXTE PCA, Swift BAT and MAXI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XTE J1829-098 is a transient X-ray pulsar with a period of ~7.8 s. It is a candidate Be star system, although the evidence for this is not yet definitive. We investigated the twenty-year long X-ray light curve using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array (PCA), Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). We find that all three light curves are clearly modulated on the ~244 day orbital period previously reported from PCA monitoring observations, with outbursts confined to a narrow phase range. The light curves also show that XTE J1829-098 was in an inactive state between approximately December 2008 and April 2018 and no strong outbursts occurred. Such behavior is typical of Be X-ray binary systems, with the absence of outbursts likely related to the dissipation of the Be star's decretion disk. The mean outburst shapes can be approximated with a triangular profile and, from a joint fit of this to all three light curves, we refine the orbital period to 243.95 +/- 0.04 days. The mean outburst profile does not show any asymmetry and has a total phase duration of 0.140 +/- 0.007. However, the PCA light curve shows that there is considerable cycle-to-cycle variability of the individual outbursts. We compare the properties of XTE J1829-098 with other sources that show short phase-duration outbursts, in particular GS 1843-02 (2S 1845-024) which has a very similar orbital period, but longer pulse period, and whose orbit is known to be highly eccentric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>LOFAR high-band antenna observations of the Perseus cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perseus cluster is the brightest X-ray cluster in the sky and is known as a cool-core galaxy cluster. Being a very nearby cluster, it has been extensively studied. This has provided a comprehensive view of the physical processes that operate in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from the AGN 3C84 and measurements of ICM turbulence. Additionally, the Perseus cluster contains a central radio mini-halo. This diffuse radio source traces cosmic ray electrons (re-)accelerated in-situ in the ICM.
  Here we report on LOFAR high-band antenna 120-168 MHz observations of the Perseus cluster that probe a range of four orders of magnitude in angular scales. In our 0.3 arcsec resolution image, we find that the northern extension of the 3C84 lobe consists of several narrow 1.5-3 kpc parallel strands of emission. In addition, we detect steep-spectrum filaments associated with a previous outburst of the central AGN radio emission filling two known X-ray ghost cavities. At 7 arcsec resolution, our images show a complex structured radio mini-halo, with several edges and filaments. At resolutions of 26 arcsec and 80 arcsec, we discover diffuse radio emission with a 1.1 Mpc extent. We classify this emission as a giant radio halo and its properties are distinct from the inner mini-halo. We also detect two diffuse sources at projected cluster centric radii of 0.7 and 1.0 Mpc. Finally, we observe a 0.9 Mpc long trail of radio emission from the cluster member galaxy IC310, connecting it with the giant radio halo. Together with other recent studies of relaxed clusters, our LOFAR observations indicate that cluster-wide radio emission could be (more) common in cool-core clusters. In the case of the Perseus cluster, a past off-axis merger event that preserved the cool core might have generated enough turbulence to produce an extended radio halo observable at low frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. T\.ZOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for T\.ZO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not T\.ZOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of T\.ZOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of T\.ZOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of T\.ZO theory to recent progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Hooks, Lines, and Sinkers: How AGN Feedback and Cosmic-Ray Transport shape the Far Infrared-Radio Correlation of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-infrared (FIR) - radio correlation (FRC) is one of the most promising empirical constraints on the role of cosmic-rays (CRs) and magnetic fields (\textbf{B}) in galaxy formation and evolution. While many theories have been proposed in order to explain the emergence and maintenance of the FRC across a gamut of galaxy properties and redshift, the non-linear physics at play remain unexplored in full complexity and cosmological context. We present the first reproduction of the $z \sim 0$ FRC using detailed synthetic observations of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE-3 suite with explicitly-evolved CR proton and electron (CRe) spectra, for three models for CR transport and multi-channel AGN feedback. In doing so, we generally verify the predictions of `calorimeter' theories at high FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\gtrsim$ 10$^{9.5}$) and at low FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\lesssim$ 10$^{9.5}$) the so-called `conspiracy' of increasing ultraviolet radiation escape in tandem with increasing CRe escape, and find that the global FRC is insensitive to \textit{orders-of-magnitude} locally-variable CR transport coefficients. Importantly, the indirect effect of AGN feedback on emergent observables highlights novel interpretations of outliers in the FRC. In particular, we find that in many cases, `radio-excess' objects can be better understood as \textit{IR-dim} objects with longer-lived radio contributions at low $z$ from Type Ia SNe and intermittent black hole accretion in quenching galaxies, though this is sensitive to the interplay of CR transport and AGN feedback physics. This creates characteristic evolutionary tracks leading to the $z=0$ FRC, which shape the subsequent late-time behavior of each model.</description>

      <title>DRAFTS: A Deep Learning-Based Radio Fast Transient Search Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in radio astronomy is a complex task due to the challenges posed by radio frequency interference (RFI) and signal dispersion in the interstellar medium. Traditional search algorithms are often inefficient, time-consuming, and generate a high number of false positives. In this paper, we present DRAFTS, a deep learning-based radio fast transient search pipeline. DRAFTS integrates object detection and binary classification techniques to accurately identify FRBs in radio data. We developed a large, real-world dataset of FRBs for training deep learning models. The search test on FAST real observation data demonstrates that DRAFTS performs exceptionally in terms of accuracy, completeness, and search speed. In the re-search of FRB 20190520B observation data, DRAFTS detected more than three times the number of bursts compared to Heimdall, highlighting the potential for future FRB detection and analysis.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>

      <title>Inter--disks inversion surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a counter--rotating torus orbiting a central Kerr black hole (\textbf{BH}) with dimensionless spin $a$, and its accretion flow into the \textbf{BH}, in an agglomerate of an outer counter--rotating torus and an inner co--rotating torus. This work focus is the analysis of the inter--disks inversion surfaces. Inversion surfaces are spacetime surfaces, defined by the condition $u^{\phi}=0$ on the flow torodial velocity, located out of the \textbf{BH} ergoregion, and totally embedding the \textbf{BH}. They emerge as a necessary condition, related to the spacetime frame--dragging, for the counter--rotating flows into the central Kerr \textbf{BH}. In our analysis we study the inversion surfaces of the Kerr spacetimes for the counter--rotating flow from the outer torus, impacting on the inner co--rotating disk. Being totally or partially embedded in (internal to) the inversion surfaces, the inner co--rotating torus (or jet) could be totally or in part ``shielded", respectively, from the impact with flow with $a u^{\phi}&lt;0$. We prove that, in general, in the spacetimes with $a&lt;0.551$ the co--rotating toroids are always external to the accretion flows inversion surfaces. For $0.551&lt;a&lt;0.886$, co--rotating toroids could be partially internal (with the disk inner region, including the inner edge) in the flow inversion surface. For \textbf{BHs} with $a&gt;0.886$, a co--rotating torus could be entirely embedded in the inversion surface and, for larger spins, it is internal to the inversion surfaces. Tori orbiting in the \textbf{BH} outer ergoregion are a particular case. Further constraints on the \textbf{BHs} spins are discussed in the article.</description>

      <title>A long-duration superflare on the K giant HD 251108</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many giant stars are magnetically active, which causes rotational variability, chromospheric emission lines, and X-ray emission. Large outbursts in these emission features can set limits on the magnetic field strength and thus constrain the mechanism of the underlying dynamo. HD~251108 is a Li-rich active K-type giant. We find a rotational period of 21.3~d with color changes and additional long-term photometric variability. Both can be explained with very stable stellar spots. We followed the decay phase of a superflare for 28 days with NICER and from the ground. We track the flare decay in unprecedented detail in several coronal temperature components. With a peak flux around $10^{34}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (0.5-4.0~keV) and an exponential decay time of 2.2~days in the early decay phase, this is one of the strongest flares ever observed; yet it follows trends established from samples of smaller flares, for example for the relations between H$\alpha$ and X-ray flux, indicating that the physical process that powers the flare emission is consistent over a large range of flare energies. We estimate a flare loop length about 2-4 times the stellar radius. No evidence is seen for abundance changes during the flare.</description>

      <title>An unidentified Fermi source emitting radio bursts in the Galactic bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the detection of radio bursts from the Galactic bulge using the real-time transient detection and localization system, realfast. The pulses were detected commensally on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array during a survey of unidentified Fermi $\gamma$-ray sources. The bursts were localized to subarcsecond precision using realfast fast-sampled imaging. Follow-up observations with the Green Bank Telescope detected additional bursts from the same source. The bursts do not exhibit periodicity in a search up to periods of 480 s, assuming a duty cycle of &lt; 20%. The pulses are nearly 100% linearly polarized, showing circular polarization up to 12%, and exhibit variable scattering on timescales of months. The arcsecond-level realfast localization links the source confidently with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray source and places it nearby (though not coincident with) an XMM-Newton X-ray source. Based on the source's overall properties, we discuss various options for the nature of this object and propose that it could be a young pulsar, a magnetar, or a binary pulsar system.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Classification and Parameter Inference of Rotational Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test deep-learning (DL) techniques for the analysis of rotational core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW) signals by performing classification and parameter inference of the maximum (peak) frequency and the GW strain amplitude ($\Delta h$) multiplied by the luminosity distance ($D$) attained at core bounce, respectively, $(f_{peak})$ and $(D \cdot \Delta h)$. Our datasets are built from a catalog of numerically generated CCSN waveforms assembled by Richers et al. 2017. Those waveforms are injected into noise from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and Advanced Virgo detectors corresponding to the O2 and O3a observing runs. For a network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 5, our classification network using time series detects Galactic CCSN GW signals buried in detector noise with a false positive rate of 0.10% and a 98% accuracy, being able to detect all signals with SNR&gt;10. The inference of $f_{peak}$ is more accurate than for $D \cdot \Delta h $, particularly for our datasets with the shortest time window (0.25 s) and for a minimum SNR=15. From the calibration plots of predicted versus true values of the two parameters, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the slope deviation with respect to the ideal value are computed. We find $\sigma_{D \cdot \Delta h} = 52.6$ cm and $\sigma_{f_{peak}} = 18.3$ Hz, with respective slope deviations of 11.6% and 8.3%. Our best model is also tested on waveforms from a recent CCSN catalog built by Mitra et al. 2023, different from the one used for the training. For these new waveforms, the true values of the two parameters are mostly within the $1\sigma$ band around the network's predicted values. Our results show that DL techniques hold promise to infer physical parameters of Galactic rotational CCSN events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum across the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The all-particle spectrum of cosmic rays measured at Earth has a knee-like feature around 4 PeV. A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature specific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic property of the Galactic cosmic-ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray and cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In order to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectrum and composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the all-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We calculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and find that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux disagrees with the LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the 10-100 TeV energy range in the inner and outer Galaxy. We determine the break energy in the CR spectrum expected from these gamma-ray data and find it an energy ten times lower than obtained from local measurements.</description>

Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.05\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

      <title>Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC): A Tool for Retrieving and Modeling Multi-temporal, Multi-wavelength and Multi-messenger Data from Blazar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC) is a web-based tool designed for accessing and retrieving multiwavelength and multimessenger data from blazar observations. MMDC facilitates the construction and interactive visualization of time-resolved multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars by integrating: \textit{(i)} archival data from over 80 catalogs and databases, \textit{(ii)} optical data from all-sky survey facilities such as ASAS-SN, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS, and \textit{(iii)} newly analyzed datasets in the optical/UV band from \textit{Swift}-UVOT, in the X-ray band from \textit{Swift}-XRT and NuSTAR observations, and the high-energy $\gamma$-ray band from \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations. MMDC distinguishes itself from other online platforms by the large quantity of available data. For instance, it includes data from all blazar observations by \textit{Swift} and NuSTAR, as well as the results of detailed spectral analysis in the $\gamma$-ray band during different emission states, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. Another important distinguishing feature of MMDC is its ability to enable precise, self-consistent theoretical modeling of the observed data using machine learning algorithms trained on leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, which consider the injection of particles and all relevant cooling processes. MMDC is an innovative tool which significantly enhances blazar research by providing a comprehensive framework for data accessibility, analysis, and theoretical interpretation, thereby advancing our understanding of blazar emissions and the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Evolution of the Hot Gas in Normal Galaxies from the Near Universe to z=0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the ~107 degree hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z &lt; 0.6 detected in five high galactic latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ~400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit co-moving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (~5s) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6-10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS~1041 erg s-1 galaxies at higher z, suggests that high z, moderate LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without AGN feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent SFR.</description>

      <title>MAGICS III. Seeds sink swiftly: nuclear star clusters dramatically accelerate seed black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger rate predictions of Massive Black Hole (MBH) seeds from large-scale cosmological simulations differ widely, with recent studies highlighting the challenge of low-mass MBH seeds failing to reach the galactic center, a phenomenon known as the seed sinking problem. In this work, we tackle this issue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations from the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution $N$-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that only MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we extend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our models. Utilizing $N$-body resimulations with up to $10^7$ particles, we demonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic environment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions, significantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This process leads to the formation of a hard binary in $\lesssim 500$ Myr after the onset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in 8 out of 12 models, the high stellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating gravitational wave (GW) mergers by redshift $z = 4$. We conclude that at $z &gt; 4$, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a merger rate of $0.3$--$0.6\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z = 4$, which is approximately 300--600 times higher than in non-NSC environments. In contrast, in environments without NSCs, surrounding dark matter plays a more significant role in loss-cone scattering.</description>
