      <title>Sequence Complexity and Monomer Rigidity Control the Morphologies and Aging Dynamics of Protein Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein aggregates exhibit diverse morphology, exemplified by amyloid fibrils, gel-like structures, and liquid-like condensates. Differences in the morphologies in identical proteins play important functional roles in several diseases. Simulations using a minimal model show that such structures are encoded in the sequence complexity and bending rigidity of the monomers. The low-complexity flexible sequences form liquid droplets, whose relaxation dynamics are ergodic. In contrast, rigid low and high-complexity sequences, which form ordered nematic fibril-like structures and amorphous aggregates, exhibit heterogenous, non-ergodic dynamics. The relaxation times under these conditions increase as the waiting time increases, which is a signature of aging. The implications of our findings for aging in intrinsically disordered proteins and repeat RNA sequences are outlined.</description>

      <title>Neon tetra fish (Paracheirodon innesi) as farm-to-optical-table Bragg reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iridophore networks in the skin of neon tetra fish are investigated for use as biologically sourced, tunable, Bragg reflector arrays. This paper reports on a method for immediate and fast post-processing of tissue to modify the structural color of iridophores found in the lateral color stripe. Conditions for fixation as well as the environment post-fixation to improve longevity of the structural color are also presented. Recent results from attempts to further increase the lifetime of post-mortem iridophore color through infiltration and embedding in low-acid glycol methacrylate are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, including linear analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply. Additionally, our results suggest that longer lifetimes in ecosystems might come at the expense of reduced populations due to limited resources.</description>

      <title>Transport and Energetics of Bacterial Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in the absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and the geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open-source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.
