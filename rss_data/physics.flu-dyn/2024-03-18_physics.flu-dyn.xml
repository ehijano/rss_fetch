      <title>Localization-delocalization transition for light particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bubbles in fluids raise to the surface due to Archimede's force. Remarkably, in turbulent flows this process is severely hindered by the presence of vortex filaments, which act as moving potential wells, dynamically trapping light particles and bubbles. Quantifying the statistical weights and roles of vortex filaments in turbulence is, however, still an outstanding experimental and computational challenge due to their small scale, fast chaotic motion, and transient nature. Here we show that, under the influence of a modulated oscillatory forcing, the collective bubble behaviour switches from a dynamically localized (insulator) to a delocalized (conductor) state. Additionally, we find that by varying the forcing frequency and amplitude, a remarkable resonant phenomenon between light particles and small-scale vortex filamenents emerges, likening particle behavior to a forced damped oscillator. We discuss how these externally actuated bubbles can be used as a new type of microscopic probes to investigate the space-time statistical properties of the smallest turbulence scales, allowing to quantitatively measure physical characteristics of vortex filaments. We develop a superposition model that is in excellent agreement with the simulation data of the particle dynamics which reveals the fraction of localized/delocalized particles as well as characteristics of the potential landscape induced by vortices in turbulence. Our approach paves the way to innovative ways to accurately measure turbulent properties and to the possibility to control light particles and bubble motions in turbulence with potential applications to wave breaking, medical imaging, drug/gene delivery, chemical reactions, wastewater treatment, and industrial mixing.</description>

      <title>Fluttering without wind: Stokesian quasiperiodic settling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid inertia imparts rich dynamics to leaves falling from trees. We show that bodies with two planes of symmetry can display a range of behaviours even without inertia. Any such body supports a conserved quantity in its dynamics, and is either a settler, a drifter or a flutterer, depending only on its shape. At large time, settlers and drifters respectively fall vertically and obliquely, while flutterers rotate forever while executing intricate patterns. The dynamics of flutterers decouples into a periodic and a Floquet part with different time scales, giving periodicity or quasiperiodicity. We design a set of bodies and use the boundary integral method to show that settlers, drifters and flutterers, all lie in this set.</description>

      <title>Capturing thin structures in VOF simulations with two-plane reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel interface reconstruction strategy for volume of fluid (VOF) methods is introduced that represents the liquid-gas interface as two planes that co-exist within a single computational cell. In comparison to the piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC), this new algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of the reconstruction, in particular when dealing with thin structures such as films. The placement of the two planes requires the solution of a non-linear optimization problem in six dimensions, which has the potential to be overly expensive. An efficient solution to this optimization problem is presented here that exploits two key ideas: an algorithm for extracting multiple plane orientations from transported surface data, and an efficient and mass-conserving distance-finding algorithm that accounts for two planes with arbitrary orientation. Additionally, a simple and robust strategy is presented to accurately represent the surface tension forces produced at the interface of subgrid-thickness films. The performance of this new VOF reconstruction is demonstrated on several test cases that illustrate the capability to handle arbitrarily thin films.</description>

      <title>Wall confinement effects on the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in thin tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation is a common phenomenon in nature and has numerous applications. In contrast to a cavitation bubble in a free domain, a cavitation bubble in a thin tube is restricted by the tube wall, which is expected to significantly affect bubble evolution but its mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the dynamics of a cavitation bubble in a thin circular tube is studied by numerical simulation, focusing on the confinement effects of the tube. The results show that besides affecting the size and lifetime of the bubble, the confinement effects of the tube lead to the generation of counter jets and a ring jet during the contraction process of the bubble, and the curvature of the two counter jets determines the ring jet's peak velocity. When the bubble deviates from the midpoint of the tube in the axial direction, the two sides of the bubble along the axial direction show asymmetric behaviors, which results in the bubble migrating toward the midpoint. The tube diameter, tube length, liquid viscosity, and initial bubble position, can significantly influence the degree of confinement effects, which can be characterized by the variations of several key indicators, such as bubble size, lifetime, degree of deformation, counter jet velocity, ring jet velocity, and axial migration of the bubble.</description>

      <title>Elasto-visco-plastic flows in benchmark geometries: I. 4 to 1 Planar Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions for the flow of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids in the 4 to 1 planar contraction geometry. The Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley fluid model is solved via the finite-volume method with the OpenFOAM software. Both the constitutive model and the solution method require using transient simulations. In this benchmark geometry, whereas viscoelastic fluids may exhibit two vortices, referred to as lip and corner vortices, we find that EVP materials are unyielded in the concave corners. They are also unyielded along the mid-plane of both channels, but not around the contraction area where all stress components are larger. When the Bingham or the Weissenberg numbers are lower than critical values, and then, a steady state is reached. When these two dimensionless numbers increase while they remain below the respective critical values, which are interdependent, (a) the unyielded regions expand and shift in the flow direction, and (b) the maximum velocity increases at the entrance of the contraction. Increasing material elasticity collaborates with increasing the yield stress, which expands the unyielded areas, because it deforms the material more prior to yielding compared to stiffer materials. Above the critical Weissenberg number, transient variations appear for longer times in all variables, including the yield surface, instead of a monotonic approach to the steady state. They may lead to oscillations which are damped or of constant amplitude or approach a flow with rather smooth path lines but complex stress field without a plane of symmetry, under creeping conditions. These patterns arise near the entrance of the narrow channel, where the curvature of the path lines is highest and its coupling with the increased elasticity triggers a purely elastic instability. Similarly, a critical value of the yield stress exists above which such phenomena are predicted.</description>

      <title>Computational Seismic Fracture Synthesis of Tidal Barrage using Enhanced Isotropic Plasticity Damage Mechanics and Coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiphase Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mega-engineered hydraulic structures like dams and barrages are critically sensitive to strong ground motion if constructed within the vicinity of triggered fault lines. Collapse post excessive deformation leads to severe environmental impact. In this study, fracture corresponding to the response of a concrete tidal barrage to strong ground motion is analyzed along with behavioral effects due to reservoir-barrage dynamic interaction. An enhanced version of the plasticity damage mechanical model, which includes effects due to degradation of elastic stiffness of concrete as well as restoration of fracture energy losses is assigned as material behavior. The fluid-structure interaction is solved using an idealized Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The proposed improvised numerical formulations are validated against benchmark simulations performed on the Koyna dam situated in Maharashtra, India and the results captured are upto 94% accurate. Finite element simulation of a tidal barrage is performed using a computationally stable mesh with global grid to length ratio of 4.2. The yield surface captured is elliptical in nature and fracture is observed to be propagating from bottom of gate housing covering upto four nodal integration points.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of non-spherical drops with a liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ three-dimensional numerical simulations to explore the impact dynamics of non-spherical drops in a deep liquid pool by varying the aspect ratios $(A_r)$ and Weber numbers $(\We)$. We observe that when a non-spherical drop is gently placed on a liquid pool, it exhibits a partial coalescence phenomenon and the emergence of a daughter droplet for $A_r&gt;0.67$. In contrast to the prolate $(A_r&lt;1)$ and spherical drops $(A_r=1)$, an oblate $(A_r&gt;1)$ drop with a high aspect ratio encapsulates air in a ring-like bubble within the pool and emerges a liquid column that undergoes Rayleigh-Plateau capillary instability, leading to the formation of two daughter droplets with complex shapes. When the parent drop is impacted with finite velocity, our observations indicate that increasing the Weber number leads to elevated crater heights on the free surface for all aspect ratios. A prolate drop produces a less pronounced wave swell and exhibits a prolonged impact duration owing to its negligible impact area. Conversely, an oblate drop generates a much wider wave swell than spherical and prolate drops. We analyze the relationship between rim formation dynamics and the kinetic and surface energies of the system. Finally, we establish an analogy by comparing the dynamics of a freely falling non-spherical drop, undergoing topological oscillations during its descent from a height, with the impact dynamics of parent drops of various shapes striking the liquid surface with an equivalent velocity. Our investigation involving non-spherical drops contrasts the extensive studies conducted by various researchers on the impact of a parent spherical drop just above the free surface of a liquid pool.</description>

      <title>Stress relaxation and thermo-visco-elastic effects in fluid-filled slits and fluid-loaded plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically analyse wave propagation in two canonical problems of interest: fluid-filled thermo-visco-elastic slits and fluid-loaded thermo-visco-elastic plates. We show that these two configurations can be studied via the same pair of dispersion equations with the aid of the framework developed in [https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2022.0193], which incoporates thermal effects. These two problems are further interrelated, since in the short wavelength limit (relative to the slit/plate width) the respective modes are governed by the same dispersion equation, commonly known as the Scholte--Stoneley equation. It is the Scholte-type modes that are mainly analyzed in this paper. We illustrate results when the fluid is water, although the theory is valid for any Newtonian fluid. Both `hard' and `soft' solids are compared, with the emphasis being placed on the importance of thermo-viscoelastic effects, particularly when stress relaxation is considered. Two main recent works are discussed extensively, namely [https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5078528] for slits and [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.063002] for loaded plates, both of which do not incorporate viscoelastic mechanisms. We show how the consideration of viscoelasticity can extend the results discussed therein, and explain the circumstances under which they arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents the development and results of an advanced SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) simulation framework, designed for high fidelity fluid dynamics modeling. Our framework, accessible at https://github.com/jason-huang03/SPH_Project, integrates various SPH algorithms including WCSPH, PCISPH, and DFSPH, alongside techniques for rigid-fluid coupling and high viscosity fluid simulations. Leveraging the computational power of CUDA and the versatility of Taichi, the framework excels in handling large-scale simulations with millions of particles. We demonstrate the capability of our framework through a series of simulations showcasing rigid-fluid coupling, high viscosity fluids, and large-scale fluid dynamics. Furthermore, a detailed performance analysis reveals CUDA's superior efficiency across different hardware platforms. This work is an exploraion into modern SPH simulation techniques, showcasing their practical implementation and capabilities.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on van der Waals and non-van der Waals liquid-impregnated surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a detailed experimental analysis using high-speed imagery to explore the impact dynamics of water droplets on liquid-infused surfaces (LIS). The LIS surfaces were created from textured substrates with varied post-spacings and were functionalized using octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS). Two types of liquid-infused surfaces were investigated: those coated with silicone oil (van der Waals) and those coated with Hexadecane (non-van der Waals). Droplet impacts were systematically investigated on these surfaces across a broad range of Weber numbers. Additionally, we assessed the stability of the LIS surface by calculating cloaking and spreading coefficients. The experimental outcomes revealed distinct droplet dynamics, including spreading, rebound, and unique phenomena related to oil interaction with surface textures. This study provides insights into the intricate dynamics of droplet interactions with LIS, offering valuable contributions to understanding surface-wetting phenomena.</description>

      <title>A continuous boostlet transform for acoustic waves in space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode the signal architecture have had an exceptional impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, the present study introduces a representation system for acoustic waves in 2D space-time, referred to as the boostlet transform, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields with the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Continuous boostlets, $\psi_{a,\theta,\tau}(\varsigma) = a^{-1} \psi \left(D_a^{-1} B_\theta^{-1}(\varsigma-\tau)\right) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations $a &gt; 0$, Lorentz boosts $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, and translations $\smash{\tau \in \mathbb{R}^2}$ in space--time. The admissibility condition requires that boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., have phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. The continuous boostlet transform is an isometry for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, and a sparsity analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that boostlet coefficients decay faster than wavelets, curvelets, wave atoms, and shearlets. The uncertainty principles and minimizers associated with the boostlet transform are derived and interpreted physically.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Tensor Basis Neural Networks for Reynolds stress modeling: application to plane channel and square duct flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) frameworks aimed at enhancing turbulence RANS modeling have recently been proposed in the literature as data-driven constitutive models for systems with known invariance properties. However, persistent ambiguities remain regarding the physical adequacy of applying the General Eddy Viscosity Model (GEVM). This work aims at investigating this aspect in an a priori stage for better predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, while preserving the Galilean and rotational invariances. In particular, we propose a general framework providing optimal tensor basis models for two types of canonical flows: Plane Channel Flow (PCF) and Square Duct Flow (SDF). Subsequently, deep neural networks based on these optimal models are trained using state-of-the-art strategies to achieve a balanced and physically sound prediction of the full anisotropy tensor. A priori results obtained by the proposed framework are in very good agreement with the reference DNS data. Notably, our shallow network with three layers provides accurate predictions of the anisotropy tensor for PCF at unobserved friction Reynolds numbers, both in interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Learning the SDF case is more challenging because of its physical nature and a lack of training data at various regimes. We propose to alleviate this problem based on Transfer Learning (TL). To more efficiently generalize to an unseen intermediate $\mathrm{Re}_\tau$ regime, we take advantage of our prior knowledge acquired from a training with a larger and wider dataset. Our results indicate the potential of the developed network model, and demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the TL process in terms of training data size and training time. Based on these results, we believe there is a promising future by integrating these neural networks into an adapted in-house RANS solver.</description>

      <title>A meshless and binless approach to compute statistics in 3D Ensemble PTV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to obtain superresolution of turbulent statistics for three-dimensional ensemble particle tracking velocimetry (EPTV). The method is ''meshless'' because it does not require the definition of a grid for computing derivatives, and it is ''binless'' because it does not require the definition of bins to compute local statistics. The method combines the constrained radial basis function (RBF) formalism introduced Sperotto et al. (Meas Sci Technol, 33:094005, 2022) with a kernel estimate approach for the ensemble averaging of the RBF regressions. The computational cost for the RBF regression is alleviated using the partition of unity method (PUM). Three test cases are considered: (1) a 1D illustrative problem on a Gaussian process, (2) a 3D synthetic test case reproducing a 3D jet-like flow, and (3) an experimental dataset collected for an underwater jet flow at $\text{Re} = 6750$ using a four-camera 3D PTV system. For each test case, the method performances are compared to traditional binning approaches such as Gaussian weighting (Ag\"u\'i and Jim\'enez, JFM, 185:447-468, 1987), local polynomial fitting (Ag\"uera et al, Meas Sci Technol, 27:124011, 2016), as well as a binned version of the RBF statistics.</description>

      <title>Electrolubrication in flowing liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the ``electrolubrication'' occurring in liquid mixtures confined between two charged surfaces. For a mixture of two liquids, the effective viscosity decreases markedly in the presence of a field. The origin of this reduction is field-induced phase separation, leading to the formation of two low-viscosity lubrication layers at the surfaces. These layers facilitate larger strain at a given stress. The effect is strong if the viscosities of the two liquids are sufficiently different, the volume fraction of the less viscous liquid is small, the gap between the surfaces is small, and the applied potential is large. The phase separation relies on the existence of dissociated ions in the solution. The effective viscosity is reduced by a factor $\alpha$; its maximum value is the ratio between the viscosities of the two liquids. In most liquids, $\alpha \sim1 $ -- $10$, and in mixtures of water and glycerol $\alpha \sim 80$ -- $100$ under relatively small potentials.</description>

      <title>Electrolubrication in liquid mixtures between two parallel plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe theoretically ``electrolubrication'' in liquid mixtures, the phenomenon where an electric field applied transverse to the confining surfaces leads to concentration gradients that alter the flow profile significantly. When the more polar liquid is the less viscous one, the stress in the liquid falls on two electric-field-induced thin lubrication layers. The thickness of the lubrication layer depends on the Debye length and the mixture correlation length. For the simple case of two parallel and infinite plates, we calculate explicitly the liquid velocity profile and integrated flux. The maximum liquid velocity and flux can be increased by a factor $\alpha$, of order $10$--$100$ or even more. For a binary mixture of water and a cosolvent, with viscosities $\eta_w$ and $\eta_{\rm cs}$, respectively, $\alpha$ increases monotonically with inter-plate potential $V$ and average ion content, and is large if the ratio $\eta_{\rm cs}/\eta_w$ is large.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of sessile aqueous droplets laden with surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With most of the focus to date having been on the coalescence of freely suspended droplets, much less is known about the coalescence of sessile droplets, especially in the case of droplets laden with surfactant. Here, we employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this phenomenon on substrates with different wettability. In particular, we unravel the mass transport mechanism of surfactant during coalescence, thus explaining the key mechanisms present in the process. Close similarities are found between the coalescence of sessile droplets with equilibrium contact angles above 90{\deg} and that of freely suspended droplets, being practically the same when the contact angle of the sessile droplets is above 140{\deg}. Here, the initial contact point is an area that creates an initial contact film of surfactant that proceeds to break into engulfed aggregates. A major change in the physics appears below the 90{\deg} contact angle, when the initial contact point becomes small and line-like, strongly affecting many aspects of the process and allowing water to take part in the coalescence from the beginning. We find growth exponents consistent with a 2/3 power law on strongly wettable substrates but no evidence of linear growth. Overall bridge growth speed increases with wettability for all surfactant concentrations, but the speeding up effect becomes weaker as surfactant concentration grows, along with a general slowdown of the coalescence compared to pure water. Concurrently, the duration of the initial thermally limited regime increases strongly by almost an order of magnitude for strongly wettable substrates.</description>

      <title>The role of fluid friction in streamer formation and biofilm growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacillus subtilis biofilms were grown in laminar channel flow at wall shear stress spanning one order of magnitude ($\tau_w = 0.068$ Pa to $\tau_w = 0.67$ Pa). We monitor, non-invasively, the evolution of the three-dimensional distribution of biofilm over seven days using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The obtained biofilms consist of many microcolonies where the characteristic colony has a base structure in the form of a leaning pillar and a streamer in the form of a thin filament that originates near the tip of the pillar. While the shape, size and distribution of these microcolonies depend on the imposed shear stress, the same structural features appear consistently for all shear stress values. The formation of streamers seems to occur after the development of a base structure, suggesting that the latter induces a curved secondary flow that triggers the formation of the streamers. Moreover, we observe that the biofilm volume grows approximately linearly over seven days for all the shear stress values, with a growth rate that is inversely proportional to the wall shear stress. We develop a simple model of friction-limited growth, which agrees with the experimental observations. The model provides physical insight into growth mechanisms and can be used to develop accurate continuum models of bacterial biofilm growth.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of Stochastic Rotating Shallow Water Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, the authors have developed a generic methodology for calibrating the noise in fluid dynamics stochastic partial differential equations where the stochasticity was introduced to parametrize subgrid-scale processes. The stochastic parameterization of sub-grid scale processes is required in the estimation of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions, to represent systematic model errors arising from subgrid-scale fluctuations. The previous methodology used a principal component analysis (PCA) technique based on the ansatz that the increments of the stochastic parametrization are normally distributed.
  In this paper, the PCA technique is replaced by a generative model technique. This enables us to avoid imposing additional constraints on the increments. The methodology is tested on a stochastic rotating shallow water model with the elevation variable of the model used as input data. The numerical simulations show that the noise is indeed non-Gaussian. The generative modelling technology gives good RMSE, CRPS score and forecast rank histogram results.</description>

      <title>Computational Study on the Impact of Gasoline-Ethanol Blending on Autoignition and Soot/NOx Emissions under Gasoline Compression Ignition Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a single-cylinder gasoline compression ignition engine are performed to investigate the impact of gasoline-ethanol blending on autoignition, nitrogen oxide (NOx), and soot emissions under low-load conditions. A four-component toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) + ethanol (ETPRF) surrogate (with 10% ethanol by volume; E10) is employed to represent the test gasoline (RD5-87). A 3D engine CFD model employing finite-rate chemistry with a skeletal kinetic mechanism, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and hybrid method of moments (HMOM) is adopted to capture in-cylinder combustion and soot/NOx emissions. The engine CFD model is validated against experimental data for three gasoline-ethanol blends: E10, E30 and E100, with varying ethanol content by volume. Model validation is carried out for multiple start-of-injection (SOI) timings (-21, -27, -36, and -45 crank angle degrees after top-dead-center (aTDC)) with respect to in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, NOx and soot emissions. For late injection timings (-21 and -27oaTDC), E30 yields higher soot than E10; while the trend reverses for early injection cases (-36 and -45oaTDC). E100 yields the lowest amount of soot among all fuels irrespective of SOI timing. Further, E10 shows a non-monotonic trend in soot emissions with SOI timing: SOI-36&gt;SOI-45&gt;SOI-21&gt;SOI-27, while soot emissions from E30 exhibit monotonic decrease with advancing SOI timing. NOx emissions from various fuels follow a trend of E10&gt;E30&gt;E100. NOx emissions increase as SOI timing is advanced for all fuels, with an anomaly for E10 and E100 where NOx decreases when SOI is advanced beyond -36oaTDC. Detailed analysis of the numerical results is performed to investigate the emission trends and elucidate the impact of chemical composition and physical properties on autoignition and emissions characteristics.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability due to massive vortex cores, friction and confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamical instability responsible for the breakdown of regular rows and necklaces of quantized vortices that appear at the interface between two superfluids in relative motion. Making use of a generalized point-vortex model, we identify several mechanisms leading to the suppression of this instability. They include a non-zero mass of the vortex cores, dissipative processes resulting from the interaction between the vortices and the excitations of the superfluid, and the proximity of the vortex array to the sample boundaries. We show that massive vortex cores not only have a mitigating effect on the dynamical instability, but also change the associated scaling law and affect the direction along which it develops. The predictions of our massive and dissipative point-vortex model are eventually compared against recent experimental measurements of the maximum instability growth rate relevant to vortex necklaces in a cold-atom platform.</description>

      <title>A Vortex Damping Outflow Forcing for Multiphase Flows with Sharp Interfacial Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflow boundaries play an important role in multiphase fluid dynamics simulations that involve transition between liquid and vapor phases. These flows are dominated by low Weber numbers and a sharp jump in pressure, velocity, and temperature. Inadequate treatment of these jumps at the outlet generates undesirable fluid disturbances that propagate upstream and lead to instabilities within the computational domain. To mitigate these disturbances, we introduce a forcing term that can be applied to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to enforce stability in the numerical solution. The forcing term acts as a damping mechanism to control vortices that are generated by droplet/bubbles in multiphase flows, and is designed to be a general formulation that can be coupled with a fixed pressure outflow boundary condition to simulate a variety of multiphase flow problems. We demonstrate its applicability to simulate pool and flow boiling problems, where bubble-induced vortices during evaporation and condensation present a challenge at the outflow. Validation and verification cases are chosen to quantify accuracy and stability of the proposed method in comparison to established benchmarks and reference solutions, along with detailed performance analysis for three-dimensional simulations on leadership supercomputing platforms. Computational experiments are performed using Flash-X, which is a composable open-source software instrument designed for multiscale fluid dynamics simulations on heterogeneous architectures.</description>

      <title>Experimental assessment of square wave spatial spanwise forcing of a turbulent boundary layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental realisation of spatial spanwise forcing in a turbulent boundary layer flow, aimed at reducing the frictional drag. The forcing is achieved by a series of spanwise running belts, running in alternating spanwise direction, thereby generating a steady spatial square-wave forcing. SPIV in the streamwise-wall-normal plane is used to investigate the impact of actuation on the flow in terms of turbulence statistics, drag performance characteristics, and spanwise velocity profiles, for a non-dimensional wavelength of $\lambda_x^+ = 397$. We confirm that a significant flow control effect can be realised with this type of forcing. The scalar fields of the higher-order turbulence statistics show a strong attenuation of stresses and production of turbulence kinetic energy over the first belt already, followed by a more gradual decrease to a steady-state energy response over the second belt. The streamwise velocity in the near-wall region is reduced, indicative of a drag-reduced flow state. The profiles of the higher-order turbulence statistics are attenuated up to a wall-normal height of $y^+ \approx 100$, with a maximum streamwise stress reduction of 45% and a reduction of integral turbulence kinetic energy production of 39%, for a non-dimensional actuation amplitude of $A^+ = 12.7$. An extension of the classical laminar Stokes layer theory is introduced, to describe the non-sinusoidal boundary condition that corresponds to the current case. The spanwise velocity profiles show good agreement with this extended theoretical model. The drag reduction was estimated from a linear fit in the viscous sublayer in the range $2 \leq y^+\leq 5$. The results are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the numerical implementations of Viotti et al. (2009), matching the drag reduction trend with $A^+$, and reaching a maximum of 20%.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Graph Network(FVGN): Predicting unsteady incompressible fluid dynamics with finite volume informed neural network</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has significant implications for the advancement of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Currently, most pixel-grid-based deep learning methods for flow field prediction exhibit significantly reduced accuracy in predicting boundary layer flows and poor adaptability to geometric shapes. Although Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for unstructured grids based unsteady flow prediction have better geometric adaptability, these models suffer from error accumulation in long-term predictions of unsteady flows. More importantly, fully data-driven models often require extensive training time, greatly limiting the rapid update and iteration speed of deep learning models when facing more complex unsteady flows. Therefore, this paper aims to balance the demands for training overhead and prediction accuracy by integrating physical constraints based on the finite volume method into the loss function of the graph neural network. Additionally, it incorporates a twice-massage aggregation mechanism inspired by the extended stencil method to enhance the unsteady flow prediction accuracy and geometric shape generalization ability of the graph neural network model on unstructured grids. We focus particularly on the model's predictive accuracy within the boundary layer. Compared to fully data-driven methods, our model achieves better predictive accuracy and geometric shape generalization ability in a shorter training time.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of reduced order source terms for a coupled wave-circulation model in the Gulf of Mexico</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During hurricanes, coupled wave-circulation models are critical tools for public safety. The standard approach is to use a high fidelity circulation model coupled with a wave model which uses the most advanced source terms. As a result, the models can be highly computationally expensive and so this study investigates the potential consequences of using highly simplified (reduced order) source terms within the wave model component of the coupled wave-circulation model. The trade-off between run time and accuracy with respect to observations is quantified for a set of two storms that impacted the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Ida. Water surface elevations as well as wave statistics (significant wave height, peak period, and mean wave direction) are compared to observations. The usage of the reduced order source terms yielded significant savings in computational cost. Additionally, relatively low amounts of additional error with respect to observations during the simulations with reduced order source terms. However, large changes in global model outputs of the wave statistics were observed based on the choice of source terms particularly near the track of each hurricane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experiments on oscillating hydrofoils undergoing combined heaving and pitching motions, paying particular attention to connections between propulsive efficiency and coherent wake features extracted using modal analysis. Time-averaged forces and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow field downstream of the foil are presented for a Reynolds number of Re=11$\times$10$^3$ and Strouhal numbers in the range St=0.16-0.35. These conditions produce 2S and 2P wake patterns, as well as a near-momentumless wake structure. A triple decomposition using the optimized dynamic mode decomposition (opt-DMD) method is employed to identify dominant modal components (or coherent structures) in the wake. These structures can be connected to wake instabilities predicted using spatial stability analyses. Examining the modal components of the wake provides insightful explanations into the transition from drag to thrust production, and conditions that lead to peak propulsive efficiency. In particular, we find modes that correspond to the primary vortex development in the wakes. Other modal components capture elements of bluff body shedding at Strouhal numbers below the optimum for peak propulsive efficiency and characteristics of separation for Strouhal numbers higher than the optimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of complex dynamics in fluid flows demands a substantial number of degrees of freedom, i.e. a high-dimensional state space. Nevertheless, the swift attenuation of small-scale perturbations due to viscous diffusion permits in principle the representation of these flows using a significantly reduced dimensionality. Over time, the dynamics of such flows evolve towards a finite-dimensional invariant manifold. Using only data from direct numerical simulations, in the present work we identify the manifold and determine evolution equations for the dynamics on it. We use an advanced autoencoder framework to automatically estimate the intrinsic dimension of the manifold and provide an orthogonal coordinate system. Then, we learn the dynamics by determining an equation on the manifold by using both a function space approach (approximating the Koopman operator) and a state space approach (approximating the vector field on the manifold). We apply this method to exact coherent states for Kolmogorov flow and minimal flow unit pipe flow. Fully resolved simulations for these cases require O(103) and O(105) degrees of freedom respectively, and we build models with two or three degrees of freedom that faithfully capture the dynamics of these flows. For these examples, both the state space and function space time evaluations provide highly accurate predictions of the long-time dynamics in manifold coordinates.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Models for Airfoil Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantage of providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence on tonal noise generation and its control in tip-leakage flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study is first to provide experimental evidence of tonal noise and acoustic feedback by a stationary airfoil with a tip-gap placed between two side plates. Tones are linked to an aero-acoustic coupling using synchronized measurements between Particle Image Velocimetry and far-field microphone probes. To aid in the correlation analysis, the wall boundary condition on the pressure side of the airfoil was modified by introducing surface roughness. For tip leakage flows without roughness elements, the far-field acoustic spectra show peaks in the acoustic autospectra. These peaks are present regardless of the flow speed studied. The findings reveal that tones associated with tip-gap extend till 16.5 kHz in a low-noise facility. Roughness alters cross-flow velocity along the airfoil chord, influencing acoustics at matched Reynolds and Mach numbers. Roughness induces cancellation of spectral peaks and changes in the velocity and acoustic pressure correlation pattern between airfoil pressure and suction side. Modal shapes confirm the presence of coherent structures in the tip-gap region, with smooth surfaces exhibiting confined flow instabilities and non-dipolar noise sources around and beyond 10 kHz. At these high frequencies, the sound radiation mechanism can be uniquely attributed to neither a jet-like noise source nor these acoustic peaks can be uniquely attributed to coherent structures in the tip-gap region. On the contrary, coherence between airfoil sides is required for noise peaks, which stresses the importance of diffraction on the airfoil pressure side and acoustic feedback.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous ocean-exploring vehicles have begun to take advantage of onboard sensor measurements of water properties such as salinity and temperature to locate oceanic features in real time. Such targeted sampling strategies enable more rapid study of ocean environments by actively steering towards areas of high scientific value. Inspired by the ability of aquatic animals to navigate via flow sensing, this work investigates hydrodynamic cues for accomplishing targeted sampling using a palm-sized robotic swimmer. As proof-of-concept analogy for tracking hydrothermal vent plumes in the ocean, the robot is tasked with locating the center of turbulent jet flows in a 13,000-liter water tank using data from onboard pressure sensors. To learn a navigation strategy, we first implemented Reinforcement Learning (RL) on a simulated version of the robot navigating in proximity to turbulent jets. After training, the RL algorithm discovered an effective strategy for locating the jets by following transverse velocity gradients sensed by pressure sensors located on opposite sides of the robot. When implemented on the physical robot, this gradient following strategy enabled the robot to successfully locate the turbulent plumes at more than twice the rate of random searching. Additionally, we found that navigation performance improved as the distance between the pressure sensors increased, which can inform the design of distributed flow sensors in ocean robots. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and limits of flow-based navigation for autonomously locating hydrodynamic features of interest.</description>

Abstract: We consider turbulence of waves that interact weakly via four-wave scattering (sea waves, plasma waves, spin waves, and many others). In the first non-vanishing order in the interaction, the occupation number of waves satisfy a closed kinetic equation which has stationary solutions describing turbulent cascades. We show that a straightforward perturbation theory beyond the kinetic equation gives terms that generally diverge both at small (IR) and large (UV) wavenumbers for a direct cascade. The analysis up to the third order identifies the most UV-divergent terms. In order to gain qualitative analytic control, we sum a subset of the most UV divergent term, to all orders, giving a perturbation theory which is generally free from UV divergence, showing that turbulence becomes independent of the dissipation scale when it goes to zero. On the contrary, the ever-present IR divergence means that the effective coupling is parametrically larger than the naive estimate and grows with the pumping scale (similar to anomalous scaling in fluid turbulence). This suggests that the kinetic equation does not describe wave turbulence even of arbitrarily small level if the cascade is sufficiently long. We show that the character of strong turbulence is determined by the sign of the coupling, that is, whether the effective four-wave interaction is enhanced or suppressed by collective effects. The enhancement possibly signals that strong turbulence is dominated by multi-wave bound states (solitons, shocks, cusps), similar to confinement in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of isotropy in rotating turbulence of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03968</link>

Abstract: We present a study on the development of rotating turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates with a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii model. Turbulence is generated by driving the lattice of quantized vortices in a harmonic potential with a random forcing potential. As the turbulence progressed, the initial alignment of vortices underwent slight disruptions, thereby increasing the high-wavenumber components of the kinetic energy. In the turbulent state, the distribution of incompressible kinetic energy exhibits milder anisotropy than that in the initial lattice state and demonstrates a scaling behavior of $k_z^{-2.5}$ in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. In contrast, the compressible kinetic energy exhibits an isotropic scaling behavior at high wavenumbers.</description>
