      <title>RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction Based on Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between Ribonucleic Acids (RNAs) and proteins, also called RNA Protein Interaction (RPI), plays an important role in the life activities of organisms, including in various regulatory processes, such as gene splicing, gene localization, and disease pathogenesis. RPI Prediction (RPIP) predicts the interactions between RNAs and proteins, which includes looking for the existence of interactions and the binding sites of interactions, and adding RNA-protein functional annotations (such as immunity regulation, neuroprotection, etc). Due to the huge amounts of complex biological data, Deep Learning-based RPIP (DL-based RPIP) has been widely investigated, as it can extract high-dimensional features from data and make accurate predictions. Over the last decade, there have been many achievements and contributions in DL-based RPIP. Although some previous studies review DL-based RPIP, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of a comprehensive survey. In this paper, we extensively survey DL-based RPIP in terms of its entire process, including: feature encoding, deep learning modeling, results evaluation, RPIP application domains, and available websites and software. We also identify some open research challenges, and discuss the potential future work for DL-based RPIP.</description>

      <title>smICA: an open source repository for mapping the concentration of fluorescenctly labeled molecules in living cells on the basis of confocal imaging combined with time-correlated single-photon counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced microscopy techniques are essential for visualizing and tracking cellular components and molecules in biomedical research. However, conventional fluorescence microscopy methods often struggle with accurately measuring molecule concentrations in cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates laser scanning confocal microscopy with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), supported by an open-source analysis tool called smICA (single-molecule Image to Concentration Analyzer). Our method, validated against traditional fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), offers enhanced accuracy in determining fluorescent molecule concentrations, particularly in cases where molecules are immobile or unevenly distributed. This is demonstrated using fluorescently labeled mRNA in living cells, highlighting the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Binding Affinity Prediction: From Conventional to Machine Learning-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding is the process by which a small molecule (drug or inhibitor) attaches to a target protein. The binding affinity, which refers to the strength of this interaction, is central to many important problems in bioinformatics such as drug design. An extensive amount of work has been devoted to predicting binding affinity over the past decades due to its significance. In this paper, we review all significant recent works, focusing on the methods, features, and benchmark datasets. We have observed a rising trend in the use of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for predicting binding affinity, accompanied by an increasing amount of data on proteins and small drug-like molecules. While prediction results are constantly improving, we also identify several open questions and potential directions that remain unexplored in the field. This paper could serve as an excellent starting point for machine learning researchers who wish to engage in the study of binding affinity, or for anyone with general interests in machine learning, drug discovery, and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Alignment of Histopathological Images Using Cell Segmentation and Point Set Matching for Integrative Cancer Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathological imaging is vital for cancer research and clinical practice, with multiplexed Immunofluorescence (MxIF) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) providing complementary insights. However, aligning different stains at the cell level remains a challenge due to modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel framework for multimodal image alignment using cell segmentation outcomes. By treating cells as point sets, we apply Coherent Point Drift (CPD) for initial alignment and refine it with Graph Matching (GM). Evaluated on ovarian cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs), our method achieves high alignment accuracy, enabling integration of cell-level features across modalities and generating virtual H&amp;E images from MxIF data for enhanced clinical interpretation.</description>

      <title>EnzymeFlow: Generating Reaction-specific Enzyme Catalytic Pockets through Flow Matching and Co-Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzyme design is a critical area in biotechnology, with applications ranging from drug development to synthetic biology. Traditional methods for enzyme function prediction or protein binding pocket design often fall short in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly in catalytic processes. To address the challenges, we introduce EnzymeFlow, a generative model that employs flow matching with hierarchical pre-training and enzyme-reaction co-evolution to generate catalytic pockets for specific substrates and catalytic reactions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale, curated, and validated dataset of enzyme-reaction pairs, specifically designed for the catalytic pocket generation task, comprising a total of $328,192$ pairs. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics and reaction-specific adaptations, EnzymeFlow becomes a powerful model for designing enzyme pockets, which is capable of catalyzing a wide range of biochemical reactions. Experiments on the new dataset demonstrate the model's effectiveness in designing high-quality, functional enzyme catalytic pockets, paving the way for advancements in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology. We provide EnzymeFlow code at https://github.com/WillHua127/EnzymeFlow with notebook demonstration at https://github.com/WillHua127/EnzymeFlow/blob/main/enzymeflow_demo.ipynb.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Decisions in Precision Medicine: Disentangling Treatment Assignment Bias in Counterfactual Outcome Prediction and Biomarker Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision medicine offers the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual patients, yet it faces significant challenges due to the complex biases in clinical observational data and the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact on machine learning (ML) models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>BioFace3D: A fully automatic pipeline for facial biomarkers extraction of 3D face reconstructions segmented from MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial dysmorphologies have emerged as potential critical indicators in the diagnosis and prognosis of genetic, psychotic and rare disorders. While in certain conditions these dysmorphologies are severe, in other cases may be subtle and not perceivable to the human eye, requiring precise quantitative tools for their identification. Manual coding of facial dysmorphologies is a burdensome task and is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. To overcome this gap, we present BioFace3D as a fully automatic tool for the calculation of facial biomarkers using facial models reconstructed from magnetic resonance images. The tool is divided into three automatic modules for the extraction of 3D facial models from magnetic resonance images, the registration of homologous 3D landmarks encoding facial morphology, and the calculation of facial biomarkers from anatomical landmarks coordinates using geometric morphometrics techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Dynamics from Snapshots through Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learnt directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape.</description>

      <title>Generative models of MRI-derived neuroimaging features and associated dataset of 18,000 samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Availability of large and diverse medical datasets is often challenged by privacy and data sharing restrictions. For successful application of machine learning techniques for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine, large amounts of data are necessary for model building and optimization. To help overcome such limitations in the context of brain MRI, we present GenMIND: a collection of generative models of normative regional volumetric features derived from structural brain imaging. GenMIND models are trained on real brain imaging regional volumetric measures from the iSTAGING consortium, which encompasses over 40,000 MRI scans across 13 studies, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, and race. Leveraging GenMIND, we produce and offer 18,000 synthetic samples spanning the adult lifespan (ages 22-90 years), alongside the model's capability to generate unlimited data. Experimental results indicate that samples generated from GenMIND agree with the distributions obtained from real data. Most importantly, the generated normative data significantly enhance the accuracy of downstream machine learning models on tasks such as disease classification. Data and models are available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rongguangw/GenMIND.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the broadly applicable context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for applicability to unknown structures); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for unknown pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that (1) DL methods consistently outperform conventional docking algorithms; (2) most recent DL docking methods fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets; and (3) training DL methods with physics-informed loss functions on diverse clusters of protein-ligand complexes is a promising direction for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>

      <title>CompassDock: Comprehensive Accurate Assessment Approach for Deep Learning-Based Molecular Docking in Inference and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datasets used for molecular docking, such as PDBBind, contain technical variability - they are noisy. Although the origins of the noise have been discussed, a comprehensive analysis of the physical, chemical, and bioactivity characteristics of the datasets is still lacking. To address this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive Accurate Assessment (Compass). Compass integrates two key components: PoseCheck, which examines ligand strain energy, protein-ligand steric clashes, and interactions, and AA-Score, a new empirical scoring function for calculating binding affinity energy. Together, these form a unified workflow that assesses both the physical/chemical properties and bioactivity favorability of ligands and protein-ligand interactions. Our analysis of the PDBBind dataset using Compass reveals substantial noise in the ground truth data. Additionally, we propose CompassDock, which incorporates the Compass module with DiffDock, the state-of-the-art deep learning-based molecular docking method, to enable accurate assessment of docked ligands during inference. Finally, we present a new paradigm for enhancing molecular docking model performance by fine-tuning with Compass Scores, which encompass binding affinity energy, strain energy, and the number of steric clashes identified by Compass. Our results show that, while fine-tuning without Compass improves the percentage of docked poses with RMSD &lt; 2{\AA}, it leads to a decrease in physical/chemical and bioactivity favorability. In contrast, fine-tuning with Compass shows a limited improvement in RMSD &lt; 2{\AA} but enhances the physical/chemical and bioactivity favorability of the ligand conformation. The source code is available publicly at https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/CompassDock.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation (https://github.com/WillHua127/ReactZyme).</description>
