      <title>SARIS: Accelerating Stencil Computations on Energy-Efficient RISC-V Compute Clusters with Indirect Stream Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stencil codes are performance-critical in many compute-intensive applications, but suffer from significant address calculation and irregular memory access overheads. This work presents SARIS, a general and highly flexible methodology for stencil acceleration using register-mapped indirect streams. We demonstrate SARIS for various stencil codes on an eight-core RISC-V compute cluster with indirect stream registers, achieving significant speedups of 2.72x, near-ideal FPU utilizations of 81%, and energy efficiency improvements of 1.58x over an RV32G baseline on average. Scaling out to a 256-core manycore system, we estimate an average FPU utilization of 64%, an average speedup of 2.14x, and up to 15% higher fractions of peak compute than a leading GPU code generator.</description>

      <title>Predefined Software Environment Runtimes As A Measure For Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI), we have developed a way to preserve a software package into an easy to deploy and use sandbox environment we call a "runtime", via a program we developed called MaPS : MaRDI Packaging System. The program relies on Linux user namespaces to isolate a library environment from the host system, making the sandboxed software reproducible on other systems, with minimal effort. Moreover an overlay filesystem makes local edits persistent. This project will aid reproducibility efforts of research papers: both mathematical and from other disciplines. As a proof of concept, we provide runtimes for the OSCAR Computer Algebra System, polymake software for research in polyhedral geometry, and VIBRANT Virus Identification By iteRative ANnoTation. The software is in a prerelease state: the interface for creating, deploying, and executing runtimes is final, and an interface for easily publishing runtimes is under active development. We thus propose publishing predefined, distributable software environment runtimes along with research papers in an effort to make research with software based results reproducible.</description>

      <title>Interactive Formal Specification for Mathematical Problems of Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the second part of a precise description of the prototype  that has been developed in the course of the ISAC project over the last  two decades. This part describes the "specify-phase", while the first part describing the "solve-phase" is already published.
  In the specify-phase a student interactively constructs a formal specification. The ISAC prototype implements formal specifications as established in theoretical computer science, however, the input language for the construction  avoids requiring users to have knowledge of logic; this makes the system useful for various engineering faculties (and also for high school).
  The paper discusses not only ISAC's design of the specify-phase in detail, but also gives a brief introduction to implementation with the aim of advertising the re-use of formal frameworks (inclusive respective front-ends) with their generic tools for language definition and their rich pool of software  components for formal mathematics.

      <title>Ricci-Notation Tensor Framework for Model-based Approaches to Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based approaches to imaging, like specialized image enhancements in astronomy, facilitate explanations of relationships between observed inputs and computed outputs. These models may be expressed with extended matrix-vector (EMV) algebra, especially when they involve only scalars, vectors, and matrices, and with n-mode or index notations, when they involve multidimensional arrays, also called numeric tensors or, simply, tensors. While this paper features an example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that employs tensors to reveal (inverse) 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising a dual-variant index notation, with Einstein summation convention, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency via careful design of numeric tensor and dual-variant index classes. Compared to its closest competitor, also a numeric tensor framework that uses index notation, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.</description>
