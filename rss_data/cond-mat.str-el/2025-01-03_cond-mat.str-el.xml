      <title>Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Pairing correlation of the Kagome-lattice Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently discovered family of Kagome lattice materials, $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$($\emph{A}$= $\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs}$), has attracted great interest, especially in the debate over its dominant superconducting pairing symmetry. To explore this issue, we study the superconducting pairing behavior within the Kagome-Hubbard model through the constrained path Monte Carlo method. It is found that doping around the Dirac point generates a dominant next-nearest-neighbour-$d$ pairing symmetry driven by on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. However, when considering the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, it may induce nearest-neighbor-$p$ pairing to become the preferred pairing symmetry. Our results provide useful information to identify the dominant superconducting pairing symmetry in $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$ family.</description>

      <title>Topic Review: Hatsugai-Kohmoto models: Exactly solvable playground for Mottness and Non-Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This pedagogic review aims to give a gentle introduction to an exactly solvable model, the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model, which has infinite-ranged interaction but conserves the center of mass. Although this model is invented in 1992, intensive studies on its properties ranging from unconventional superconductivity, topological ordered states to non-Fermi liquid behaviors are made since 2020. We focus on its emergent non-Fermi liquid behavior and provide discussion on its thermodynamics, single-particle and two-particle correlation functions. Perturbation around solvable limit has also been explored with the help of perturbation theory, renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculation. We hope the present review will be helpful for graduate students or researchers interested in HK-like models or more generic strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States for fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) was recently proposed to leverage the advantages of both Clifford circuits and Matrix Product States (MPS). Clifford circuits can support large entanglement and can be efficiently simulated classically according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. So in CAMPS, MPS needs only to handle the so-called Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy which significantly improves the simulation accuracy for a given bond dimension. In this work, we generalize CAMPS to study the Fermion system by taking advantage of the Jordan-Wigner transformation which can map the studied Fermion system to a spin system. We benchmark the method on both the spinless $t-V$ model and the spinful Hubbard model. Our test results show significant improvement of the accuracy of CAMPS over MPS, especially when the interactions are strong. Fermionic CAMPS provides a useful tool for the accurate study of many-body fermion systems in the future and has the potential to help resolve long-standing issues.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Quantum 2.0: Challenges in understanding Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost a century on from the culmination of the first revolution in quantum physics, we are poised for another. Even as we engage in the creation of impactful quantum technologies, it is imperative for us to face the challenges in understanding the phenomenology of various emergent forms of quantum matter. This will involve building on decades of progress in quantum condensed matter physics, and going beyond the well-established Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm for quantum matter. We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress. These efforts will enable the prediction of new quantum materials whose properties facilitate the creation of next generation technologies.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous evolution of a dense ensemble of optically pumped excitons to the excitonic insulator state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Parallelism for Fast Feynman Diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagrammatic expansions are a paradigmatic and powerful tool of quantum many-body theory. Their evaluation to high order, e.g., by the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, can provide unbiased results in strongly correlated and challenging regimes. However, calculating a factorial number of terms to acceptable precision remains very costly even for state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a dramatic acceleration of evaluating Feynman's diagrammatic series by use of specialised hardware architecture within the recently introduced combinatorial summation (CoS) framework. We present how exploiting the massive parallelism and concurrency available from GPUs leads to orders of magnitude improvement in computation time even on consumer-grade hardware. This provides a platform for making probes of novel phenomena of strong correlations much more accessible.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Spin and Point-Group Adaptation in Exact Diagonalization of Spin Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While either spin or point-group adaptation is straightforward when considered independently, the standard technique for factoring isotropic spin Hamiltonians by the total spin S and the irreducible representation of the point-group is limited by the complexity of transformations between different coupling-schemes that are related by site-permutations. To overcome these challenges, we apply projection-operators directly to uncoupled basis-states, enabling the simultaneous treatment of spin and point-group symmetry without the need for recoupling-transformations. This provides a simple and efficient approach for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin-models that we illustrate with applications to Heisenberg spin-rings and polyhedra, including systems that are computationally inaccessible with conventional coupling-techniques.</description>

      <title>A Magnon Band Analysis of GdRu2Si2 in the Field-Polarized State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials is a problem of fundamental and technological interest. GdRu2Si2 is one such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to \textit{ab initio} calculations are made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation of multi-Q ground states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic frustration and weak Mn magnetic ordering in EuMn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity, magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ single crystals. Antiferromagnetic order of Eu was observed in several quantities at $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K$. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of $\approx 47\,\rm K$ has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an Eu$^{2+}$ resonance, which probes the weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the $47\,\rm K$ scale and by the ESR intensity which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and below $47\,\rm K$. In the same temperature range anomalies were observed at $48.5\,\rm K$ and $51\,\rm K$ in the heat capacity data as well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ samples. In XMCD and XMLD measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same temperature range which might be due to the small magnetic moment, with a potential $c$-component or frustration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and Real-time Dynamic Properties of Complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16270v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior of a relativistic field theory in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tricritical behavior in a class of one-dimensional (1D) field theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature and chemical potential is analyzed. In the Gross-Neveu (GN)-type models of massless fermions the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. After doping, the symmetry is restored at a critical chemical potential. We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength. We also discuss about the consequences of the consideration of inhomogeneous condensates to the tricritical point, within the Ginzburg-Landau expansion.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Commensurate and Incommensurate Antiferromagnetic Groundstates in Co$_x$NbSe$_2$ Single Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Co$_x$NbSe$_2$, crystal symmetry, and cobalt site occupation drive the formation of two distinct magnetic phases. At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)</description>

      <title>Unconventional Coherence Peak in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I&gt;1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kagome Metal GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$: A 4d Playground for Topological Magnetism and Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have garnered considerable attention as an ideal platform for investigating intrinsic topological structures, frustrated magnetism, and electron correlation effects. In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) {\AA} and c = 9.536(8) {\AA}. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences. Our findings pave the way for exploring RNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare earth) with customized substitutions of R sites to fine-tune their properties.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of broken-symmetry approach to exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119{\deg}, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Constructive impact of Wannier-Stark field on environment-boosted quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's initial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for charging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of the battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more affected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a critical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery. Further, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the battery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only hopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS field irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it is possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging when the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high temperatures -- this process we refer to as {\it environment-assisted ergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such an environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is increased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite interaction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger, energy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in the presence of the thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dirac Quantum Spin Liquid in YbZn2GaO5</title>

Abstract: The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.</description>

      <title>Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02547v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T&gt;0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By virtue of being atomically thin, the electronic properties of heterostructures built from two-dimensional materials are strongly influenced by atomic relaxation. The atomic layers behave as flexible membranes rather than rigid crystals. Here we develop an analytical theory of lattice relaxation in twisted moir\'e materials. We obtain analytical results for the lattice displacements and corresponding pseudo gauge fields, as a function of twist angle. We benchmark our results for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our \textit{single-parameter} theory is valid in graphene bilayers for twist angles $\theta ~\gtrsim 0.7^\circ$, and in twisted WSe$_2$ for $\theta ~\gtrsim 1.6^\circ$. We also investigate how relaxation alters the electronic structure in twisted bilayer graphene, providing a simple extension to the continuum model to account for lattice relaxation.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena. Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration, and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully gapped and time-reversal symmetric quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies, accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and the bulk. The advent of moir\'e materials and a variety of quantum simulators provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to life in a controlled fashion.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of a Disorder Driven Electronic Smectic Phase in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetal GdSbTe</title>

Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the N\'{e}el transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating Lattice Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Representing arbitrary ground states of toric code by a restricted Boltzmann machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the single-particle sector exhibits chaotic dynamics. We study the corresponding many-body spectral statistics and show that the spectral form factor (SFF) can be computed \textit{exactly}. Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>
