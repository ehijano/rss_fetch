      <title>Quantifying Global Networks of Exchange through the Louvain Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports provide detailed analyses of major policy issues to members of the US Congress. We extract and analyze data from 2,010 CRS reports written between 1996 and 2024 in order to quantify the relationships between countries. The data is processed and converted into a weighted graph, representing 172 unique countries as nodes and 4,137 interests as bidirectional edges. Through the Louvain method, we use a greedy algorithm to extract non-overlapping communities from our network and identify clusters with shared interests. We then compute the eigenvector centrality of countries, effectively highlighting their network influence. The results of this work could enable improvements in sourcing evidence for analytic products and understanding the connectivity of our world.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Embedding through Hub-aware Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of high-degree nodes, or hubs, in shaping graph dynamics and structure is well-recognized in network science, yet their influence remains underexplored in the context of dynamic graph embedding. Recent advances in representation learning for graphs have shown that random walk-based methods can capture both structural and temporal patterns, but often overlook the impact of hubs on walk trajectories and embedding stability. In this paper, we introduce DeepHub, a method for dynamic graph embedding that explicitly integrates hub sensitivity into random walk sampling strategies. Focusing on dynnode2vec as a representative dynamic embedding method, we systematically analyze the effect of hub-biased walks across nine real-world temporal networks. Our findings reveal that standard random walks tend to overrepresent hub nodes, leading to embeddings that underfit the evolving local context of less-connected nodes. By contrast, hub-aware walks can balance exploration, resulting in embeddings that better preserve temporal neighborhood structure and improve downstream task performance. These results suggest that hub-awareness is an important yet overlooked factor in dynamic graph embedding, and our work provides a foundation for more robust, structure-sensitive representation learning in evolving networks.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics of Harmful Content Dissemination on WhatsApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WhatsApp, a platform with more than two billion global users, plays a crucial role in digital communication, but also serves as a vector for harmful content such as misinformation, hate speech, and political propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of harmful message dissemination in WhatsApp groups, with a focus on their structural characteristics. Using a comprehensive data set of more than 5.1 million messages, including text, images, and videos, collected from approximately 6,000 groups in India, we reconstruct message propagation cascades to analyze dissemination patterns.
  Our findings reveal that harmful messages consistently achieve greater depth and breadth of dissemination compared to messages without harmful annotations, with videos and images emerging as the primary modes of dissemination. These results suggest a distinctive pattern of dissemination of harmful content. However, our analysis indicates that modality alone cannot fully account for the structural differences in propagation.
  The findings highlight the critical role of structural characteristics in the spread of these harmful messages, suggesting that strategies targeting structural characteristics of re-sharing could be crucial in managing the dissemination of such content on private messaging platforms.</description>

      <title>Signals from the Floods: AI-Driven Disaster Analysis through Multi-Source Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive and diverse web data are increasingly vital for government disaster response, as demonstrated by the 2022 floods in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This study examines how X (formerly Twitter) and public inquiry submissions provide insights into public behaviour during crises. We analyse more than 55,000 flood-related tweets and 1,450 submissions to identify behavioural patterns during extreme weather events. While social media posts are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and inform long-term resilience planning.</description>

      <title>Predictively Combatting Toxicity in Health-related Online Discussions through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In health-related topics, user toxicity in online discussions frequently becomes a source of social conflict or promotion of dangerous, unscientific behaviour; common approaches for battling it include different forms of detection, flagging and/or removal of existing toxic comments, which is often counterproductive for platforms and users alike. In this work, we propose the alternative of combatting user toxicity predictively, anticipating where a user could interact toxically in health-related online discussions. Applying a Collaborative Filtering-based Machine Learning methodology, we predict the toxicity in COVID-related conversations between any user and subcommunity of Reddit, surpassing 80% predictive performance in relevant metrics, and allowing us to prevent the pairing of conflicting users and subcommunities.</description>

      <title>Semantic Web and Software Agents -- A Forgotten Wave of Artificial Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a narrative of waves -- rising optimism followed by crashing disappointments. AI winters, such as the early 2000s, are often remembered as barren periods of innovation. This paper argues that such a perspective overlooks a crucial wave of AI that seems to be forgotten: the rise of the Semantic Web, which is based on knowledge representation, logic, and reasoning, and its interplay with intelligent Software Agents. Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models. However, before Large Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conversation, another ambitious vision emerged -- one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web users based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed to transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason, understand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant research boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted elsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this overlooked wave. By analyzing its academic impact through bibliometric data, we highlight the Semantic Web's role in AI history and its untapped potential for modern Software Agent development. Recognizing this forgotten chapter not only deepens our understanding of AI's cyclical evolution but also offers key insights for integrating emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying urban socio-economic segregation through co-residence network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban segregation poses a critical challenge in cities, exacerbating inequalities, social tensions, fears, and polarization. It emerges from a complex interplay of socio-economic disparities and residential preferences, disproportionately impacting migrant communities. In this paper, using a comprehensive administrative data from Vienna, where nearly 40% of the population consists of international migrants, we analyse co-residence preferences between migrants and locals at the neighbourhood level. Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. These insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.</description>
