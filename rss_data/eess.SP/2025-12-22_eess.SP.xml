      <title>Packet Detection in a Filter Bank-Based Ultra-Wideband Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to generate UWB signals, without requiring a high-rate analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog converter. In this paper, beginning with a design operating on a single signal processor, we explore the development of a packet detector using the Rao score test. Taking advantage of the FBMC-SS signal structure, an effective detector design based on a cascade channelizer is proposed. We refer to this design as singe-radio band (SRB) detector. Given the typical bandwidth of UWB systems ($\bf 500$~MHz or wider), the SRB detector has to operate at a fast sampling rate of greater than $\bf 500$~MHz. This may be undesirable, as low cost analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often limited to a sampling rate of $\bf 200$~MHz or lower. Taking note of this point, the proposed SRB detector is extended to a multi-radio band (MRB) detector, where a set of parallel signal processors operating at a moderate sampling rate are used for a more practical implementation of the detector. Through computer simulations, we show that SRB and MRB detectors have the same performance in typical UWB channels. Finally, we provide results from an over-the-air demonstration of a UWB design occupying $\bf 1.28$~GHz of bandwidth. We find that reliable detection performance is possible in the harshest environments, at signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\bf -40$~dB with a preamble length of approximately half the duration of longest preamble length recommended in the IEEE802.15.4 standard.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Meets Horvitz and Thompson: Estimating Homophily in Large Networks via Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing homophily in large-scale networks is central to understanding structural regularities in graphs, and thus inform the choice of models (such as graph neural networks) adopted to learn from network data. Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filter-based Mobile User-RIS Channel Estimation and User Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In communication networks, channel estimation and user localization are challenging problems in harsh environments or signal-blocked areas. This paper introduces a novel approach to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in channel estimation between mobile users and rectangular Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) within wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, the user localization is realized based on the estimated Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, we assume a non-linear, user's position-dependent system model, for a user with high mobility, an RIS with multiple elements, and a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. After that, we apply the Kalman Filtering (KF) like algorithms to reduce MSE in estimating parameters of this time-variant channel model. Additionally, we propose a Non-Circular Noise Kalman Filter (NCNKF) to address scenarios with non-circular complex state-space noise. Furthermore, we apply the Discrete Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) method, combined with the interpolation techniques to decrease the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the user localization based on the estimated CSI. Finally, we extend the single-user case into the multi-user situation. Results show that KF can achieve lower MSE in estimating the channel than other known approaches, while the NCNKF algorithm has better performance in non-circular state-space noise scenarios. At the same time, the DSFT interpolation outperforms the other approaches with lower complexity. The study concludes with numerical comparisons and an in-depth discussion of the performance improvements enabled by our approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled Multi-Tag Detection in Ambient Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables battery-free connectivity by letting passive tags modulate existing RF signals, but reliable detection of multiple tags is challenging due to strong direct link interference, very weak backscatter signals, and an exponentially large joint state space. Classical multi-hypothesis likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are optimal for this task when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, yet in AmBC such CSI is difficult to obtain and track because the RF source is uncooperative and the tags are low-power passive devices. We first derive analytical performance bounds for an LRT receiver with perfect CSI to serve as a benchmark. We then propose two complementary deep learning frameworks that relax the CSI requirement while remaining modulation-agnostic. EmbedNet is an end-to-end prototypical network that maps covariance features of the received signal directly to multi-tag states. ChanEstNet is a hybrid scheme in which a convolutional neural network estimates effective channel coefficients from pilot symbols and passes them to a conventional LRT for interpretable multi-hypothesis detection. Simulations over diverse ambient sources and system configurations show that the proposed methods substantially reduce bit error rate, closely track the LRT benchmark, and significantly outperform energy detection baselines, especially as the number of tags increases.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Strategies for Big Data Offloading in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider vehicular networking scenarios where existing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links can be leveraged for an effective uploading of large-size data to the network. In particular, we consider a group of vehicles where one vehicle can be designated as the \textit{leader} and other \textit{follower} vehicles can offload their data to the leader vehicle or directly upload it to the base station (or a combination of the two). In our proposed framework, the leader vehicle is responsible for receiving the data from other vehicles and processing it in order to remove the redundancy (deduplication) before uploading it to the base station. We present a mathematical framework of the considered network and formulate two separate optimization problems for minimizing (i) total time and (ii) total energy consumption by vehicles for uploading their data to the base station. We employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tools to obtain solutions in a dynamic vehicular network where network parameters (e.g., vehicle locations and channel coefficients) vary over time. Our results demonstrate that the application of DRL is highly beneficial, and data offloading with deduplication can significantly reduce the time and energy consumption. Furthermore, we present comprehensive numerical results to validate our findings and compare them with alternative approaches to show the benefits of the proposed DRL methods.</description>

      <title>BM4D-PC: nonlocal volumetric denoising of principal components of diffusion-weighted MR images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Noise in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is often spatially correlated due to different acquisition and reconstruction strategies, which is not fully accounted for in current denoising strategies. Thus, we propose a novel model-based denoising method for dMRI that effectively accounts for the different noise characteristics of data. Methods: We propose a denoising strategy that incorporates full noise statistics, including the noise power spectral density (PSD), by leveraging the BM4D algorithm. Furthermore, to exploit redundancy across the diffusion MRI dataset, BM4D is applied to principal components (PC) of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the entire DWI dataset, an approach we refer to as BM4D-PC. Importantly, our method also allows for direct estimation of both the noise map and PSD. We evaluated BM4D-PC against four existing state-of-the-art methods using in-silico and in vivo datasets, including high-resolution human and marmoset acquisitions. Results: Overall, BM4D-PC presented the best results for the metrics PSNR, SSIM and RMSE on the in-silico experiments. The in-vivo studies also showed that BM4D-PC dramatically enhanced the image quality of raw DWIs, outperforming existing denoising methods in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation, leading to improved quality of diffusion metrics. Conclusion: The proposed BM4D-PC method demonstrated state-of-the-art denoising results for dMRI using datasets from various acquisition strategies and image resolutions, potentially supporting future advances in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>RSMA-Assited and Transceiver-Coordinated ICI Management for MIMO-OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility scenarios are becoming increasingly critical in next-generation communication systems. While multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) stands as a prominent technology, its performance in such scenarios is fundamentally limited by Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI). Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), recognized as a key multiple access technique for future communications, demonstrates superior interference management capabilities that we leverage to address this challenge. In specific, we propose a novel RSMA-assisted and transceiver-coordinated transmission scheme for ICI management in MIMO-OFDM system: (1) At the receiver side, we develop a hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) architecture with dynamic subcarrier clustering, which enables parallel intra-cluster and serial inter-cluster processing to balance complexity and performance. (2) At the transmitter~side, we design a matched hybrid precoding through formulated sum-rate maximization, solved via our proposed augmented boundary-compressed particle swarm optimization (ABC-PSO) algorithm for analog phase optimization and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based digital precoding iteration. Simulation results show that our scheme brings effective ICI suppression and enhanced system capacity with controlled complexity.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Position and Orientation Tracking With Hybrid ELAA Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates near-field (NF) position and orientation tracking of a multi-antenna mobile station (MS) using an extremely large antenna array (ELAA)-equipped base station (BS) with a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Under this hybrid array architecture, the received uplink pilot signal at the BS is first combined by analog phase shifters, producing a low-dimensional observation before digital processing. Such analog compression provides only partial access to the ELAA measurement, making it essential to design an analog combiner that can preserve pose-relevant signal components despite channel uncertainty and unit-modulus hardware constraints. To address this, we propose a predictive analog combining-assisted extended Kalman filter (PAC-EKF) framework, where the analog combiner can leverage the temporal correlation in the MS pose variation to capture the most informative signal components predictively. We then analyze fundamental performance limits via Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound and Fisher information matrix, explicitly quantifying how the analog combiner, array size, signal-to-noise ratio, and MS pose influence the pose information contained in the uplink observation. Building on these insights, we develop two methods for designing a low-complexity analog combiner. Numerical results show that the proposed predictive analog combining approach significantly improves tracking accuracy, even with fewer RF chains and lower transmit power.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multi-User Communications via Polar-Domain Beamfocusing: Analytical Framework and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless systems evolve toward higher frequencies and extremely large antenna arrays, near-field (NF) propagation becomes increasingly dominant. Unlike far-field (FF) communication, which relies on a planar-wavefront model and is limited to angular-domain beamsteering, NF propagation exhibits spherical wavefronts that enable beamfocusing in both angle and distance, i.e., the polar domain, offering new opportunities for spatial multiple access. This paper develops an analytical stochastic geometry (SG) framework for a multi-user system assisted by polar-domain beamfocusing, which jointly captures NF propagation characteristics and the spatial randomness of user locations. The intrinsic coupling between angle and distance in the NF antenna pattern renders inter-user interference analysis intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a tractable near-field multi-level antenna pattern (NF-MLAP) approximation, which enables computationally efficient expressions and tight upper bounds for key performance metrics, including coverage probability, spectrum efficiency, and area spectrum efficiency. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately captures performance trends and reveals fundamental trade-offs between hardware configuration (including the number of antennas and radio frequency chains) and system performance (in terms of spatial resource reuse and interference mitigation).</description>

      <title>OpenPathNet: An Open-Source RF Multipath Data Generator for AI-Driven Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies is driving an urgent need for large-scale, high-fidelity, and reproducible radio frequency (RF) datasets. Existing resources, such as CKMImageNet, primarily provide preprocessed and image-based channel representations, which conceal the fine-grained physical characteristics of signal propagation that are essential for effective AI modeling. To bridge this gap, we present OpenPathNet, an open-source RF multipath data generator accompanied by a publicly released dataset for AI-driven wireless research. Distinct from prior datasets, OpenPathNet offers disaggregated and physically consistent multipath parameters, including per-path gain, time of arrival (ToA), and spatial angles, derived from high-precision ray tracing simulations constructed on real-world environment maps. By adopting a modular, parameterized pipeline, OpenPathNet enables reproducible generation of multipath data and can be readily extended to new environments and configurations, improving scalability and transparency. The released generator and accompanying dataset provide an extensible testbed that holds promise for advancing studies on channel modeling, beam prediction, environment-aware communication, and integrated sensing in AI-enabled 6G systems. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/liu-lz/OpenPathNet.</description>

      <title>Content-Aware RSMA-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems for Latency Optimization in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pinching Antenna System (PAS) has emerged as a promising technology to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments in 6G networks. By activating radiating elements at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, PAS can establish strong line-of-sight (LoS) links with users, significantly enhancing channel gain and deployment flexibility, particularly in high-frequency bands susceptible to severe path loss. To further improve multi-user performance, this paper introduces a novel content-aware transmission framework that integrates PAS with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Unlike conventional RSMA, the proposed RSMA scheme enables users requesting the same content to share a unified private stream, thereby mitigating inter-user interference and reducing power fragmentation. We formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing the average system latency by dynamically adapting both antenna positioning and RSMA parameters according to channel conditions and user requests. A Content-Aware RSMA and Pinching-antenna Joint Optimization (CARP-JO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the non-convex problem into tractable subproblems solved via bisection search, convex programming, and golden-section search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CARP-JO scheme consistently outperforms Traditional RSMA, NOMA, and Fixed-antenna systems across diverse network scenarios in terms of latency, underscoring the effectiveness of co-designing physical-layer reconfigurability with intelligent communication strategies.</description>

      <title>Active RIS-Aided Anti-Jamming Wireless Communications: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive threat of jamming attacks, particularly from adaptive jammers capable of optimizing their strategies, poses a significant challenge to the security and reliability of wireless communications. This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications.</description>

      <title>SCAR: Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation via Spatiotemporal Manifold Optimization in ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis have achieved expert-level performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac waveforms. Furthermore, traditional "invisible" attacks are easily dismissed by clinicians as technical artifacts, failing to compromise the human-in-the-loop diagnostic pipeline. In this study, we propose SCAR (Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation), a novel UAP framework tailored to bypass the clinical "Human Firewall." Unlike traditional approaches, SCAR integrates spatiotemporal smoothing (W=25, approx. 50ms), spectral consistency (&lt;15 Hz), and anatomical amplitude constraints (&lt;0.2 mV) directly into the gradient optimization manifold.
  Results: We benchmarked SCAR against a rigorous baseline (Standard Universal DeepFool with post-hoc physiological filtering). While the baseline suffers a performance collapse (~16% success rate on transfer tasks), SCAR maintains robust transferability (58.09% on ResNet) and achieves 82.46% success on the source model. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals an emergent targeted behavior: SCAR specifically converges to forging Myocardial Infarction features (90.2% misdiagnosis) by mathematically reconstructing pathological ST-segment elevations. Finally, we demonstrate that SCAR serves a dual purpose: it not only functions as a robust data augmentation strategy for Hybrid Adversarial Training, offering optimal clinical defense, but also provides effective educational samples for training clinicians to recognize low-cost, AI-targeted semantic forgeries.</description>

      <title>Sub-6 GHz Beam-Reconfigurable Microfluidic Antenna Using Graphene Liquid for 5G Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless communication systems continue to grow rapidly, high-performance antennas become increasingly crucial for expanding coverage, improving capacity, and enhancing transmission quality. In light of this, research has focused considerable attention on liquid antennas due to their unique characteristics, which include small size, flexibility, reconfigurability and transparency. Recently, graphene liquid has been explored for numerous applications due to its low cost, high conductivity, flexibility, and ease of processing. Specifically for antenna applications, graphene liquid performs better than conventional liquid metal. This paper presents a graphene-liquid antenna with beam reconfiguration ability for sub-6 GHz communication system. The graphene-liquid movement within the microfluidic channel is taken into consideration by the reconfiguration mechanism. The antenna achieves beam reconfiguration in 360{\deg} directions with 6 dBi of gain at 5.5 GHz, featuring a wideband impedance bandwidth of 24%. The antenna main beam is specifically reconfigured into six directions (0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 135{\deg}, 180{\deg}, 225{\deg} and 315{\deg}) at 5.5 GHz. Additionally, in all six reconfigurable scenarios at 5.5 GHz, the antenna provides a stable reflection coefficient. Therefore, for the next generation of wireless communication systems, this novel design of graphene-liquid-based reconfigurable sub-6 GHz antennas holds promise.</description>

      <title>Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Nonlinear Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Augmented Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Both Low PAPR Signaling and Diversity Gain Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research results on Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) reveal that it experiences the same Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem as conventional Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). On the other side, some references and also our studies demonstrate that AFDM involves an unneeded matrix, which is based on a parameter typically represented by $c_2$, for signalling. Hence, in this paper, an augmented AFDM scheme, referred to as A$^2$FDM, is proposed to mitigate the PAPR problem of AFDM, which is achieved by replacing the $c_2$ matrix in AFDM by a new unitary matrix that performs both sub-block-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and symbol mapping. Two symbol mapping schemes, namely interleaved mapping and localized mapping, are proposed for implementing A$^2$FDM, yielding the Interleaved A$^2$FDM and Localized A$^2$FDM. The input-output relationships of these schemes are derived and the complexity and the effects of system parameters on the performance of A$^2$FDM along with AFDM systems are analyzed. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to demonstrate and compare comprehensively the performance of the considered schemes in conjunction with different system settings and various operational conditions. Our studies and results demonstrate that, while A$^2$FDM is capable of circumventing the PAPR problem faced by AFDM, it is capable of attaining the achievable diversity gain, when AFDM is operated in its undesirable conditions resulting in the loss of the diversity gain available.</description>

      <title>Bridging simulation and reality in subsurface radar-based sensing: physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation with deep adversarial learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of subsurface material properties, such as soil moisture, is critical for wildfire risk assessment and precision agriculture. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive geophysical technique widely used to characterize subsurface conditions. Data-driven parameter estimation methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain from real-world GPR scans under diverse subsurface conditions. A physics-based GPR model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to generate large synthetic datasets through simulations across varying material parameters, which are then utilized to train data-driven models. A key limitation, however, is that simulated data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain) often follow different distributions, which can cause data-driven models trained on simulations to underperform in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation framework with deep adversarial learning for robust subsurface material property estimation from GPR signals. The proposed framework is systematically evaluated through the laboratory tests for single- and two-layer materials, as well as the field tests for single- and two-layer materials, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and domain adversarial neural network (DANN). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher correlation coefficients R and lower Bias between the predicted and measured parameter values, along with smaller standard deviations in the estimations, thereby validating their effectiveness in bridging the domain gap between simulated and real-world radar signals and enabling efficient subsurface material property retrieval.</description>

      <title>Novel Double-Chirp Preamble Design for Multiuser Asynchronous Massive MIMO LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel preamble design and detection method for multiuser asynchronous massive MIMO LoRa networks. Unlike existing works, which only consider the preamble detection for a single target end devices (ED), we proposed to simultaneously detect the preambles of multiple EDs that asynchronously transmit their uplink (UL) packets to a multiple-antenna gateway (GW). First we show that the preamble detection in multiuser LoRa networks with the conventional single-chirp preamble suffers from the so-called preamble resemblance effect. This means that the preamble of any single ED can resemble the preambles of all EDs in the network, and make it impossible to determine to which ED a preamble belongs. To address this problem, a novel double-chirp preamble design and a preamble assignment method are proposed, which can mitigate the preamble resemblance effect by making the preamble of each ED unique and recognizable. Next, a maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection scheme for the proposed double-chirp preamble is derived. Finally, since the proposed algorithm requires the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) every sampling period, we proposed a low-complexity technique to calculate the DFT recursively to reduce the complexity of our proposed design. Simulation shows that the proposed preamble detection design and detection requires just about 2 dB more power to increase the number of EDs from one to 15 in the Rayleigh fading channel while achieving the same preamble detection error performance.</description>

      <title>BIONIX: A Wireless, Low-Cost Prosthetic Arm with Dual-Signal EEG and EMG Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.</description>

      <title>Fault Diagnosis and Quantification for Photovoltaic Arrays based on Differentiable Physical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate fault diagnosis and quantification are essential for the reliable operation and intelligent maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection. This paper presents a system model and performance analysis of a Rydberg atom-based quantum radar, which employs optical readout via lasers and photon detectors instead of circuit-based receivers. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.</description>

      <title>A 14ns-Latency 9Gb/s 0.44mm$^2$ 62pJ/b Short-Blocklength LDPC Decoder ASIC in 22FDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is a key part of 5G wireless systems. Achieving low latency necessitates codes with short blocklengths for which polar codes with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding typically outperform message-passing (MP)-based decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, SCL decoders are known to exhibit high latency and poor area efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new short-blocklength multi-rate binary LDPC code that outperforms the 5G-LDPC code for the same blocklength and is suitable for URLLC applications using fully parallel MP. To demonstrate our code's efficacy, we present a 0.44mm$^2$ GlobalFoundries 22FDX LDPC decoder ASIC which supports three rates and achieves the lowest-in-class decoding latency of 14ns while reaching an information throughput of 9Gb/s at 62pJ/b energy efficiency for a rate-1/2 code with 128-bit blocklength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of spectro-temporal unitary transforms for coherent optical modulation. Unlike conventional IQ modulation, such transforms are based on a cascade of phase modulators and dispersive elements, so are theoretically lossless and not limited by the bandwidth of the constituent modulators. We analyse the performance limits and design trade-offs of this scheme: estimating how the number of stages, amount of dispersion, modulator bandwidth, symbol block length and electrical signal power impacts the achievable signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). Importantly, we show that high (&gt;30 dB) SDRs suitable for modern &gt;200 GBd class coherent optical communications are achievable with a low (&lt;6) number of stages and reasonable parameters for driver power, modulator bandwidth and on-chip dispersion. Finally we address the SDR penalties associated with potential phase, amplitude, or dispersion errors, and limited DAC resolution.</description>

      <title>Joint Coverage and Electromagnetic Field Exposure Analysis in Downlink and Uplink for RIS-assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks remain open issues. This paper proposes a stochastic geometry (SG) based framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.</description>

      <title>A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently, channel reciprocity. In contrast to conventional reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and diagonal (D)-RIS that are constrained by circuit and channel reciprocity such that they only allow bidirectional communications, i.e., between UE1 and UE2, NR-BD-RIS can additionally enable uni-directional communications, that is, UE1 to UE2 to UE3, hence effectively enabling a wireless circulator. Specifically, this paper introduces a novel application of NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses signal from all other users (UE), and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect, the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate an sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS outperforms conventional R-BD-RIS and D-RIS in terms of sum-rate and secrecy rate.</description>

      <title>From Raw Gaze to Meaningful Features: Assessment of Visual Behavior in Driving Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel quantitative analytical approach to investigate eye movement behaviour in a driving simulator during three conditions: Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated drive under reduced visibility) is presented. We illustrate the proposed approach in a case study: eye tracking data from 24 participants are analyzed using 31 parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Across all feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between Baseline and the simulated drive conditions. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of 13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional gaze features, such as Mean Squared Error and entropy metrics, a new metric, inspired by the Guzik's Index (GI), is introduced through feature engineering to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the BCEA. The GI results suggest that gaze dispersion remains consistent across visibility conditions, but it is significantly higher during Baseline than during Fog and Ride conditions (p &lt; 0.01). Overall, the presented findings demonstrate that a combination of the BCEA-based features with saccade and blink parameters provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability in a driving simulator, while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions.</description>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) will become a service in future mobile communication networks. It enables the detection and recognition of passive objects and environments using radar-like sensing. The ultimate advantage is the reuse of the mobile network and radio access resources for scene illumination, sensing, data transportation, computation, and fusion. It enables building a distributed, ubiquitous sensing network that can be adapted for a variety of radio sensing tasks and services.
  In this article, we develop the principles of multi-sensor ISAC (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC corresponds to multi-user MIMO communication, which in radar terminology is known as distributed MIMO radar. \ First, we develop basic architectural principles for MS-ISAC and link them to example use cases. We then propose a generic MS-ISAC architecture. After a brief reference to multipath propagation and multistatic target reflectivity issues, we outline multilink access, coordination, precoding and link adaptation schemes for MS-ISAC. Moreover, we review model-based estimation and tracking of delay~/~Doppler from sparse OFDMA~/~TDMA frames. We emphasize Cooperative Passive Coherent Location (CPCL) for bistatic correlation and synchronization. Finally, issues of multisensor node synchronization and distributed data fusion are addressed.</description>

Abstract: As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Despite the development of numerous algorithms to address this challenge, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the optimal recovery error is still lacking. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems in the uplink scenario and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the recovery error for solutions to the constrained least-squares optimization problem, as well as a minimax lower bound for the considered model. Our analysis demonstrates that the recovery error decreases inversely with the number of time slots, and increases proportionally with the total number of unknown entries in the channel matrices, thereby quantifying the fundamental trade-offs in channel estimation accuracy. In addition, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we have performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.</description>
