      <title>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Mixed-symmetry superconductivity and the energy gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the ``gap'', provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we continue to investigate the possible symmetries that can arise, particularly below $T_c$, for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below $T_c$. The result is a very different signature near $T_c$ compared to that near $T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.</description>

      <title>Probing the flat-band limit of the superconducting proximity effect in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Cu NMR study of lightly doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a single crystal Cu NMR study of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with hole doping levels between $x=2$\% and $8$\%. Measurements with short spin echo times enable us to systematically study the local properties of the electronic spin system in the region of the phase diagram where the material evolves from the insulating antiferromagnetic parent phase to the superconducting state. We find evidence for qualitative changes as the Sr concentration increases through $x=5$\% in both NMR spectra and relaxation times, which we interpret as signatures of a low-temperature transition from a state with disconnected metallic islands to a granular metal with tunneling between the grains. These results provide microscopic insight into the physics of a doped charge-transfer insulator in the presence of quenched substitutional disorder, indicate that a connectivity transition occurs, and demonstrate that complex nanoscale electronic phase separation is ubiquitous in LSCO around the doping level where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic pairing in graphene quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting instabilities of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moir\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. We have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the dipole-dipole interaction, and thereby sensitive to vortex dynamics and vortex pinning.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Boosting superconductivity: how nanofaceted surfaces transform the ground state of ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>A New Bite Into Dark Matter with the SNSPD-Based QROCODILE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>
