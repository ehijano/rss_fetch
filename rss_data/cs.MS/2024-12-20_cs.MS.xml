      <title>A Fully Adaptive Radau Method for the Efficient Solution of Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations at Low Tolerances</title>

Abstract: Radau IIA methods, specifically the adaptive order radau method in Fortran due to Hairer, are known to be state-of-the-art for the high-accuracy solution of highly stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the traditional implementation was specialized to a specific range of tolerance, in particular only supporting 5th, 9th, and 13th order versions of the tableau and only derived in double precision floating point, thus limiting the ability to be truly general purpose for highly accurate scenarios. To alleviate these constraints, we implement an adaptive-time adaptive-order Radau method which can derive the coefficients for the Radau IIA embedded tableau to any order on the fly to any precision. Additionally, our Julia-based implementation includes many modernizations to improve performance, including improvements to the order adaptation scheme and improved linear algebra integrations. In a head-to-head benchmark against the classic Fortran implementation, we demonstrate our implementation is approximately 2x across a range of stiff ODEs. We benchmark our algorithm against several well-reputed numerical integrators for stiff ODEs and find state-of-the-art performance on several test problems, with a 1.5-times speed-up over common numerical integrators for stiff ODEs when low error tolerance is required. The newly implemented method is distributed in open source software for free usage on stiff ODEs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-Specific Calibration via Differentiable Hemodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</description>
