      <title>Flexibility in noisy cell-to-cell information dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange of molecules allows cells to exchange information. How robust is the information to changes in cell parameters? We use a mapping between the stochastic dynamics of two cells sharing a stimulatory molecule, and parameters akin to an extension of Landau's equilibrium phase transition theory. We show that different single-cell dynamics lead to the same dynamical response -- a flexibility that cells can use. The companion equilibrium Landau model behaves similarly, thereby describing the dynamics of information in a broad class of models with coupled order parameters.</description>

      <title>Full Identification of a Growing and Branching Network's Spatio-Temporal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally monitoring the kinematics of branching network growth is a tricky task, given the complexity of the structures generated in three dimensions. One option is to drive the network in such a way as to obtain two-dimensional growth, enabling a collection of independent images to be obtained. The density of the network generates ambiguous structures, such as overlaps and meetings, which hinder the reconstruction of the chronology of connections. In this paper, we propose a general method for global network reconstruction. Each network connection is defined by a unique label, enabling it to be tracked in time and space. In this work, we distinguish between lateral and apical branches on the one hand, and extremities on the other. Finally, we reconstruct the network after identifying and eliminating overlaps. This method is then applied to the model filamentous fungus Podospora anserina to reconstruct its growing thallus. We derive criteria for differentiating between apical and lateral branches. We find that the outer ring is favorably composed of apical branches, while densification within the network comes from lateral branches. From this, we derive the specific dynamics of each of the two types. Finally, in the absence of any latency phase during growth initiation, we can reconstruct a time based on the equality of apical and lateral branching collections. This makes it possible to directly compare the growth dynamics of different thalli.</description>

      <title>Unveiling mussel plaque core ductility: the role of pore distribution and hierarchical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mussel thread-plaque system exhibits strong adhesion and high ductility, allowing it to adhere to various surfaces. While the microstructure of plaques has been thoroughly studied, the effect of their unique porous structure on ductility remains unclear. This study firstly investigated the porous structure of mussel plaque cores using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-dimensional (2D) porous representative volume elements (RVEs) with scaled distribution parameters were generated, and the calibrated phase-field modelling method was applied to analyse the effect of the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure on the failure mechanism of porous RVEs. The SEM analysis revealed that large-scale pores exhibited a lognormal size distribution and a uniform spatial distribution. Simulations showed that increasing the normalised mean radius value of the large-scale pore distribution can statistically lead to a decreasing trend in ductility, strength and strain energy, but cannot solely determine their values. The interaction between pores can lead to two different failure modes under the same pore distribution: progressive failure mode and sudden failure mode. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of multi-scale porous RVEs can further increase ductility by 40%-60% compared to single-scale porous RVEs by reducing stiffness, highlighting the hierarchical structure could be another key factor contributing to the high ductility. These findings deepen our understanding of how the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure in mussel plaques contribute to their high ductility and affect other mechanical properties, providing valuable insights for the future design of highly ductile biomimetic materials.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mesoscopic Larmor Frequency Shifts in White Matter with Diffusion MRI -- An In-Silico Monte-Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to validate if MRI can measure anisotropic mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts from white matter axonal microstructure relative to the B0 direction and if dMRI can estimate this anisotropy. Recent models describe how mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons, described by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show MRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its orientation dependence.</description>

      <title>Src Kinase Slows Collective Rotation of Confined Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective cell migration is key during development, wound healing and metastasis and relies on coordinated cell behaviors at the group level. Src kinase is a signalling enzyme regulating many cellular processes including adhesion and motility and its deregulated activation has been associated to aggressiveness of different cancers. Here, we take advantage of optogenetics to precisely control Src activation in time to study the effect of its over activation on collective rotation of confined monolayers. We show that Src activation slows down collective rotation of epithelial cells confined into circular adhesive patches. We interpret velocity, force and stress data during period of non-activation and period of activation of Src thanks to an hydrodynamic description of the cell assembly as a polar active fluid. Src activation leads to a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of polar angle to friction, which could result from increased adhesive bonds at the cell-substrate interface. Our work reveals the importance of fine-tuning the level of Src activity for coordinated collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Multicell-Fold: geometric learning in folding multicellular life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in the chemosensory array reveals mechanisms for dissipation-enhanced cooperative sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Escherichia coli chemoreceptors form an extensive array that achieves cooperative and adaptive sensing of extracellular signals. The receptors control the activity of histidine kinase CheA, which drives a nonequilibrium phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle for response regulator CheY. Cooperativity and dissipation are both important aspects of chemotaxis signaling, yet their consequences have only been studied separately. Recent single-cell FRET measurements revealed that kinase activity of the array spontaneously switches between active and inactive states, with asymmetric switching times that signify time-reversal symmetry breaking in the underlying dynamics. Here, we present a nonequilibrium lattice model of the chemosensory array, which demonstrates that the observed asymmetric switching dynamics can only be explained by an interplay between the dissipative reactions within individual core units and the cooperative coupling between neighboring units. Microscopically, the switching time asymmetry originates from irreversible transition paths. The model shows that strong dissipation enables sensitive and rapid signaling response by relieving the speed-sensitivity trade-off, which can be tested by future single-cell experiments. Overall, our model provides a general framework for studying biological complexes composed of coupled subunits that are individually driven by dissipative cycles and the rich nonequilibrium physics within.</description>

      <title>Active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration coupling actin flow and adhesion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Migration of animal cells is based on the interplay between actin polymerization at the front, adhesion along the cell-substrate interface, and actomyosin contractility at the back. Active gel theory has been used before to demonstrate that actomyosin contractility is sufficient for polarization and self-sustained cell migration in the absence of external cues, but did not consider the dynamics of adhesion. Likewise, migration models based on the mechanosensitive dynamics of adhesion receptors usually do not include the global dynamics of intracellular flow. Here we show that both aspects can be combined in a minimal active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration with dynamic adhesion. This model demonstrates that load sharing between the adhesion receptors leads to symmetry breaking, with stronger adhesion at the front, and that bistability of migration arises for intermediate adhesiveness. Local variations in adhesiveness are sufficient to switch between sessile and motile states, in qualitative agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, which are limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data for a planar cluster. We then extended it to three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and power law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters as a function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all the clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely the permeability and tortuosity of the bacterial colonies.</description>
