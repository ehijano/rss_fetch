      <title>A Bound on Topological Gap from Newton's Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking general bound on the energy gap in topological matter was recently discovered in Ref. [Onishi and Fu, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011052 (2024)]. A non-trivial indirect derivation builds on the properties of optical conductivity at an arbitrary frequency. We propose a simpler derivation, allowing multiple generalizations, such as a universal bound on a gap in anisotropic systems, systems with multiple charge carrier types, and topological systems with zero Hall conductance. The derivation builds on the observation that the bound equals $\hbar$ times the ratio of the force by the external electric field on the charge carriers and their total kinematic momentum in the direction perpendicular to the force.</description>

      <title>Robust Room-Temperature Polariton Condensation and Lasing in Scalable FAPbBr$_3$ Perovskite Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton condensation in direct bandgap semiconductors strongly coupled to light enables a broad range of fundamental studies and applications like low-threshold and electrically driven lasing. Yet, materials hosting exciton-polariton condensation in ambient conditions are rare, with fabrication protocols that are often inefficient and non-scalable. Here, room-temperature exciton-polariton condensation and lasing is observed in a microcavity with embedded formamidiniumlead bromide (FAPbBr$_3$) perovskite film. This optically active material is spin-coated onto the microcavity mirror, which makes the whole device scalable up to large lateral sizes. The sub-$\mu$m granulation of the polycrystalline FAPbBr$_3$ film allows for observation of polariton lasing in a single quantum-confined mode of a polaritonic 'quantum dot'. Compared to random photon lasing, observed in bare FAPbBr$_3$ films, polariton lasing exhibits a lower threshold, narrower linewidth, and an order of magnitude longer coherence time. Both polariton and random photon lasing are observed under the conditions of pulsed optical pumping, and persist without significant degradation for up to 6 and 17 hours of a continuous experimental run, respectively. This study demonstrates the excellent potential of the FAPbBr$_3$ perovskite as a new material for room-temperature polaritonics, with the added value of efficient and scalable fabrication offered by the solution-based spin-coating process.</description>

      <title>Phonon dispersion of nanoscale honeycomb phononic crystal: gigahertz and terahertz spectroscopy comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons-quantized vibrational modes in crystalline structures-govern phenomena ranging from thermal and mechanical transport to quantum mechanics. In recent years, a new class of artificial materials called phononic crystals has emerged, aiming to control phononic properties. These materials are created by introducing a superlattice structure on top of an already-existing atomic lattice. Typically, phononic crystals are described using a continuous model, in which effective elastic constants approximate potentials between atoms. This approximation, however, assumes the wavelengths of vibrations to be significantly greater than the interatomic distance. In this work, we experimentally investigate the behavior of a honeycomb silicon phononic crystal in the gigahertz range, where the continuum approximation holds, and in the terahertz range, where the phonon wavelengths are comparable to interatomic distances. Using Brillouin light scattering, we investigate the phonon dispersion of the phononic crystal in the gigahertz range, finding a close match with simulations based on the continuous model. Conversely, Raman spectroscopy reveals no difference between the phononic crystal, an unpatterned membrane, and a bulk silicon structure in the terahertz range, showing that the continuous model no longer holds at these higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nonlinear Spin Hall Effect and Manipulation of Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an intrinsic nonlinear spin Hall effect, which enables the generation of collinearly-polarized spin current in a large class of nonmagnetic materials with the corresponding linear response being symmetry-forbidden. This opens a new avenue for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization, which is required for the next-generation information storage technology. We develop the microscopic theory of this effect, and clarify its quantum origin in band geometric quantities which can be enhanced by topological nodal features. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict pronounced effects at room temperature in topological metals $\mathrm{PbTaSe_{2}}$ and PdGa. Our work establishes a fundamental nonlinear response in spin transport, and opens the door to exploring spintronic applications based on nonlinear spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Two-strand ladder network variants: localization, multifractality, and quantum dynamics under an Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper kind of quasiperiodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate, using a couple of variants of a two-strand ladder network that, a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) modulation applied to the vertical strands, mimicking a deterministic distortion in the network, can give rise to certain exotic features in the electronic spectrum of such systems. While, for the simplest ladder network all the eigenstates become localized as the modulation strength crosses a threshold, for the second variant, modelling an ultrathin graphene nano-ribbon, the central part of the energy spectrum remains populated by extended wavefunctions. The multifractal character in the energy spectrum is observed for both these networks close to the critical values of the modulation. We substantiate our findings also by studying the quantum dynamics of a wave packet on such decorated lattices. Interestingly, while the mean square displacement (MSD) changes in the usual manner in a pure two-strand ladder network as the modulation strength varies, for the ultrathin graphene nanoribbon the temporal behaviour of the MSD remains unaltered only up to a strong modulation strength. This, we argue, is due to the extendedness of the wavefunction at the central part of the energy spectrum. Other measurements like the return probability, temporal autocorrelation function, the time dependence of the inverse participation ratio, and the information entropy are calculated for both networks with different modulation strengths and corroborate our analytical findings.</description>

      <title>Spectrally resolved far-field emission pattern of single photon emitters in MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the optical dipole orientation of single photon emitters in monolayer MoS2 as produced by a focused helium ion beam. The single photon emitters can be understood as single sulfur vacancies. The corresponding far-field luminescence spectra reveal several photoluminescence lines below the dominating luminescence of the exciton in MoS2. These sub-bandgap emission lines were predicted by ab initio theory, but they have never been resolved in luminescence experiments because of their small amplitude. We reveal the lines by their dependence as a function of the photon energy and momentum as measured in the back focal plane of the optical circuitry. The agreement between theory and experiment suggests that the defect states interact strongly within the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Braiding Induced by Finite-Size Effect in One-Dimensional Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of Majorana zero mode (MZM) and Majorana Kramers pair (MKP) in one-dimensional topological superconductors, respectively. An effective model is established for braiding of MZMs and MKPs. We employ the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave topological superconductors to embody the effective model for braiding of MKPs by utilizing finite-size effects and locally tunable coupling parameters. We show how to construct the state initialization and readout via gate control. We also use this method for braiding MZMs in s-wave topological superconductors. Our proposal presents a promising avenue for experimentally verifying the non-Abelian statistical properties of MZMs and MKPs, with implications for topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe2 Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a hybridized combination of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate for the first time in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers the emergence of quadrupolar excitons, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to, so far reported trilayer systems hosting quadrupolar excitons, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, a stronger interlayer hybridization, cleaner potential landscapes and inherent stability with respect to moir\'e potentials or post-stacking reconstruction. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupole excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magneto-optical response across van Hove singularity in a non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear magneto-optical response in non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals featuring a quadratic tilt, focusing particularly on the influence of the van Hove singularity (VHS). In the absence of a magnetic field, the second-order nonlinear Drude conductivity components exhibit inflection or dip behavior across the VHS. In contrast, the second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall conductivity, primarily governed by the Berry curvature dipole, manifests a subtle plateau-like structure. As the tilt strength increases, the VHS energy escalates, thereby amplifying the VHS-induced characteristics within these second-order conductivity components. However, in the presence of a magnetic field, we show that the resultant magnetic moment suppresses nonlinear electron transport while enhancing nonlinear hole transport. %both suppresses and notably enhances nonlinear magnetic-optical transport in the electron and hole regions, respectively. This effect serves to mitigate the impact of the VHS, resulting specifically in an asymmetric peak or a kinked-like structure in the magnetic field-induced contribution to the second-order nonlinear conductivity near the Weyl nodes. These findings provide new insights into the intricate interplay among the VHS, Berry curvature, and magnetic moment in nonlinear magneto-optical transport through non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>The temperature influence on the brightening of neutral and charged dark excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optically dark states play an important role in the electronic and optical properties of monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. The effect of temperature on the in-plane-field activation of the neutral and charged dark excitons is investigated in a WSe$_2$ ML encapsulated in hexagonal BN flakes. The brightening rates of the neutral dark (X$^D$) and grey (X$^G$) excitons and the negative dark trion (T$^D$) differ substantially at a particular temperature. More importantly, they vanish considerably by about 3 -- 4 orders of magnitude with the temperature increased from 4.2 K to 100 K. The quenching of the dark-related emissions is accompanied by the two-order-of-magnitude increase in the emissions of their neutral bright counterparts, $i.e.$ neutral bright exciton (X$^B$) and spin-singlet (T$^S$) and spin-triplet (T$^T$) negative trions, due to the thermal activations of dark states. Furthermore, the energy splittings between the dark X$^D$ and T$^D$ complexes and the corresponding bright X$^B$, T$^S$, and T$^T$ ones vary with temperature rises from 4.2 K to 100 K. This can be explained in terms of the different exciton-phonon couplings for the bright and dark excitons stemming from their distinct symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Mem-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of memristors and resistive switching has transformed solid state physics, enabling advanced applications such as neuromorphic computing. Inspired by these developments, we introduce the concept of Mem-emitters, devices that manipulate light emission properties of semiconductors to achieve memory functionalities. Mem-emitters, influenced by past exposure to stimuli, offer a new approach to optoelectronic computing with potential for enhanced speed, efficiency, and integration. This study explores the unique properties of transition metal dichalcogenides-based heterostructures as a promising platform for Mem-emitter functionalities due to their atomic-scale thickness, tunable electronic properties, and strong light-matter interaction. By distinguishing between population-driven and transition rate-driven Mem-emitters, we highlight their potential for various applications, including optoelectronic switches, variable light sources, and advanced communication systems. Understanding these mechanisms paves the way for innovative technologies in memory and computation, offering insights into the intrinsic dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Excitons in Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exciton is a Coulomb-driven bound state, which normally consists of an electron and a hole. Under the influence of charge fractionalization, an exotic construction of exciton arises from pairing between fractional particle and hole charge. Despite numerous theoretical considerations, experimental realization of fractional excitons remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report hallmark transport signatures of excitonic pairing that coexists with fractional quantum Hall effect states. Such coexistence reveals a new construction for fractional quantum Hall effect, where exciton pairing plays an essential role in defining the underlying wavefunction. By surveying the two-dimensional phase space defined by Landau-level filling and layer imbalance, we describe transitions between ground states with distinct exciton compositions. The hierarchical behavior of the excitonic sequence provides potential evidence for excitons with fractional charge constituents, which obey fermionic and anyonic statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a single layer of NbS$_2$ grown on graphene by molecular beam epitaxy, the single unit cell thick 2D materials Nb$_{5/3}$S$_3$-2D and Nb$_2$S$_3$-2D are created using two different pathways. Either annealing under sulfur-deficient conditions at progressively higher temperatures or deposition of increasing amounts of Nb at elevated temperature result in phase-pure Nb$_{5/3}$S$_3$-2D followed by Nb$_2$S$_3$-2D. The materials are characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental assessment combined with systematic density functional theory calculations reveals their structure. The 2D materials are covalently bound without any van der Waals gap. Their stacking sequence and structure are at variance with expectations based on corresponding bulk materials highlighting the importance of surface and interface effects in structure formation.</description>

      <title>Photon-resolved Floquet theory I: Full-Counting statistics of the driving field in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory and other established semiclassical approaches are widely used methods to predict the state of externally-driven quantum systems, yet, they do not allow to predict the state of the photonic driving field. To overcome this shortcoming, the photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) has been developed recently [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013116], which deploys concepts from full-counting statistics to predict the statistics of the photon flux between several coherent driving modes. In this paper, we study in detail the scaling properties of the PRFT in the semiclassical regime. We find that there is an ambiguity in the definition of the moment-generating function, such that different versions of the moment-generating function produce the same photonic probability distribution in the semiclassical limit, and generate the same leading-order terms of the moments and cumulants. Using this ambiguity, we establish a simple expression for the Kraus operators, which describe the decoherence dynamics of the driven quantum system appearing as a consequence of the light-matter interaction. The PRFT will pave the way for improved quantum sensing methods, e.g., for spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols, reflectometry in semiconductor nanostructures and other applications, where the detailed knowledge of the photonic probability distribution is necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mechanical oscillator coupled to a two-level system driven by a blue-detuned coherent source in the resolved sideband regime. For weak mechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles. They are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with a large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly similar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the mechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We discuss the relation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these effects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules coupled to oscillators.</description>

      <title>Lightwave-driven electrons in a Floquet topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators offer unique opportunities for novel electronics and quantum phenomena. However, intrinsic material limitations often restrict their applications and practical implementation. Over a decade ago it was predicted that a time-periodic perturbation can generate out-of-equilibrium states known as Floquet topological insulators (FTIs), hosting topologically protected transport and anomalous Hall physics, and opening routes to optically tunable bandstructures and devices compatible with petahertz electronics. Although such states have not yet been directly observed, indirect signatures such as the light-induced anomalous Hall effect were recently measured. Thus far, much remained experimentally unclear and fundamentally unknown about solid-state FTI and whether they can be employed for electronics. Here we demonstrate coherent control of photocurrents in light-dressed graphene. Circularly-polarized laser pulses dress the graphene band structure to obtain an FTI, and phase-locked second harmonic pulses drive electrons in the FTI. This approach allows us to measure resulting all-optical anomalous Hall photocurrents, FTI-valley-polarized currents, and photocurrent circular dichroism, all phenomena that put FTIs on equal footing with equilibrium topological insulators. We further present an intuitive description for the sub-optical-cycle light-matter interaction, revealing dynamical symmetry selection rules for photocurrents. All measurements are supported by strong agreement with ab-initio and analytic theory. Remarkably, the photocurrents show a strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity that can be employed for ultrafast control in topotronics and spectroscopy. Our work connects Floquet and topological physics with attoscience and valleytronics, and goes beyond band structure engineering by initiating lightwave-driven dynamics in FTI states.</description>

      <title>Experimental Data Confirm Carrier-Cascade Model for Solid-State Conductance across Proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finding that electronic conductance across ultra-thin protein films between metallic electrodes remains nearly constant from room temperature to just a few degrees Kelvin has posed a challenge. We show that a model based on a generalized Landauer formula explains the nearly constant conductance and predicts an Arrhenius-like dependence for low temperatures. A critical aspect of the model is that the relevant activation energy for conductance is either the difference between the HOMO and HOMO-1 or the LUMO+1 and LUMO energies instead of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the proteins. Analysis of experimental data confirm the Arrhenius-like law and allows us to extract the activation energies. We then calculate the energy differences with advanced DFT methods for proteins used in the experiments. Our main result is that the experimental and theoretical activation energies for these three different proteins and three differently prepared solid-state junctions match nearly perfectly, implying the mechanism's validity.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum enhancement in critical quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality is not due to the thermodynamic limit but rather to the rescaling of the system parameters. In particular, the second-order phase transitions of parametric Kerr resonators are of high experimental relevance, as they can be implemented and controlled with various quantum technologies currently available. Here, we show that collective quantum advantage can be achieved with a multipartite critical quantum sensor based on a parametrically coupled Kerr resonators chain in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of \emph{locally} critical elements. We then assess the performance of an adiabatic CQS protocol, comparing the coupled-resonator chain with an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors. We evaluate the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources, and find that the critical chain achieves a quadratic enhancement in the number of resonators. Beyond the advantage found in the case of zero Kerr, we find that there is a collective enhancement even in the scenario of finite Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping impurity atoms is a strategy commonly used to tune the functionality of materials including catalysts, semiconductors, and quantum emitters. The location of dopants and their interaction with surrounding atoms could significantly modulate the transport, optical, or magnetic properties of materials. However, directly imaging individual impurity atoms inside materials remains a generally unaddressed need. Here, we demonstrate how single atoms can be detected and located in three dimensions via multislice electron ptychography.Interstitial atoms in a complex garnet oxide heterostructure are resolved with a depth resolution better than 2.7 nm, together with a deep-sub-{\AA}ngstrom lateral resolution. Single-scan atomic-layer depth resolution should be possible using strongly divergent electron probe illumination. Our results provide a new approach to detecting individual atomic defects and open doors to characterize the local environments and spatial distributions that underlie a broad range of systems such as single-atom catalysts, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and other atomic-scale quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Andreev scattering in the $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of exotic quasiparticles may follow different rules than electrons. In the fractional quantum Hall regime, a quantum point contact (QPC) provides a source of quasiparticles with field effect selectable charges and statistics, which can be scattered on an 'analyzer' QPC to investigate these rules. Remarkably, for incident quasiparticles dissimilar to those naturally transmitted across the analyzer, electrical conduction conserves neither the nature nor the number of the quasiparticles. In contrast with standard elastic scattering, theory predicts the emergence of a mechanism akin to the Andreev reflection at a normal-superconductor interface. Here, we observe the predicted Andreev-like reflection of an $e/3$ quasiparticle into a $-2e/3$ hole accompanied by the transmission of an $e$ quasielectron. Combining shot noise and cross-correlation measurements, we independently determine the charge of the different particles and ascertain the coincidence of quasielectron and fractional hole. The present work advances our understanding on the unconventional behavior of fractional quasiparticles, with implications toward the generation of novel quasi-particles/holes and non-local entanglements.</description>

      <title>Flux-tunable Kitaev chain in a quantum dot array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting quantum dots through Andreev bound states in a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid provides a platform to create a Kitaev chain. Interestingly, in a double quantum dot, a pair of poor man's Majorana zero modes can emerge when the system is fine-tuned to a sweet spot, where superconducting and normal couplings are equal in magnitude. Control of the Andreev bound states is crucial for achieving this, usually implemented by varying its chemical potential. In this work, we propose using Andreev bound states in a short Josephson junction to mediate both types of couplings, with the ratio tunable by the phase difference across the junction. Now a minimal Kitaev chain can be easily tuned into the strong coupling regime by varying the phase and junction asymmetry, even without changing the dot-hybrid coupling strength. Furthermore, we identify an optimal sweet spot at $\pi$ phase, enhancing the excitation gap and robustness against phase fluctuations. Our proposal introduces a new device platform and a new tuning method for realizing quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits an exceptional mass resolution of 0.36 MDa, based on its outstanding mechanical quality factor and frequency stability, along with an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa. This positions the DMB at the forefront of molecular balances operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB demonstrates its ability to measure the mass of a single bacteriophage T4 by precisely locating the analyte on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass spectrometry at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to parametrically excite low frequency collective modes in an interacting many body system using a Floquet driving at optical frequencies with a modulated amplitude. We demonstrate that it can be used to design plasmonic time-varying media with singular dispersions. Plasmons near resonance with half the modulation frequency exhibit two lines of exceptional points connected by dispersionless states. Above a critical driving strength, resonant plasmon modes become unstable and undergo a continuous transition towards a crystal-like structure stabilized by interactions and nonlinearities. This new state breaks the discrete time translational symmetry of the drive as well as the translational and rotational spatial symmetries of the system and exhibits soft, Goldstone-like phononic excitations. Below the instability threshold, our method can be used to enhance the quality of plasmon resonances.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermomagnetic transport in an ultracold atomic system with two ferromagnets linked via a magnetic quantum point contact. Using nonequilibrium Green's function approach, we show a divergence in spin conductance and a slowing down of spin relaxation that manifest in the weak effective-Zeeman-field limit. These anomalous spin dynamics result from the magnonic critical point at which magnons become gapless due to spontaneous magnetization. Our findings unveil untapped dynamics in ultracold atomic systems, opening new avenues in thermomagnetism.</description>

Abstract: Low-dimensional magnetic structures coupled with superconductors are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes, which have potential applications in topological quantum computing. Here, we report a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic-superconducting heterostructure consisting of single-layer chromium diiodide (CrI2) on a niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Single-layer CrI2 nanosheets, which hold antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states by our first-principles calculations, were epitaxially grown on the layered NbSe2 substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observed robust in-gap states spatially located at the edge of the nanosheets and defect-induced zero-energy peaks inside the CrI2 nanosheets. Magnetic-flux vortices induced by an external field exhibit broken threefold rotational symmetry of pristine NbSe2 superconductor, implying the efficient modulation of the interfacial superconducting states by the epitaxial CrI2 layer. A phenomenological model suggests the existence of chiral edge states in a 2D AFM-superconducting hybrid system with an even Chern number, providing a qualitatively plausible understanding for our experimental observation.</description>
