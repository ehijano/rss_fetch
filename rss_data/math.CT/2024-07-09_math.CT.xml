      <title>Unitalities and mapping spaces in $A_\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, over any base ring, that the infinity-category of strictly unital A-infinity-categories (and strictly unital functors) is equivalent to the infinity-category of unital A-infinity-categories (and unital functors). We also identify various models for internal homs and mapping spaces in the infinity-categories of dg-categories and of A-infinity--categories, generalizing results of To\"en and Faonte.</description>

      <title>Weakly approximable triangulated categories and enhancements: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys some recent results, concerning the intrinsicness of natural subcategories of weakly approximable triangulated subcategories. We also review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated categories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we show how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about derived invariance for schemes and rings.</description>

      <title>Left-Linear Rewriting in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can two sequential steps performed by a computing device be considered (causally) independent? This is a relevant question for concurrent and distributed systems, since independence means that they could be executed in any order, and potentially in parallel. Equivalences identifying rewriting sequences which differ only for independent steps are at the core of the theory of concurrency of many formalisms. We investigate the issue in the context of the double pushout approach to rewriting in the general setting of adhesive categories. While a consolidated theory exists for linear rules,which can consume, preserve and generate entities, this paper focuses on left-linear rules which may also "merge" parts of the state. This is an apparently minimal, yet technically hard enhancement,since a standard characterisation of independence that - in the linear case - allows one to derive a number of properties, essential in the development of a theory of concurrency, no longer holds. The paper performs an in-depth study of the notion of independence for left-linear rules: it introduces a novel characterisation of independence, identifies well-behaved classes of left-linear rewriting systems,and provides some fundamental results including a Church-Rosser property and the existence of canonical equivalence proofs for concurrent computations. These results properly extends the class of formalisms that can be modelled in the adhesive framework</description>

      <title>Naturality of the $\infty$-Categorical Enriched Yoneda Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make Hinich's $\infty$-categorical enriched Yoneda embedding natural. To do so, we exhibit it as the unit of a partial adjunction between the functor taking enriched presheaves and Heine's functor taking a tensored category to an enriched category. Furthermore, we study a finiteness condition of objects in a tensored category called being atomic, and show that the partial adjunction restricts to a (non-partial) adjunction between taking enriched presheaves and taking atomic objects.</description>

      <title>Varieties of quantitative algebras as categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical varieties were characterized by Lawvere as the categories with effective congruences and a varietal generator: an abstractly finite regular generator which is regularly projective (its hom-functor preserves regular epimorphisms). We characterize varieties of quantitative algebras of Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin analogously as metric-enriched categories. We introduce the concept of a subcongruence (a metric-enriched analogue of a congruence) and the corresponding subregular epimorphisms obtained via colimits of subcongruences. Varieties of quantitative algebras are precisely the metric-enriched categories with effective subcongruences and a subvarietal generator: an abstractly finite subregular generator which is subregularly projective (its hom-functor preserves subregular epimorphisms).</description>

      <title>Relative weak global Gorenstein dimension, AB-contexts and model structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the weak Gorenstein global dimension of a ring $R$ with respect to a left $R$-module $C$. We provide several characterizations of when this homological invariant is bounded. Two main applications are given: first, we prove that the weak Gorenstein global dimension of $R$ relative to a semidualizing $(R,S)$-bimodule $C$ can be computed either by the ${\rm G_C}$-flat dimension of the left $R$-modules or right $S$-modules, just like the (absolute) weak global dimension. As a consequence, a new argument for solving Bennis' conjecture is obtained. As a second application, we give a concrete description of the weak equivalences in the ${\rm G_C}$-flat model structure recently found by the authors. In order to prove this result, an interesting connection between abelian model structures and AB-weak contexts is proved. This connection leads to a result that can be applied to obtain abelian model structures with a simpler description of trivial objects.</description>

      <title>On the Anatomy of Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category-theoretic diagrammatic formalism in order to systematically relate and reason about machine learning models. Our diagrams present architectures intuitively but without loss of essential detail, where natural relationships between models are captured by graphical transformations, and important differences and similarities can be identified at a glance. In this paper, we focus on attention mechanisms: translating folklore into mathematical derivations, and constructing a taxonomy of attention variants in the literature. As a first example of an empirical investigation underpinned by our formalism, we identify recurring anatomical components of attention, which we exhaustively recombine to explore a space of variations on the attention mechanism.</description>
