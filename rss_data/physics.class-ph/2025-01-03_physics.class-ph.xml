      <title>Analysis of nonlinear dynamics in a single magnetic pendulum driven by plate-magnet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed theoretically the nonlinear dynamics of a strong magnetic pendulum consisting of a cylindrical neodymium magnet swinging into a metal plane. The heavy damping of oscillations of the pendulum is caused by eddy currents induced in the metal plate. In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model to describe the braking force acting on the magnetic pendulum and its nonlinear motion.</description>

      <title>About the Keplerization of motion in any central force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of keplerization of one-body motion in any central force field, introduced by Martinusi and Gurfil in 2012, is reviewed and reformulated into a general homogenization method which applies to any kind of bounded motion. It is also shown how this extended method provides a proof of the existence of a dynamical symmetry group and how it can be used to extend that group to a global symmetry group, for any such system</description>

      <title>Classical Dynamical Symmetries and Geometry of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that all spherical symmetric potentials are capable of producing dynamical symmetries in classical one-body motions, thanks to the inevitable existence of symmetry axes associated with turning points for corresponding trajectories. This will definitely expand the class of maximally superintegrable one-body motions in central potentials that until now was considered to include only the Newtonian and Hookean cases. A simple method is proposed to identify and characterize these dynamical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the integral form of Gauss' law for a generic case of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have analytically examined the integral form of Gauss' law for arbitrarily moving charges inside and outside an arbitrarily expanding (or contracting) and deforming Gaussian surface with explicit use of the motion of the Gaussian surface and the Maxwell equations under consideration. We have obtained a simple-looking differential equation $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\text{t}}\oint_{s(t)}\vec{E}\cdot\text{d}\vec{s}(t)=\frac{I^{(s)}_{\text{in}}(t)}{\epsilon_0}$ for time-dependent Gauss' flux-integral. We have explicitly calculated time-dependent Gauss' flux-integral for the moving surface and have found no changes in the original result which was obtained without explicit use of the motion. Our explicit derivation of Gauss' flux-integral for the moving surface can be directly useful in an undergraduate/postgraduate physics class for a better understanding of Gauss' law for electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Endo-reversible Carnot engine: Extending the Yvon engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly referred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time thermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine, similar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special setup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper extends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to that of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon engine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work provides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the extended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>
