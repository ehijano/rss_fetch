      <title>Considerations on measuring spin-spin correlation of hyeprons in heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant global spin alignment observed for $\phi$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions has sparked intense discussions about its origin and implications. One explanation suggests that fluctuations in the strong force field may introduce strong spin correlations between strange ($s$) and anti-strange ($\bar{s}$) quarks, leading to the global spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons. Extending this line of research, the theoretical community has proposed studying the spin correlation between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons. In this paper, we construct experimental observables and make connections between them and the theoretical proposed quantities.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Isomer production studied with simultaneous decay curve analysis for alpha-particle induced reactions on natural platinum up to 29 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isomeric ratios of $^{198}$Au, $^{197}$Hg and $^{195}$Hg produced by $\alpha$-particle induced reactions on natural platinum were investigated experimentally up to 29 MeV by using the standard stacked foil activation technique and $\gamma$-ray spectrometry. The isomeric ratios of $^{197}$Hg and $^{195}$Hg determined by the conventional activation cross section formula showed strong cooling time dependence. The time dependence was resolved by adjusting the isomeric transition branching ratios for the two isotopes within a simultaneous decay curve analysis framework. Our analysis suggests 94.5$\pm$0.7% and 48.9$\pm$1.8% as the isomeric transition branching ratios of $^{197m}$Hg (24 h) and $^{195m}$Hg (42 h), respectively. The isomeric ratios and independent production cross sections of $^{198}$Au, $^{197}$Hg, $^{195}$Hg and some other Hg, Au and Pt isotopes were also measured down to 6 MeV with these corrected isomeric transition branching ratios, and compared with predictions of statistical and pre-equilibrium models by TALYS-2.0 to discuss spin cuto? parameter dependence. We found the measured isomeric ratios are better predicted if we reduce the spin cuto? parameter to half or less from that estimated with the rigid body moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Fully-equipped Spin Flip Chopper For Neutron Lifetime Experiment at J-PARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve the ''neutron lifetime puzzle,'' where measured neutron lifetimes differ depending on the measurement methods, an experiment with pulsed neutron beam at J-PARC is in progress. In this experiment, neutrons are bunched into 40-cm lengths using a spin flip chopper (SFC), where the statistical sensitivity was limited by the aperture size of the SFC. The SFC comprises three sets of magnetic supermirrors and two resonant spin flippers. In this paper, we discuss an upgrade to enlarge the apertures of the SFC. With this upgrade, the statistics per unit time of the neutron lifetime experiment increased by a factor of 2.8, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio of 250-400 comparable to the previous one. Consequently, the time required to reach a precision of 1 s in the neutron lifetime experiment was reduced from 590 to 170 days, which is a significant reduction in time. This improvement in statistic will also contribute to the reduction of systematic uncertainties, such as background evaluation, fostering further advancements in the neutron lifetime experiments at J-PARC.</description>

      <title>Interference of resonances in two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-proton ($2p$) emission from $^{16}$Ne with the time-dependent $^{14}$O$+p+p$ three-body calculations. By evaluating the survival probability, a deviation from the exponential decay is obtained, because of the interference of the $0^{+}_1$ and the $0^+_2$ resonances. For the $0^+_1$ resonance, the true emission of the spatially localized two protons is dominant if the single-particle $s_{1/2}$ resonance locates above the $2p$ energy. The $0^+_2$ resonance is predicted at $\cong 2.4$ MeV from the $2p$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>An implementation of nuclear many-body wave functions by the superposition of localized Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for the low-energy nuclear structure calculations, which describes the single-particle wave function as a superposition of localized Gaussians. It is a hybrid of the Hartree-Fock and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics models. In the numerical calculations of oxygen, calcium isotopes and 100Sn, the framework shows its potential by significantly improving upon AMD and yielding the results consistent with or even better than Hartree-Fock(-Bogoliubov) calculations based on harmonic oscillator expansions. In addition to the basic equations, general form of the matrix elements is also given.</description>
