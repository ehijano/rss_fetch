      <title>Passive quantum reference frame transformations cannot create entanglement between physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a necessary condition for subsystems to become entangled after a quantum reference frame transformation. By distinguishing between quantum systems suitable to act as reference frames and physical systems described relative to these frames, we define passive quantum reference frames and show that transformations between these cannot produce entanglement between physical systems. Our results also apply to the study of entanglement between subsystems in the perspectival framework even when there is no distinction between physical and reference systems.</description>

      <title>The Nobel Prize in physics and the contribution of Ukrainian scientists to the understanding of quantum phenomena, in particular the behavior of macroscopic systems (The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 has been awarded to John Clarke, John Martinis, and Michel Devoret for "the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit". Their achievements open up possibilities for developing the next generation of quantum technologies, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors. This article explains physical grounds of these discoveries and describes the role of earlier studies of weak superconductivity and macroscopic quantum systems by other scientists, highlighting the contribution of researchers from the B.I. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, who obtained pioneering results in this field. The paper includes short biographies of the Nobel laureates.</description>

      <title>From Cosmology to Cosmonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.</description>
