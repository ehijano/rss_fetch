      <title>A Broadband 3-D Numerical FEM Study on the Characterization of Dielectric Relaxation Processes in Soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil as a complex multi-phase porous material typical exhibits several distributed relaxation processes in the frequency range from 1 MHz to approximately 10 GHz of interest in applications. To relate physico-chemical material parameters to the dielectric relaxation behavior, measured dielectric relaxation spectra have to be parameterized. In this context, a broadband numerical 3D FEM study was carried out to analyze the possibilities and limitations in the characterization of the relaxation processes in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Lunar antineutrinos and heat: Fluxes from primordial radioactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present estimates for the fluxes of heat and antineutrinos due to primordial radioactivity within the moon. We use a radial density profile, specifying an inner core and a model-averaged crust. The $1^\circ$ by $1^\circ$ gridded crust data draw on global maps from spacecraft missions. Thickness, density, and elevation come from measurements of the gravitational field. Thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances come from measurements of the gamma ray intensity. Assuming no vertical variation of the crustal abundances predicts $302$ GW of radiogenic heating. Accepting a heat flux of $5$ mWm$^{-2}$ from the mantle plus low viscosity zone both with $Th/U\simeq3.7$ and $K/U\simeq2000$ tallies an additional $185$ GW of radiogenic heating. The corresponding antineutrino fluxes from the average crust and the mantle plus low viscosity zone are $2.02\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $6.40\times10^5$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Subsurface variations of thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances in the crust are a potentially large and not yet assessed source of uncertainty. The uncertainties reported with the radial density profile contribute $\pm1.4\times10^3$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $\pm0.6$ GW ($&lt;1$\%) to the estimates of antineutrino flux and radiogenic heating, respectively, from the mantle plus low viscosity zone.</description>

      <title>Back-Propagating Rupture: Nature, Excitation, and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations show that certain rupture phase can propagate backward relative to the earlier one during a single earthquake event. Such back-propagating rupture (BPR) was not well considered by the conventional earthquake source studies and remains a mystery to the seismological community. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of BPR, by combining theoretical considerations, numerical simulations, and observational evidences. First, we argue that BPR in terms of back-propagating stress wave is an intrinsic feature during dynamic ruptures; however, its signature can be easily masked by the destructive interference behind the primary rupture front. Then, we propose an idea that perturbation to an otherwise smooth rupture process may make some phases of BPR observable. We test and verify this idea by numerically simulating rupture propagation under a variety of perturbations, including a sudden change of stress, bulk or interfacial property and fault geometry along rupture propagation path. We further cross-validate the numerical results by available observations from laboratory and natural earthquakes, and confirm that rupture "reflection" at free surface, rupture coalescence and breakage of prominent asperity are very efficient for exciting observable BPR. Based on the simulated and observed results, we classify BPR into two general types: interface wave and high-order re-rupture, depending on the stress recovery and drop before and after the arrival of BPR, respectively. Our work clarifies the nature and excitation of BPR, and can help improve the understanding of earthquake physics, the inference of fault property distribution and evolution, and the assessment of earthquake hazard.</description>

      <title>Modeling crack arrest in snow slab avalanches -- towards estimating avalanche release sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry-snow slab avalanches are considered to be the most difficult to predict, yet the deadliest avalanche types. The release of snow slab avalanches starts with a initial failure in a weak layer that may propagate across the slope until the slab fractures and slides. The evaluation of crack propagation area is a primary concern for avalanche forecasters. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the heterogeneity of snowpack properties is one of the primary factors that may potentially stop dynamic crack propagation. To test this assumption, we use a depth-averaged Material Point Method (DA-MPM) for efficient elasto-plastic modeling of snow slab avalanches. Our analysis includes scenarios involving i) pure-elastic slabs and ii) elasto-plastic slabs. In the first scenario, we report a significant decrease in slab tensile stress with increasing crack speed compared to quasi-static theory. In addition, we quantify the effect of weak layer heterogeneity and softening fracture energy on the crack stopping mechanism. In the second scenario, we analyse the interplay between weak layer heterogeneity and slab tensile fracture and quantify their combined effect on crack arrest. Results are interpreted through a scaling law relating the crack arrest distance to two dimensionless numbers related to weak layer strength variability and slab tensile fracture. Furthermore, the proposed model is applied to field campaigns in which spatial variations of weak layer shear strength were measured. Finally, DA-MPM simulations are performed on three-dimensional terrain with spatial variations revealing interesting release patterns. This research and the proposed methods can not only enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing avalanche release sizes,and possibly, the design of new mitigation measures for avalanche start zones.</description>

      <title>Impact disruption of Bjurb\"ole porous chondritic projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ~200 m/s impact of a single 400-kg Bjurb\"ole L/LL ordinary chondrite meteorite onto sea ice resulted in the catastrophic disruption of the projectile. This resulted in a significant fraction of decimeter-sized fragments that exhibit power law cumulative size and mass distributions. This size range is underrepresented in impact experiments and asteroid boulder studies. The Bjurb\"ole projectile fragments share similarities in shape (sphericity, and roughness at small and large scale) with asteroid boulders. However, the mean aspect ratio (3D measurement) and apparent aspect ratio (2D measurement) of Bjurb\"ole fragment is 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, indicating that Bjurb\"ole fragments are more equidimensional compared to both fragments produced in smaller scale impact experiments and asteroid boulders. These differences may be attributed either to the fragment source (projectile vs. target), to the high porosity and low strength of Bjurb\"ole, to the lower impact velocity compared with typical asteroid collision velocities, or potentially to fragment erosion during sea sediment penetration or cleaning.</description>

      <title>The role of coherent airflow structures on the incipient aeolian entrainment of coarse particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of coherent airflow structures capable of setting gravel-size particles in motion is studied theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, a micromechanical model based on energy conservation is proposed to describe the incipient motion of large particles ranging from rocking (incomplete entrainment) to incipient rolling (full entrainment). Wind tunnel experiments were conducted on an aerodynamically rough bed surface under near-threshold airflow conditions. Synchronous signals of airflow velocities upwind of the test particles and particle displacement are measured using a hot film anemometer and a laser distance sensor, respectively, from which coherent airflow structures (extracted via quadrant analysis) and particle movements are interlinked. It is suggested that the incipient motion of gravel-size particles (rocking and rolling) may result from sufficiently energetic sweep events corresponding to aerodynamic drag forces in excess of the local micro-topography resistance. However, full entrainment in rolling mode should satisfy the presented work-based criterion. Furthermore, using an appropriate probabilistic frame, the proposed criterion may be suitable for describing processes of energy transfer from the wind to the granular soil surface, ranging from the creep transport of gravels to the "mechanical sieving" of mega-ripples, as well as the transport of light anthropogenic debris (such as plastics).</description>

      <title>Extrapolability Improvement of Machine Learning-Based Evapotranspiration Models via Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based hydrological prediction models, despite their high accuracy, face limitations in extrapolation capabilities when applied globally due to uneven data distribution. This study integrates Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to improve the geographical adaptability of evapotranspiration (ET) models. By employing DANN, we aim to mitigate distributional discrepancies between different sites, significantly enhancing the model's extrapolation capabilities. Our results show that DANN improves ET prediction accuracy with an average increase in the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.2 to 0.3 compared to the traditional Leave-One-Out (LOO) method. DANN is particularly effective for isolated sites and transition zones between biomes, reducing data distribution discrepancies and avoiding low-accuracy predictions. By leveraging information from data-rich areas, DANN enhances the reliability of global-scale ET products, especially in ungauged regions. This study highlights the potential of domain adaptation techniques to improve the extrapolation and generalization capabilities of machine learning models in hydrological studies.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using dbscan, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate its efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as in-situ satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of the aurora. We discuss instances when this prediction is brought to fruition and when it ostensibly is not. Through case studies, we highlight the important instances when the radar echo bulk motions vary considerably around discrete auroral arcs, an effect we argue is produced by strong electric field modulations caused by energetic particle precipitation.</description>

      <title>The Directionality of Gravitational and Thermal Diffusive Transport in Geologic Fluid Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusive transport has implications for the long-term status of underground storage of hydrogen (H$_2$) fuel and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), technologies which are being pursued to mitigate climate change and advance the energy transition. Once injected underground, CO$_2$ and H$_2$ will exist in multiphase fluid-water-rock systems: being partially-soluble, injected fluids can flow through the porous rack in a connected plume, become disconnected and trapped as ganglia surrounded by groundwater within the storage rock pore space, and also dissolve and migrate through the aqueous phase. Recent analyses have focused on the concentration gradients induced by differing capillary pressure between fluid ganglia which can drive diffusive transport ("Ostwald ripening"). However, studies have neglected or excessively simplified important factors; namely: the non-ideality of gases under geologic conditions, the opposing equilibrium state of dissolved CO$_2$ and H$_2$ driven by the partial molar density of dissolved solutes, and entropic and thermodiffusive effects resulting from geothermal gradients. We conduct an analysis from thermodynamic first principles and use this to provide numerical estimates at conditions relevant to underground storage reservoirs. We show that entropic contributions to the free energy are so significant as to cause a reversal in the direction of diffusive transport in systems with geothermal gradients. For CO$_2$, even geothermal gradients less than 10 C/km induce downwards diffusion at depths relevant to storage. Diffusive transport of H$_2$ is less affected, but still reverses direction under typical gradients. Contrary to previous studies, we find that in diffusion and convection will likely work in concert - both driving CO$_2$ downwards, and both driving H$_2$ upwards - for conditions representative of their respective storage reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Gemini &amp; Physical World: Large Language Models Can Estimate the Intensity of Earthquake Shaking from Multi-Modal Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing. The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes. More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness. This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions. This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation.</description>

      <title>The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged for planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.</description>
