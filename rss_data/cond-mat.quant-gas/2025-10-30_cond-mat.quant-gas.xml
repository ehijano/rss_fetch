      <title>Observation of vector rogue waves in repulsive three-component atomic mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of vector extensions of Peregrine solitons in highly particle-imbalanced, pairwise immiscible three-component repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The possibility of an effectively attractive character of the minority components is established by constructing a generalized reduction scheme for an imbalanced N-component setup with arbitrary interaction signs. These components may suffer intra- and inter-component modulation instability, which along with the presence of an attractive potential well induces the dynamical formation of highly reproducible vector rogue waves. Exploiting different Rb hyperfine states, it is possible to flexibly tune the effective interactions stimulating the realization of a plethora of vector rogue waves, including single and double Peregrine-like wave peaks. The experimental findings are in quantitative agreement with suitable three-dimensional mean-field simulations, while quasi-one-dimensional analysis of the non-polynomial Schr\"odinger model provides additional insights into the rogue wave characteristics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dynamical Duality of Quantum Particles in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalized dynamical duality for identical particles in one dimension (1D). Namely, 1D systems with arbitrary statistics -- including bosons, fermions and anyons -- approach the same momentum distribution after long-time expansion from a trap, provided they share the same scattering length for short-range interactions. This momentum distribution is uniquely given by the rapidities, or quasi-momenta, of the initial trapped state. Our results can be readily detected in quasi-1D ultracold gases with tunable s- and p-wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Polar core vortex dynamics in disc-trapped homogeneous spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of polar core vortices in the easy plane phase of an atomic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a two-dimensional disc potential. A single vortex moves radially outward due to its interaction with background flows that arise from boundary effects. Pairs of opposite sign vortices, which tend to attract, move either radially inward or outward, depending on their strength of attraction relative to boundary effects. Pairs of same sign vortices repel. Spiral vortex dynamics are obtained for same-sign pairs in the presence of a finite axial magnetization. We quantify the dynamics for a range of realistic experimental parameters, finding that the vortex dynamics are accelerated with increasing quadratic Zeeman energy, consistent with existing studies in planar systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced correlation propagation in the one-dimensional SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of correlation propagation in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with SU($N$) symmetry when the replusive-interaction strength is quenched from a large value, at which the ground state is a Mott-insulator with $1/N$ filling, to an intermediate value. From approximate analytical insights based on a simple model that captures the essential physics of the doublon excitations, we show that entanglement in the initial state leads to collective enhancement of the propagation velocity $v_{\text{SU}(N)}$ when $N&gt;2$, becoming equal to the velocity of the Bose-Hubbard model in the large-$N$ limit. These results are supported by numerical calculations of the density-density correlation in the quench dynamics for $N=2,3,4,$ and $6$.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Spin Currents in a Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe and model spin currents arising from chirality and effective spin-exchange interactions in a weakly interacting $^6$Li Fermi gas. Chirality is introduced by a static displacement between the center of the trapped atoms and the center of an applied magnetic bowl, which produces spatially varying spin rotation. Spin-selective spin current is observed via oscillations in the centers of mass of the spin-up and spin-down components, which appear to bounce off of or pass through one another, depending on the relative size of the chirality and s-wave spin scattering interactions. We show that this behavior obeys a driven oscillator equation with an effective spin-dependent driving force.</description>

      <title>Universal Random Matrix Behavior of a Fermionic Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of universal governing principles is a foundational endeavor in physics, driving breakthroughs from thermodynamics to general relativity and quantum mechanics. In 1951, Wigner introduced the concept of a statistical description of energy levels of heavy atoms, which led to the rise of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in physics. The theory successfully captured spectral properties across a wide range of atomic systems, circumventing the complexities of quantum many-body interactions. Rooted in the fundamental principles of stochasticity and symmetry, RMT has since found applications and revealed universal laws in diverse physical contexts, from quantum field theory to disordered systems and wireless communications. A particularly compelling application arises in describing the mathematical structure of the many-body wavefunction of non-interacting Fermi gases, which underpins a complex spatial organization driven by Pauli's exclusion principle. However, experimental validation of the counting statistics predicted in such systems has remained elusive. Here, we probe at the single-atom level ultracold atomic Fermi gases made of two interacting spin states, obtaining direct access to their counting statistics in situ. Our measurements show that, while the system is strongly attractive, each spin-component is extremely well described by RMT predictions based on Fredholm determinants. Our results constitutes the first experimental validation of the Fermi-sphere point process through the lens of RMT, and establishes its relevance for strongly-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Encoding computationally hard problems in triangular Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays are a promising platform for quantum optimization, encoding computationally hard problems by reducing them to independent set problems with unit-disk graph topology. In Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023), a systematic and efficient strategy was introduced to encode multiple problems into a special unit-disk graph: the King's subgraph. However, King's subgraphs are not the optimal choice in two dimensions. Due to the power-law decay of Rydberg interaction strengths, the approximation to unit-disk graphs in real devices is poor, necessitating post-processing that lacks physical interpretability. In this work, we develop an encoding scheme that can universally encode computationally hard problems on triangular lattices, based on our innovative automated gadget search strategy. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum optimization on triangular lattices reduces independence-constraint violations by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to King's subgraphs, substantially alleviating the need for post-processing in experiments.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced Anderson transition in a kicked one dimensional Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to periodic kicks. In both the non-interacting and strongly interacting limits, the system undergoes dynamical localization, leading to energy saturation at long times. However, for finite interactions, we reveal an interaction-driven transition from an insulating to a metallic phase at a critical kicking strength, provided the number of particles is three or more. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution of the Lieb-Liniger gas, we establish a formal correspondence between its dynamical evolution and an Anderson model in $N$ spatial dimensions, where $N$ is the number of particles. This theoretical prediction is supported by extensive numerical simulations for three particles, complemented by finite-time scaling analysis, demonstrating that this transition belongs to the orthogonal Anderson universality class.</description>

      <title>Three-body Physics in the Impurity Limit of 39K Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, three-body loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for the extraction of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of a Bipartite Quench in a 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as `bipartite quench' protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons: A selfconsistent density-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</description>

      <title>An efficient high-current circuit for fast radio-frequency spectroscopy in cold atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement a low-impedance, high-current radio-frequency (RF) circuit, enabling fast coherent coupling between magnetic levels in cold alkali atomic samples. It is based on a compact shape-optimized coil that maximizes the RF field coupling with the atomic magnetic dipole, and on coaxial transmission-line transformers that step up the field-generating current flowing in the coil by a factor $\sim\,4$ to about $7.5\,$A for $100\,$W of RF driving. This allows to obtain a RF coupling field of about $0.035\,\text{G}/\sqrt{\text{W}}$ at the atomic sample location. The system is robust and versatile, as it generates a large RF field without compromising on the available optical access, and its central resonant frequency can be adjusted in situ. Our approach provides a cost-effective, reliable solution, featuring a negligible level of interference with surrounding electronic equipment thanks to its symmetric layout. We test the circuit performance using a maximum RF power of $80\,$W at a frequency around $82\,$MHz, which corresponds to a measured Rabi frequency $\Omega_R/2\pi \simeq 18.5\,$kHz, i.e. a $\pi$-pulse duration of about $27\,\mu$s, between two of the lowest states of ${}^6$Li at an offset magnetic field of $770\,$G. Our solution can be readily adapted to other atomic species and vacuum chamber designs, in view of an increasing modularity of cold atom experiments.</description>
