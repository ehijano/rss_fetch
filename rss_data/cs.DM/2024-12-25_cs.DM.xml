      <title>The EnvDesign Model: A Method to Solve the Environment Design Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, several people and organizations rely on cloud platforms. The reliability of cloud platforms depends heavily on the performance of their internal programs (agents). To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the "environment design" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains.</description>

      <title>Runs in Paperfolding Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paperfolding sequences form an uncountable class of infinite sequences over the alphabet $\{ -1, 1 \}$ that describe the sequence of folds arising from iterated folding of a piece of paper, followed by unfolding. In this note we observe that the sequence of run lengths in such a sequence, as well as the starting and ending positions of the $n$'th run, is $2$-synchronized and hence computable by a finite automaton. As a specific consequence, we obtain the recent results of Bunder, Bates, and Arnold, in much more generality, via a different approach. We also prove results about the critical exponent and subword complexity of these run-length sequences.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Dynamic Qubit Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard combinatorial optimization problems, often mapped to Ising models, promise potential solutions with quantum advantage but are constrained by limited qubit counts in near-term devices. We present an innovative quantum-inspired framework that dynamically compresses large Ising models to fit available quantum hardware of different sizes. Thus, we aim to bridge the gap between large-scale optimization and current hardware capabilities. Our method leverages a physics-inspired GNN architecture to capture complex interactions in Ising models and accurately predict alignments among neighboring spins (aka qubits) at ground states. By progressively merging such aligned spins, we can reduce the model size while preserving the underlying optimization structure. It also provides a natural trade-off between the solution quality and size reduction, meeting different hardware constraints of quantum computing devices. Extensive numerical studies on Ising instances of diverse topologies show that our method can reduce instance size at multiple levels with virtually no losses in solution quality on the latest D-wave quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>The basis number of 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a set of Eulerian subgraphs of a graph $G$. We say $B$ forms a $k$-basis if it is a minimum set that generates the cycle space of $G$, and any edge of $G$ lies in at most $k$ members of $B$. The basis number of a graph $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the smallest integer such that $G$ has a $k$-basis. A graph is called 1-planar (resp. planar) if it can be embedded in the plane with at most one crossing (resp. no crossing) per edge. MacLane's planarity criterion characterizes planar graphs based on their cycle space, stating that a graph is planar if and only if it has a $2$-basis. We study here the basis number of 1-planar graphs, demonstrate that it is unbounded in general, and show that it is bounded for many subclasses of 1-planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic.The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling.The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones.On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled.In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well.This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics.Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>Signed combinatorial interpretations in algebraic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of signed combinatorial interpretations for several large families of structure constants. These families include standard bases of symmetric and quasisymmetric polynomials, as well as various bases in Schubert theory. The results are stated in the language of computational complexity, while the proofs are based on the effective M\"obius inversion.</description>

      <title>On the number of $k$-mers admitting a given lexicographical minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimizer of a word of size $k$ (a $k$-mer) is defined as its smallest substring of size $m$ (with $m\leq k$), according to some ordering on $m$-mers. minimizers have been used in bioinformatics -- notably -- to partition sequencing datasets, binning together $k$-mers that share the same minimizer. It is folklore that using the lexicographical order lead to very unbalanced partitions, resulting in an abundant literature devoted to devising alternative orders for achieving better balanced partitions. To the best of our knowledge, the unbalanced-ness of lexicographical-based minimizer partitions has never been investigated from a theoretical point of view. In this article, we aim to fill this gap and determine, for a given minimizer, how many $k$-mers would admit the chosen minimizer -- i.e. what would be the size of the bucket associated to the chosen minimizer in the worst case, where all $k$-mers would be seen in the data. We show that this number can be computed in $O(km)$ space and $O(km^2)$ time. We further introduce approximations that can be computed in $O(k)$ space and $O(km)$ time. We also show on genomic datasets that the practical number of $k$-mers associated to a minimizer are closely correlated to the theoretical expected number. We introduce two conjectures that could help closely approximating the total number of $k$-mers sharing a minimizer. We believe that characterising the distribution of the number of $k$-mers per minimizer will help devise efficient lexicographic-based minimizer bucketting.</description>
