      <title>A Highly Clean Recipe Dataset with Ingredient States Annotation for State Probing Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs.</description>

      <title>QuMAB: Query-based Multi-annotator Behavior Pattern Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-annotator learning traditionally aggregates diverse annotations to approximate a single ground truth, treating disagreements as noise. However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMATL (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset.</description>

      <title>Principled Multimodal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>HLFormer: Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Hyperbolic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content. Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features. Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text &lt; video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at https://github.com/lijun2005/ICCV25-HLFormer.</description>

      <title>Fact-Checking with Contextual Narratives: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Social Media Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose CRAVE (Cluster-based Retrieval Augmented Verification with Explanation); a novel framework that integrates retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) with clustering techniques to address fact-checking challenges on social media. CRAVE automatically retrieves multimodal evidence from diverse, often contradictory, sources. Evidence is clustered into coherent narratives, and evaluated via an LLM-based judge to deliver fact-checking verdicts explained by evidence summaries. By synthesizing evidence from both text and image modalities and incorporating agent-based refinement, CRAVE ensures consistency and diversity in evidence representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate CRAVE's efficacy in retrieval precision, clustering quality, and judgment accuracy, showcasing its potential as a robust decision-support tool for fact-checkers.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</description>

      <title>Speech as a Multimodal Digital Phenotype for Multi-Task LLM-based Mental Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.</description>

      <title>Infinite Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</description>
