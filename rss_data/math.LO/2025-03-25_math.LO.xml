      <title>On finite cohesiveness principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the cohesiveness principle applied to finite sequences of sets, referred to as $\mathrm{fin}$-$\mathrm{COH}$. We investigate its strength over different base theories: We show that over $\mathrm{RCA}^*_0$, $\mathrm{fin}$-$\mathrm{COH}$ implies $\mathrm{I}\Sigma_1^0$, which answers a question by Fiori-Carones, Ko{\l}odziejczyk and Kowalik. We also show that $\mathrm{fin}$-$\mathrm{COH}$ is not provable over $\mathrm{WKL}_0$.</description>

      <title>Constructive Limits of Cantor's Diagonal Method: Countability, Enumerability, and the Impossibility of Exhausting the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cantor's diagonal method is traditionally used to prove the uncountability of the set of all infinite binary sequences. This paper analyzes the expressive limits of this method. It is shown that under any constructive application -- including generalizations with computable permutations and infinite hierarchies of diagonal extensions -- the resulting set remains countable. Thus, the method demonstrates the incompleteness of countable coverage but is unable to generate an uncountable set. This highlights its limitations as a constructive tool and reveals the boundary between constructive enumerability and the completeness of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantifier Elimination with a Focus on Matrix Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for a model theoretic structure $B$ to 'inherit' quantifier elimination from another structure $A$. This yields an alternative proof of one of the main result from \cite{kle}, namely quantifier elimination for certain matrix rings. The original proof uses model theory, and while it is very elegant and insightful, the proof we propose is much shorter and provides a constructive algorithm.</description>

      <title>Failure of Approachability at the Successor of the first Singular for any Cofinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve two long-standing open problems regarding the combinatorics of $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. We answer a question of Shelah by showing that it is consistent for any $n\geq 1$ that $\mathsf{GCH}$ holds and there is a stationary set of points of cofinality $\aleph_n$ which is not in the approachability ideal. As a corollary, we obtain a model where the notions of goodness and approachability are distinct for stationarily many points of cofinality $\aleph_1$, answering an open question of Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between productively Menger and productively Hurewicz spaces in models of $\mathfrak b=\mathfrak d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the interplay between productively Menger and productively Hurewicz subspaces of the Cantor space. In particular, we show that in the Laver model for the consistency of the Borel's conjecture these two notions coincide and characterize Hurewicz spaces. On the other hand, it is consistent with CH that there are productively Hurewicz subspaces of the Cantor space which are not productively Menger.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing small varieties of periodic l-pregroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an axiomatization for the variety generated by the $n$-periodic l-pregroup $\mathbf{F}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, as well as for all possible joins of such varieties; the finite joins form an ideal in the subvariety lattice of l-pregroups and we describe fully its lattice structure. On the way, we characterize all finitely subdirectly irreducible (FSI) algebras in the variety generated by $\mathbf{F}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ as the $n$-periodic l-pregroups that have a totally ordered group skeleton (and are not trivial). The finitely generated FSIs that are not l-groups are further characterized as lexicographic products of a (finitely generated) totally ordered abelian l-group and $\mathbf{F}_k(\mathbb{Z})$, where $k \mid n$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate big Ramsey degrees of finite substructures of the universal countable homogeneous meet-tree and its binary variant. We prove that structures containing antichains have infinite big Ramsey degrees, and the big Ramsey degree of a 2-element chain is at least 8 and 7 for the binary variant. We deduce that the generic C-relation does not have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the classification of real-analytic vector fields on the two-torus up to orbital topological equivalence does not admit a complete numerical invariant that is a Borel function. Moreover, smooth vector fields that are difficult to classify appear in generic smooth 7-parameter families. In dimension 2, this improves the recent result of Gorodetski and Foreman (arXiv:2206.09322) for non-classifiability of smooth diffeomorphisms up to continuous conjugacy.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by structural properties of differential field extensions, we introduce the notion of a theory $T$ being derivation-like with respect to another model complete theory $T_0$. We prove that when $T$ admits a model companion $T_+$, several model-theoretic properties transfer from $T_0$ to $T_+$. These properties include completeness, quantifier elimination, stability, simplicity, and NSOP$_1$. We also observe that, aside from the theory of differential fields, examples of derivation-like theories are plentiful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supervaluationist approach to fixed-point semantics is, arguably, the most celebrated and studied competitor to the Strong Kleene approach within Kripkean truth. In this paper, we show how to obtain a supervaluationist fixed-point theory of truth for intuitionistic logic. In particular, we show how to do supervaluations over Kripke structures for intuitionistic logic, and we obtain the corresponding theories of truth, both semantic and axiomatic. Furthermore, we show how the theory of truth changes when the Kripke structures over which the supervaluations are defined change. Finally, we advance a supervaluationist theory of truth that, unlike the classical case or any of the other intuitionistic, supervaluationist theories, is compositional in nature.</description>

      <title>On Vector Spaces with Formal Infinite Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss possible definitions of categories of vector spaces enriched with a notion of formal infinite linear combination in the likes of the formal infinite linear combinations one has in the context of generalized power series, I call these \emph{reasonable categories of strong vector spaces} (r.c.s.v.s.). I show that, in a precise sense, the more general possible definition for a strong vector space is that of a small $\mathrm{Vect}$-enriched endofunctor of $\mathrm{Vect}$ that is right orthogonal for every cardinal $\lambda$, to the cokernel of the canonical inclusion of the $\lambda$-th copower in the $\lambda$-th power of the identity functor: these form the objects for a universal r.c.s.v.s. I call $\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$. I show this is equivalent to the category of \emph{ultrafinite summability spaces} defined independently in arXiv:2403.05827. I relate this category to what could be understood to be the obvious category of strong vector spaces $B\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ and to the r.c.s.v.s. $K\mathrm{TVect}_s$ of separated linearly topologized spaces that are generated by linearly compact spaces. I analyze the monoidal closed structures on various r.s.v.s. induced by the natural one on $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$. In particular with respect to the problem of closure under the tensor product of $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$. Most of the technical results apply to a more general class of orthogonal subcategories of $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$ and we work with that generality as it's cost-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate variants of Marstrand's projection theorem that hold for sets of directions and classes of sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We say that a set of directions $D \subseteq\mathcal{S}^1$ is $\textit{universal}$ for a class of sets if, for every set $E$ in the class, there is a direction $e\in D$ such that the projection of $E$ in the direction $e$ has maximal Hausdorff dimension. We construct small universal sets for certain classes. Particular attention is paid to the role of regularity. We prove the existence of universal sets with arbitrarily small positive Hausdorff dimension for the class of weakly regular sets. We prove that there is a universal set of zero Hausdorff dimension for the class of AD-regular sets.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in ethically sensitive domains such as education, healthcare, and transportation, the need to balance accuracy and interpretability in decision-making has become a central concern. Coarse Ethics (CE) is a theoretical framework that justifies coarse-grained evaluations, such as letter grades or warning labels, as ethically appropriate under cognitive and contextual constraints. However, CE has lacked mathematical formalization. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST), a novel mathematical framework that models coarse-grained decision-making using totally ordered structures and coarse partitions. CST defines hierarchical relations among sets and uses information-theoretic tools, such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to quantify the trade-off between simplification and information loss. We demonstrate CST through applications in educational grading and explainable AI (XAI), showing how it enables more transparent and context-sensitive evaluations. By grounding coarse evaluations in set theory and probabilistic reasoning, CST contributes to the ethical design of interpretable AI systems. This work bridges formal methods and human-centered ethics, offering a principled approach to balancing comprehensibility, fairness, and informational integrity in AI-driven decisions.</description>
