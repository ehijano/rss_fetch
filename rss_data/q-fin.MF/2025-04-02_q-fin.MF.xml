      <title>Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure of the feedback controls. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the optimal policies, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their financial implications.</description>

      <title>Broker-Trader Partial Information Nash-Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study partial information Nash equilibrium between a broker and an informed trader. In this setting, the informed trader, who possesses knowledge of a trading signal, trades multiple assets with the broker in a dealer market. Simultaneously, the broker offloads these assets in a lit exchange where their actions impact the asset prices. The broker, however, only observes aggregate prices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both the broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected wealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, we establish that this equilibrium corresponds to the solution of a nonstandard system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) that involves the two differing filtrations. For short enough time horizons, we prove that a unique solution of this system exists. Finally, under quite general assumptions, we show that the solution to the FBSDE system admits a polynomial approximation in the strength of the transient impact to arbitrary order, and prove that the error is controlled.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage for Multi-option Portfolio Pricing and Valuation Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</description>
