      <title>FinSurvival: A Suite of Large Scale Survival Modeling Tasks from Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival modeling predicts the time until an event occurs and is widely used in risk analysis; for example, it's used in medicine to predict the survival of a patient based on censored data. There is a need for large-scale, realistic, and freely available datasets for benchmarking artificial intelligence (AI) survival models. In this paper, we derive a suite of 16 survival modeling tasks from publicly available transaction data generated by lending of cryptocurrencies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Each task was constructed using an automated pipeline based on choices of index and outcome events. For example, the model predicts the time from when a user borrows cryptocurrency coins (index event) until their first repayment (outcome event). We formulate a survival benchmark consisting of a suite of 16 survival-time prediction tasks (FinSurvival). We also automatically create 16 corresponding classification problems for each task by thresholding the survival time using the restricted mean survival time. With over 7.5 million records, FinSurvival provides a suite of realistic financial modeling tasks that will spur future AI survival modeling research. Our evaluation indicated that these are challenging tasks that are not well addressed by existing methods. FinSurvival enables the evaluation of AI survival models applicable to traditional finance, industry, medicine, and commerce, which is currently hindered by the lack of large public datasets. Our benchmark demonstrates how AI models could assess opportunities and risks in DeFi. In the future, the FinSurvival benchmark pipeline can be used to create new benchmarks by incorporating more DeFi transactions and protocols as the use of cryptocurrency grows.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Distribution of Empirical Correlation Matrices for Multiscale Complex Systems and Application to Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for describing eigenvalue distributions of correlation matrices from multidimensional time series. Using our newly developed matrix H theory, we improve the description of eigenvalue spectra for empirical correlation matrices in multivariate financial data by considering an informational cascade modeled as a hierarchical structure akin to the Kolmogorov statistical theory of turbulence. Our approach extends the Marchenko-Pastur distribution to account for distinct characteristic scales, capturing a larger fraction of data variance, and challenging the traditional view of noise-dressed financial markets. We conjecture that the effectiveness of our method stems from the increased complexity in financial markets, reflected by new characteristic scales and the growth of computational trading. These findings not only support the turbulent market hypothesis as a source of noise but also provide a practical framework for noise reduction in empirical correlation matrices, enhancing the inference of true market correlations between assets.</description>

      <title>Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging for uncertainty quantification of electricity price forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting models is essential to assess and mitigate the risks associated with data-driven decisions, especially in volatile domains such as electricity markets. Machine learning methods can provide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the decisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty estimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary risks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic forecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to improve forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an extensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show that iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in terms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction intervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to all benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In addition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile regression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable selection.</description>

      <title>Prediction of linear fractional stable motions using codifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) extends the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) by considering $\alpha$-stable increments. We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $\alpha&gt;1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $\alpha&lt;2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</description>
