      <title>Templating Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an aggregation process based on \emph{templating}, where a specified number of constituent clusters must assemble on a larger aggregate, which serves as a scaffold, for a reaction to occur. A simple example is a dimer scaffold, upon which two monomers meet and create another dimer, while dimers and larger aggregates undergo in irreversible aggregation with mass-independent rates. In the mean-field approximation, templating aggregation has unusual kinetics in which the cluster and monomer densities, $c(t)$ and $m(t)$ respectively, decay with time as $c\sim m^2\sim t^{-2/3}$. These starkly contrast to the corresponding behaviors in conventional aggregation, $c\sim \sqrt{m}\sim t^{-1}$. We then treat three natural extensions of templating: (a) the reaction in which $L$ monomers meet and react on an $L$-mer scaffold to create two $L$-mers, (b) multistage scaffold reactions, and (c) templated ligation, in which clusters of all masses serve as scaffolds and binary aggregation is absent.</description>

      <title>relentless: Transparent, reproducible molecular dynamics simulations for optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: relentless is an open-source Python package that enables the optimization of objective functions computed using molecular dynamics simulations. It has a high-level, extensible interface for model parametrization; setting up, running, and analyzing simulations natively in established software packages; and gradient-based optimization. We describe the design and implementation of relentless in the context of relative entropy minimization, and we demonstrate its abilities to design pairwise interactions between particles that form targeted structures. relentless aims to streamline the development of computational materials design methodologies and promote the transparency and reproducibility of complex workflows integrating molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Dissociation line and driving force for nucleation of the nitrogen hydrate from computer simulation. II. Effect of multiple occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation line of the nitrogen (N$_{2}$) hydrate by computer simulation using the TIP4P/Ice model for water and the TraPPE force field for N$_{2}$. This work is the natural extension of our previous paper in which the dissociation temperature of the N$_2$ hydrate has been obtained at $500$, $1000$, and $1500\,\text{bar}$ [\emph{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{159}, 224707 (2023)] using the solubility method and assuming single occupancy. We extend our previous study and determine the dissociation temperature of the N$_2$ hydrate at different pressures, from $500$ to $4500\,\text{bar}$, taking into account single and double occupancy of the N$_{2}$ molecules in the hydrate structure. We calculate the solubility of N$_2$ in the aqueous solution, as a function of temperature, when it is in contact with a N$_{2}$-rich liquid phase and when in contact with the hydrate phase with single and double occupancy via planar interfaces. Both curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature at a given pressure. We observe a negligible effect of the occupancy on the dissociation temperature. Our findings are in very good agreement with the experimental data taken from the literature. We have also obtained the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate as a function of the temperature and occupancy at several pressures. As in the case of the dissociation line, the effect of the occupancy on the driving force for nucleation is negligible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of the occupancy on the driving force for nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits sII crystallographic structure is studied from computer simulation.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of 3D printed micro-blades for cutting tissue-embedding material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting soft materials on the microscale has emerging applications in single-cell studies, tissue microdissection for organoid culture, drug screens, and other analyses. However, the cutting process is complex and remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, precise control over blade geometries, such as the blade tip radius, has been difficult to achieve. In this work, we use the Nanoscribe 3D printer to precisely fabricate micro-blades (i.e., blades &lt;1 mm in length) and blade grid geometries. This fabrication method enables a systematic study of the effect of blade geometry on the indentation cutting of paraffin wax, a common tissue-embedding material. First, we print straight micro-blades with tip radius ranging from ~100 nm to 10 um. The micro-blades are mounted in a custom nanoindentation setup to measure the cutting energy during indentation cutting of paraffin. Cutting energy, measured as the difference in dissipated energy between the first and second loading cycles, decreases as blade tip radius decreases, until ~357 nm when the cutting energy plateaus despite further decrease in tip radius. Second, we expand our method to blades printed in unconventional configurations, including parallel blade structures and blades arranged in a square grid. Under the conditions tested, the cutting energy scales approximately linearly with the total length of the blades comprising the blade structure. The experimental platform described can be extended to investigate other blade geometries and guide the design of microscale cutting of soft materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe, all-solid-state lithium metal batteries enable high energy density applications, but suffer from instabilities during operation that lead to rough interfaces between the metal and electrolyte and subsequently cause void formation and dendrite growth that degrades performance and safety. Inspired by the morphogenetic control of thin lamina such as tree leaves that robustly grow into flat shapes -- we propose a range of approaches to control lithium metal stripping and plating. To guide discovery of materials that will implement these feedback mechanisms, we develop a reduced order model that captures couplings between mechanics, interface growth, temperature, and electrochemical variables. We find that long-range feedback is required to achieve true interface stability, while approaches based on local feedback always eventually grow into rough interfaces. All together, our study provides the beginning of a practical framework for analyzing and designing stable electrochemical interfaces in terms of the mechanical properties and the physical chemistry that underlie their dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells. Our work suggests that interfaces of biomolecular condensates could mediate charge-specific transport similar to membrane-bound compartments.</description>

Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work. Although the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that Pi-release into the solution doesn't occur instantly upon the binding of a myosin to actin. Here, we examine how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction. Utilizing a cross-scale mechanics model for a sarcomere unit that integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction in silico. Our analysis leads us to propose that gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the bond strength of an attached myosin, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. When our model is applied to simulate muscle performance in response to rapid jumps in Pi concentrations, we observe asymmetric rates of force alteration, which corroborate previous experimental findings. Indeed, our model's predictions in the current work are largely consistent with experimental data. This research provides crucial insights into the kinetics of Pi-release within the myosin's chemomechanical cycle and its significant regulatory impact on muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>
