      <title>An extension of Priestley duality to fuzzy topologies and positive MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Priestley Duality to suitable categories of fuzzy topological spaces and ordered algebraic structures that generalize bounded distributive lattices. The duality we prove extends not only classical Priestley Duality between Priestley Spaces and bounded distributive lattices, but also the duality between limit cut complete MV-algebras and Stone MV-topological spaces (proved by the second author in a previous paper) which, on its turn, is an extension of classical Stone Duality.</description>

      <title>The category of propositional deductive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the category $\mathcal{QM}$ of quantales and their modules and prove the existence of coproducts, and the one of pushout and amalgamated coproducts under certain conditions. Then we define the non-full subcategory $\mathcal{DS}_0$, of propositional deductive systems, show that it is equivalent to the one of ``real'' propositional logics whose morphisms are interpretations (modulo a language translation, when needed), and prove that the coproduct in $\mathcal{DS}_0$ is precisely the deductive system called ``logical coproduct'' in [Russo,2022]. Last, we discuss amalgamation in $\mathcal{DS}_0$.</description>

      <title>Between Markov and restriction: Two more monads on categories for relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. A previous paper offered a survey providing a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'' as instances of gs-monoidal categories, showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The end result was a taxonomy that organised numerous related concepts in the literature, including in particular Markov and restriction categories. This paper further enriches the taxonomy: it proposes two categories that are once more instances of gs-monoidal categories, yet more abstract than Markov and restriction categories. They are characterised by an axiomatic notion of mass and domain of an arrow, the latter one of the key ingredient of restriction categories, which generalises the domain of partial functions. The paper then introduces mass and domain preserving monads, proving that the associated Kleisli categories in fact preserve the corresponding equations and that these monads arise naturally for the categories of semiring-weighted relations.</description>

      <title>Relative fixed points of functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the relatively initial or relatively terminal fixed points for a well-behaved functor $F$ form a pair of adjoint functors between $F$-coalgebras and $F$-algebras. We use the language of locally presentable categories to find sufficient conditions for existence of this adjunction. We show that relative fixed points may be characterized as (co)equalizers of the free (co)monad on $F$. In particular, when $F$ is a polynomial functor on $\mathsf{Set}$ the relative fixed points are a quotient or subset of the free term algebra or the cofree term coalgebra. We give examples of the relative fixed points for polynomial functors and an example which is the Sierpinski carpet. Lastly, we prove a general preservation result for relative fixed points.</description>

      <title>D-inverse constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebraic characterisation of ordered groupoids, namely, we show that there is a categorical isomophism between the category of ordered groupoids and the category of $D$-inverse constellations. Here constellations are partial algebras in the sense that they possess a partial product, and a unary operation $D$. We consider constellations in which elements have a suitable notion of inverse, giving the notion of a D-inverse constellation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part II: Non-Invertible Symmetries and the Symmetry TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07971v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of persistent homology has contributed new insights and perspectives into a variety of interesting problems in science and engineering. Work in this domain relies on the result that any finitely-indexed persistence module of finite-dimensional vector spaces admits an interval decomposition -- that is, a decomposition as a direct sum of simpler components called interval modules. This result fails if we replace vector spaces with modules over more general coefficient rings. To address this problem, we introduce an algorithm to determine whether or not a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) splits as a direct sum of interval submodules. If one exists, our algorithm outputs an interval decomposition. When considering persistence modules with coefficients in $\Z$ or $\Q[x]$, our algorithm computes an interval decomposition in polynomial time. This is the first algorithm with these properties of which we are aware. We also show that a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a PID splits as a direct sum of interval submodules if and only if the cokernel of every structure map is free. This result underpins the formulation of our algorithm. It also complements prior findings by Obayashi and Yoshiwaki regarding persistent homology, including a criterion for field independence and an algorithm to decompose persistence homology modules.</description>

      <title>A Sheaf-Theoretic Characterization of Tasks in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a sheaf-theoretic characterization of task solvability in general distributed computing models, unifying distinct approaches to message-passing models. We establish cellular sheaves as a natural mathematical framework for analyzing the global consistency requirements of local computations. Our main contribution is a task sheaf construction that explicitly relates both the distributed system and task, in which terminating solutions are precisely its global sections. We prove that a task can only be solved by a system when such sections exist in a task sheaf obtained from an execution cut, the frontier in which processes have enough information to decide. Our characterization is model-independent, working under varying synchronicity, failures and message adversaries, as long as the model produces runs composed of global states of the system. Furthermore, we show that the cohomology of the task sheaf provides a linear algebraic description of the decision space of the processes, and encodes the obstructions to find solutions. This opens way to a computational approach to protocol synthesis, which we illustrated by deriving a protocol for approximate agreement. This work bridges distributed computing and sheaf theory, providing both theoretical foundations for analyzing task solvability and tools for protocol design leveraging computational topology.</description>
