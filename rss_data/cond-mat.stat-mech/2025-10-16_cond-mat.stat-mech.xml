      <title>Comment on "Dissipation bounds the coherence of stochastic limit cycles"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has identified a fundamental bound on the thermodynamic cost of stochastic oscillators in the weak-noise regime (Santolin and Falasco, 2025; Nagayama and Ito, 2025). In this brief note, we provide an alternative and elementary derivation of this bound, based only on the assumption of Gaussian phase fluctuations and the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our approach may be useful for future generalizations of the bound.</description>

      <title>The Tracy-Widom distribution at large Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution $f_\beta(a)$ in the limit of large Dyson index $\beta \to +\infty$. This distribution describes the fluctuations of the rescaled largest eigenvalue $a_1$ of the Gaussian (alias Hermite) ensemble (G$\beta$E) of (infinitely) large random matrices. We show that, at large $\beta$, its probability density function takes the large deviation form $f_\beta(a) \sim e^{-\beta \Phi(a)}$. While the typical deviation of $a_1$ around its mean is Gaussian of variance $O(1/\beta)$, this large deviation form describes the probability of rare events with deviation $O(1)$, and governs the behavior of the higher cumulants. We obtain the rate function $\Phi(a)$ as a solution of a Painlev\'{e} II equation. We derive explicit formula for its large argument behavior, and for the lowest cumulants, up to order 4. We compute $\Phi(a)$ numerically for all $a$ and compare with exact numerical computations of the TW distribution at finite $\beta$. These results are obtained by applying saddle-point approximations to an associated problem of energy levels $E=-a$, for a random quantum Hamiltonian defined by the stochastic Airy operator (SAO). We employ two complementary approaches: (i) we use the optimal fluctuation method to find the most likely realization of the noise in the SAO, conditioned on its ground-state energy being $E$ (ii) we apply the weak-noise theory to the representation of the TW distribution in terms of a Ricatti diffusion process associated to the SAO. We extend our results to the full Airy point process $a_1&gt;a_2&gt;\dots$ which describes all edge eigenvalues of the G$\beta$E, and correspond to (minus) the higher energy levels of the SAO, obtaining large deviation forms for the marginal distribution of $a_i$, the joint distributions, and the gap distributions.</description>

      <title>Transport with noise in dilute gases: Effect of Langevin thermostat on transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dilute gases, transport properties such as the thermal conductivity, self-diffusion, and viscosity are significantly affected by interatomic collisions, which are determined by the potential form. This study explores these transport properties in the presence of a Langevin thermostat in systems where particles interact through various potentials, including soft-core and hard-core potentials, both with and without an attractive region. Using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on an analogy with an electric circuit (Ohm's law), we derived and compared the transport coefficients across these interatomic potentials for different couplings with the thermostat. The transport coefficients were obtained by considering the thermostat as a resistance in a series circuit.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs via Magic Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state $k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz (MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional Disorder and Logarithmic Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory. Motivated by the logarithmic behavior often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping logarithmic defects.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>$^{23}$Na-NMR study on the one-dimensional superoxide spin-chain compound NaO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report $^{23}$Na-NMR study on a candidate one-dimensional quantum spin system NaO$_2$. The Knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ were investigated down to 0.3 K under fields up to 16 T. The results reveal the opening of a spin gap of $\Delta(10.1 {\rm T}) \simeq$ 38 K below $T_{\rm S3} =$ 40 K, consistent with a spin-Peierls-like instability. The hyperfine coupling constant was found to drop sharply across the structural phase transition at $T_{\rm S2} =$ 215 K, highlighting the pronounced one-dimensional character of the system. These findings establish NaO$_2$ as a rare example of a $\pi$-orbital-based one-dimensional spin chain that exhibits a spin-gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Jump Processes with Self-Interactions: Large Deviation Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a pure jump process $\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ with values in a finite state space $S= \{1, \ldots, d\}$ for which the jump rates at time instant $t$ depend on the occupation measure $L_t \doteq t^{-1} \int_0^t \delta_{X_s}\,ds$. Such self-interacting chains arise in many contexts within statistical physics and applied probability. Under appropriate conditions, a large deviation principle is established for the pair $(L_t, R_t)$, as $t \to \infty$, where $R_t$ is the empirical flux process associated with the jump process. We show that the rate function takes a simple form that can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical Donsker and Varadhan rate function for the analogous quantities in the setting of Markov processes, in particular, unlike the Markovian case, the rate function is not convex. Since the state process is non-Markovian, different techniques are needed than in the setting of Donsker and Varadhan and our proofs rely on variational representations for functionals of Poisson random measures and stochastic control methods.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal buckling makes active filaments polyfunctional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active filaments are a workhorse for propulsion and actuation across biology, soft robotics and mechanical metamaterials. However, artificial active rods suffer from limited robustness and adaptivity because they rely on external control, or are tethered to a substrate. Here we bypass these constraints by demonstrating that non-reciprocal interactions lead to large-scale unidirectional dynamics in free-standing slender structures. By coupling the bending modes of a buckled beam anti-symmetrically, we transform the multistable dynamics of elastic snap-through into persistent cycles of shape change. In contrast to the critical point underpinning beam buckling, this transition to self-snapping is mediated by a critical exceptional point, at which bending modes simultaneously become unstable and degenerate. Upon environmental perturbation, our active filaments exploit self-snapping for a range of functionality including crawling, digging and walking. Our work advances critical exceptional physics as a guiding principle for programming instabilities into functional active materials.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning to Recognize Quantum Phases of Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed matter systems for realizing these models.
  In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <title>Compensation in trilayered anisotropic 6-state clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, when the total magnetisation vanishes keeping the nonzero sublattice magnetisations, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The larger systems show the growth of the height of the peak of the susceptibility near the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic constraints and pseudotransition behavior in a one-dimensional water-like system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional water-like lattice model with Van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions, allowing for particle number fluctuations through a chemical potential. The model, defined on a chain with periodic boundary conditions, exhibits three ground-state phases: gas, bonded liquid, and dense liquid, separated by sharp phase boundaries in the chemical potential and temperature plane. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive exact analytical results within the grand-canonical ensemble and examine the finite-temperature behavior. The system exhibits clear pseudotransition features, including sharp but analytic changes in entropy, density, and internal energy, along with finite peaks in specific heat and correlation length. To assess the role of thermodynamic constraints, we consider the behavior under fixed density through a Legendre transformation. This constrained analysis reveals smoother anomalies, such as entropy kinks and finite jumps in specific heat, contrasting with the sharper grand-canonical signatures. These results underscore the ensemble dependence of pseudotransitions and show how statistical constraints modulate critical-like behavior. We also verify that the residual entropy continuity criterion holds in the grand-canonical ensemble but is violated when the system is constrained. Our findings illustrate how even a simple one-dimensional model can mimic water-like thermodynamic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.</description>

      <title>Determining the optimal structural resolution of proteins through an information-theoretic analysis of their conformational ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08076v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of structural resolution is a fundamental aspect of protein modelling, determining the balance between descriptive power and interpretability. Although atomistic simulations provide maximal detail, much of this information is redundant to understand the relevant large-scale motions and conformational states. Here, we introduce an unsupervised, information-theoretic framework that determines the minimal number of atoms required to retain a maximally informative description of the configurational space sampled by a protein. This framework quantifies the informativeness of coarse-grained representations obtained by systematically decimating atomic degrees of freedom and evaluating the resulting clustering of sampled conformations. Application to molecular dynamics trajectories of dynamically diverse proteins shows that the optimal number of retained atoms scales linearly with system size, averaging about four heavy atoms per residue--remarkably consistent with the resolution of well-established coarse-grained models, such as MARTINI and SIRAH. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the optimal retained atoms number depends not only on molecular size but also on the extent of conformational exploration, decreasing for systems dominated by collective motions. The proposed method establishes a general criterion to identify the minimal structural detail that preserves the essential configurational information, thereby offering a new viewpoint on the structure-dynamics-function relationship in proteins and guiding the construction of parsimonious yet informative multiscale models.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Run-and-Tumble-Like Dynamics in a Robotic Analog of \textit{Chlamydomonas}: Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. One such example is a biflagellated alga, called \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. Its flagellar synchronization is not only affected by hydrodynamic interactions but also through contractile stress fibers that mechanically couple the flagella, enabling adaptable swimming behavior. To explore this, we design a macroscopic mechanical system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model this organism. By varying the attachment points of the two ends of the rod on each robot, the model incorporates the effect of fiber contractility observed in the real organism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp, direction-reversing tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with the real organism. Moreover, we quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics. Thus, our robotic system not only replicates RT motion but also captures several subtle characteristics, offering valuable insights into the underlying physics of microswimmer motility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.</description>

      <title>Local active error correction from simulated confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>
