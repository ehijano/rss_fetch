      <title>Investigation on different materials after pulsed high field conditioning and low-energy H- irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During operation, the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) of the LINAC4 at CERN is exposed to high electric fields, which can lead to vacuum breakdown. It is also subject to beam loss, which can cause surface modification, including blistering, which can result in reduced electric field holding and an increased breakdown rate. First, experiments to study the high-voltage conditioning process and electrical breakdown statistics have been conducted using pulsed high voltage DC systems in order to identify materials with high electric field handling capability and robustness to low-energy irradiation. In this paper, we discuss the results obtained for the different materials tested. To complement these, an investigation of their metallurgical properties using advanced microscopic techniques was done to observe and characterize the different materials and to compare results before and after irradiation and breakdown testing.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Characterization of REBCO-Coated Conductors at Cryogenic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle accelerators with superconducting magnets operating at cryogenic temperatures use a beam screen (BS) liner that extracts heat generated by the circulating bunched charge particle beam before it can reach the magnets. The BS surface, commonly made of high-conductivity copper, provides a low impedance for beam stability reasons, low secondary electron yield (SEY)to mitigate the electron-cloud (EC) effect, and low electron-stimulated desorption yield (ESD) to limit the dynamic pressure rise due to EC. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) high-temperature superconductors (HTs) recently reached technical maturity, are produced as coated conductor tapes (REBCO-CCs), and will be considered for application in future colliders to decrease the BS impedance and enable operation at around 50 K, consequently relaxing the cryogenic requirements. Aside from HTS properties, industry-grade REBCO-CCs also need qualification for EC and dynamic vacuum compatibility under accelerator-like conditions. Hence, we report the SEY and ESD measured at cryogenic temperatures of 12 K under low-energy electron irradiation of 0 - 1.4 keV. We also verify the sample compositions and morphologies using XPS, SEM, and EDS methods. The energy and dose dependencies of ESD are comparable to those of technical-grade metals and one sample reached SEY$_{MAX}=$1.2 after electron conditioning.</description>

      <title>SRF programs towards High-Q/High-G cavities in IJCLab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IJCLab has been leading the development and deployment of low-$\beta$ Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities for proton and heavy ion accelerators. We are launching an electron accelerator project for sustainable Energy Recovery Linac (iSAS/PERLE) with state-of-the-art SRF cavities at 800~MHz. Our proposal includes advanced heat treatment of such cavities to reach an excellent quality factor of $3\times 10^{10}$ at $22$~MV/m. In this paper, we overview the status of this activity.</description>

      <title>Dual-mode rf cavity: design, tuning and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a dual-mode radiofrequency (rf) cavity, a novel electromagnetic structure with potential benefits such as compactness, efficiency, cost reduction and multifunctionality. The cavity was designed to balance the dual-mode structure considering several factors, such as mode frequencies, quality factor (Q-factor), and minimizing cross talk between couplers. We preformed various tests to verify that this cavity preformed as expected compared to simulated results. As exampled here, a combination of the the fundamental mode TM 010 and the TM 011 mode, tuned to a harmonic of the fundamental, was realized to linearize the off-crest electric field, thereby enabling concurrent bunching and acceleration of charged particle (e.g. electrons) beam in high power systems. The reduction in the number of cavities required to bunch and accelerate promises cost and space savings over conventional approaches. This research lays the foundation for further exploration of multi-mode cavity applications and optimization for specific use cases, with potential implications for a wide range of fields including quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Time-Delayed Koopman Network-Based Model Predictive Control for the FRIB RFQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a critical device to accelerate heavy ion beams from 12 keV/u to 0.5 MeV/u for state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments. Efficient control of the RFQ resonance frequency detuning still remains a challenge because the temperature-sensitive frequency is solely control by a cooling water system, exhibiting complicated transport delay and nonlinearity in the heat transfer processes. In this work, we propose a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based Koopman network model that can simultaneously learn the time-delayed and non-delayed correlations hidden in the historical operating data. It is proven that the model can effectively predict the behavior of the RFQ resonance frequency using historical data as inputs. With this model, a model predictive control (MPC) framework based on the Newton-Raphson method is proposed and tested. We demonstrate that the MPC framework utilizing deep learning model is able to provide precise and rapid control for the RFQ frequency detuning, reducing the control time by half compared to the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.</description>
