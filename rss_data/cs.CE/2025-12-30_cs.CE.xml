      <title>Volume and Surface Area of two Orthogonal, Partially Intersecting Cylinders: A Generalization of the Steinmetz Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of two orthogonal cylinders represents a classical problem in computational geometry with direct applications to engineering design, manufacturing, and numerical simulation. While analytical solutions exist for the fully intersecting case, the Steinmetz solid, partial intersections with arbitrary depth ratios require numerical methods or approximations. This work presents general integral expressions for both the intersection volume and surface area as explicit functions of the intersection depth. Accompanying these exact formulations are empirical approximation functions, which provide closed-form evaluations with relative errors below 15% across the full range of intersection depth. Validation against Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation confirms the accuracy of both the analytical and approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>A Domain Decomposition-based Solver for Acoustic Wave propagation in Two-Dimensional Random Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An acoustic wave propagation problem with a log normal random field approximation for wave speed is solved using a sampling-free intrusive stochastic Galerkin approach. The stochastic partial differential equation with the inputs and outputs expanded using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is transformed into a set of deterministic PDEs and further to a system of linear equations. Domain decomposition (DD)-based solvers are utilized to handle the overwhelming computational cost for the resulting system with increasing mesh size, time step and number of random parameters. A conjugate gradient iterative solver with a two-level Neumann-Neumann preconditioner is applied here showing their efficient scalabilities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Stacking Optimization Using Dirichlet's Process (SoDip): Towards Accelerated Design for Graft Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents as VC investors: Predicting Startup Success via RolePlay-Based Collective Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Vocal Cord Ultrasound Examination: Project VIPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intro: Vocal cord ultrasound (VCUS) has emerged as a less invasive and better tolerated examination technique, but its accuracy is operator dependent. This research aims to apply a machine learning-assisted algorithm to automatically identify the vocal cords and distinguish normal vocal cord images from vocal cord paralysis (VCP). Methods: VCUS videos were acquired from 30 volunteers, which were split into still frames and cropped to a uniform size. Healthy and simulated VCP images were used as training data for vocal cord segmentation and VCP classification models. Results: The vocal cord segmentation model achieved a validation accuracy of 96%, while the best classification model (VIPRnet) achieved a validation accuracy of 99%. Conclusion: Machine learning-assisted analysis of VCUS shows great promise in improving diagnostic accuracy over operator-dependent human interpretation.</description>

      <title>Alpha-R1: Alpha Screening with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal decay and regime shifts pose recurring challenges for data-driven investment strategies in non-stationary markets. Conventional time-series and machine learning approaches, which rely primarily on historical correlations, often struggle to generalize when the economic environment changes. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities for processing unstructured information, their potential to support quantitative factor screening through explicit economic reasoning remains underexplored. Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. Alpha-R1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency. Empirical results across multiple asset pools show that Alpha-R1 consistently outperforms benchmark strategies and exhibits improved robustness to alpha decay. The full implementation and resources are available at https://github.com/FinStep-AI/Alpha-R1.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Off-Chain Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current DAO governance praxis limits organizational expressivity and reduces complex organizational decisions to token-weighted voting due to on-chain computational limits. This paper proposes verifiable off-chain computation (leveraging Verifiable Services, TEEs, and ZK proofs) as a framework to transcend these constraints while maintaining cryptoeconomic security. This paper explores three novel governance mechanisms: (1) attestation-based systems that compute multi-dimensional stakeholder legitimacy, (2) collective intelligence through verifiable preference processing, and (3) autonomous policy execution via Policy-as-Code. The framework provides architectural specifications, security models, and implementation considerations for DAOs seeking higher-resolution expressivity and increased operational efficiency, with validation from pioneering implementations demonstrating practical viability.</description>

      <title>GeoWarp: An automatically differentiable and GPU-accelerated implicit MPM framework for geomechanics based on NVIDIA Warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The material point method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian particle method, is increasingly used to simulate large-deformation and history-dependent behavior of geomaterials. While explicit time integration dominates current MPM implementations due to its algorithmic simplicity, such schemes are unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term processes typical in geomechanics. Implicit MPM formulations are free of these limitations but remain less adopted, largely due to the difficulty of computing the Jacobian matrix required for Newton-type solvers, especially when consistent tangent operators should be derived for complex constitutive models. In this paper, we introduce GeoWarp -- an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics built on NVIDIA Warp -- that exploits GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians without manual derivation. To enhance efficiency, we develop a sparse Jacobian construction algorithm that leverages the localized particle-grid interactions intrinsic to MPM. The framework is verified through forward and inverse examples in large-deformation elastoplasticity and coupled poromechanics. Results demonstrate that GeoWarp provides a robust, scalable, and extensible platform for differentiable implicit MPM simulation in computational geomechanics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</description>
