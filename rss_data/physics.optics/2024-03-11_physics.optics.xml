      <title>Interaction of light with subwavelength particles: Revealing the physics of electric dipole moment in the classical scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering problems are the classical tools for modeling of light-matter interaction. In this paper, we investigate the solution of dipole scattering problem under different incident radiation. In particular, we compare the two cases of incident plane and spherically incoming fields. With this comparison, we disclose the two distinct groups of current-sourced and current-free scattered fields which exhibit independent dynamics and dissimilar effects of the scatterer. We demonstrate how these fields by interfering each other make the resultant electric dipole moment of the scattered fields resonant and, thus, give rise to all the spectral features observed in the classical solution for dipole scattering of light.</description>

      <title>Amplification-free GW-level, 150 W, 14 MHz, and 8 fs, thin-disk laser oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an amplification-free thin-disk laser oscillatory system delivering 0.9 GW peak power. The 120 fs pulses at 14 MHz containing 12.8 $\mu$J delivered by thin-disk oscillator were compressed by factor 15 down to 8.0 fs with 148 W average output power and 82 % overall efficiency. Additionally, we showed that even a sub-two-cycle operation with 6.2 fs can be reached with this technology. The system will be a crucial part of the XUV frequency comb being developed and a unique high-repetition rate driver for attosecond pulse generation.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable inverse designed phase-change photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic network-on-chip (NoC) fabrics can provide multiple terabits per second (Tbps) bandwidth for high-performance computing servers supporting the latest artificial intelligence. To maximize the utility of the photonic hardware, these optical networks can multiplex data streams in multi-dimensional channels encoded in optical wavelengths, modes, and polarization states. A generic photonic platform that can be reconfigured to implement functionalities in those dimensions is highly desirable to streamline the design and manufacturing of integrated photonic networks. Here, we demonstrate a multi-functional photonic device using phase-change material Sb2Se3 that can be reconfigured from a wavelength-division demultiplexer to a mode-division demultiplexer. The reconfiguration is achieved by direct laser writing of phase patterns optimized with the inverse design technique. The demonstrated programmable phase-change photonic devices hold immense promise for a wide range of photonic applications requiring adaptable functionalities, including on-chip and in-package optical interconnects, optical signal processing, photonic tensor cores, and future optical computing for artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Simulation of diffraction and scattering using the Wigner Distribution Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray phase-contrast imaging enhances soft tissue visualization by leveraging the phase shift of X-rays passing through materials. It permits to minimize radiation exposure due to high contrast, as well as high resolution imaging limited by the wavelength of the X-rays. Phase retrieval extracts the phase shift computationally, but simulated images fail to recreate low-frequency noise observed in experimental images. To this end, we propose a new method to simulate phase contrast images using the Wigner Distribution Function. This permits the simulation of wave and particle effects simultaneously and simulates images photon by photon. Here, we give a first demonstration of the method by simulating the Gaussian double-slit experiment. It has the potential for realistic simulation of low-dose imaging.</description>

      <title>Emergent resonances in a thin film tailored by optically-induced small permittivity asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances are usually associated with finite systems - the vibrations of clamped strings in a guitar or the optical modes in a cavity defined by mirrors. In optics, resonances may be induced in infinite continuous media via periodic modulations of their optical properties. Here we demonstrate that periodic modulations of the permittivity of a featureless thin film can also act as a symmetry breaking mechanism, allowing the excitation of photonic $\textit{quasi}$-bound states in the continuum ($\textit{q}$BICs). By interfering two ultrashort laser pulses in the unbounded film, transient resonances can be tailored through different parameters of the pump beams. We show that the system offers resonances tunable in wavelength and quality-factor, and spectrally selective enhancement of third harmonic generation. Due to a fast decay of the permittivity asymmetry, we observe ultrafast dynamics, enabling time-selective near-field enhancement with picosecond precision. Optically-induced permittivity asymmetries may be exploited in on-demand weak to ultrastrong light-matter interaction regimes and light manipulation at dynamically chosen wavelengths in lithography-free metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>High-rectification near-field radiative thermal diode using Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal diodes, which allow heat transfer in a preferential direction while being blocked in a reverse direction, have numerous applications in thermal management, information processing, energy harvesting, etc. Typical materials of thermal diodes in previous works include phase-change and magneto-optical materials. However, such thermal diodes highly depend on specific working temperatures or external magnetic fields. In this work, we propose a near-field radiative thermal diode (NFRTD) based on two Weyl semimetals (WSMs) nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by WSMs planar substrate, which works without external magnetic field and with flexible temperatures. Numerical results show that the maximum rectification ratio of NFRTD can be up to 2673 when the emitter is 200 K and receiver is 180 K, which exceeds the maximum value reported in previous works by more than 10 times. The underlying physical mechanism is the strong coupling of the localized plasmon modes in the NPs and nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons in the substrate. In addition, we calculate the distribution of the Green function and reflection coefficient to investigate nonreciprocal energy transfer in NFRTD. Finally, we discuss the effects of momentum-separation on the rectification performance of the NFRTD. This work demonstrates the great potential of WSMs in thermal rectification and paves a novel path in designing high-performance NFRTD.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulation instability, breathers and solitons in ring-core optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate azimuthal modulation instability in an optical fiber supporting orbital angular momentum modes only, i.e. a vortex fiber, by means of the scalar multimode unidirectional pulse propagation equation. We demonstrate that the nonlinear stage of azimuthal modulation instability taking place in such a ring-core fiber, with anomalous rotation group-velocity dispersion, can be simply described by analytical breather solutions of the corresponding nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Azimuthal soliton dynamics and nonlinear compression are also unveiled as well as specific spatial rotating features as a function of the topological charge involved. Our results open a new route for studying transverse nonlinear waves in optical fibers and for manipulating orbital angular momentum states.</description>

      <title>Miniature narrow-linewidth 1 {\mu}m Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-injection locking scheme has the potential to narrow the linewidth of lasers in a compact setup. Here, we report a narrow linewidth laser source near 1 {\mu}m by self-injection locking scheme using a Fabry-Perot (FP) hollow resonator with a high-quality factor (Q&gt;10^8). The measured fundamental linewidth of the laser is 41 Hz, and a coarse tuning range over 5.5 nm is achieved by changing the driving current of the laser source. Meanwhile, a fine-tuning range of 373 MHz is achieved without mode hops by changing the voltage applied to the PZT on the resonator. More importantly, benefiting from the low thermal refractive noise and low thermal expansion of the FP hollow resonator, the beat-note linewidth and the frequency Allan deviation are measured to be 510.3 Hz in and 10^-11 (1s averaging time), respectively, by using a fully stabilized frequency comb as reference. Such a high-performance laser is fully integrated with a palm-sized package (52.3 mL) for field-deployable applications.</description>

      <title>Active Control of Bound States in the Continuum in Toroidal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable properties of toroidal metasurfaces, featuring ultrahigh-Q bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances and nonradiating anapole modes, have garnered significant attention. The active manipulation of toroidal resonance characteristics offers substantial potential for advancing tunable metasurfaces. Our study specifically explores the application of vanadium dioxide, a widely used phase change material in active photonics and room-temperature bolometric detectors, to control BIC resonances in toroidal metasurfaces. The phase change transition of vanadium dioxide occurs in a narrow temperature range providing a large variation in material resistivity. Through heating thin film patches of vanadium dioxide integrated into a metasurface comprising gold split-ring resonators on a sapphire substrate, we achieve remarkable control over the amplitude and frequency of toroidal dipole BIC resonances due to their high sensitivity to losses present in the system. Breaking the symmetry of meta-atoms reveals enhanced tunability. The predicted maximum change in the amplitude of toroidal dipole BIC resonances reaches 14 dB with a temperature variation of approximately 10oC. The proposed tunable metasurface holds promise for various applications, including active photonic systems and room temperature bolometers.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic polarization conversion and avoided-mode crossing in X-cut lithium niobate microrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with well-developed free space polarization converters, polarization conversion between TE and TM modes in waveguide is generally considered to be caused by shape birefringence, like curvature, morphology of waveguide cross section and scattering. Here, we reveal a hidden polarization conversion mechanism in X-cut lithium niobate microrings, that is the conversion can be implemented by birefringence of waveguides, which will also introduce an unavoidable avoided-mode crossing. In the experiment, we find that this mode crossing results in severe suppression of one sideband in local nondegenerate four-wave mixing and disrupts the cascaded four-wave mixing on this side. Simultaneously, we proposed, for the first time to our best knowledge, one two-dimensional method to simulate the eigenmodes (TE and TM) in X-cut microrings, which avoids the obstacle from large computational effort in three-dimensional anisotropic microrings simulation, and the mode crossing point. This work will provide an entirely novel approach to the design of polarization converters and simulation for monolithic photonics integrated circuits, and may be helpful to the studies of missed temporal dissipative soliton formation in X-cut lithium niobate rings.</description>

      <title>Wide-Field, High-Resolution Reconstruction in Computational Multi-Aperture Miniscope Using a Fourier Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional fluorescence microscopy is constrained by inherent trade-offs among resolution, field-of-view, and system complexity. To navigate these challenges, we introduce a simple and low-cost computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, utilizing a microlens array for single-shot wide-field, high-resolution imaging. Addressing the challenges posed by extensive view multiplexing and non-local, shift-variant aberrations in this device, we present SV-FourierNet, a novel multi-channel Fourier neural network. SV-FourierNet facilitates high-resolution image reconstruction across the entire imaging field through its learned global receptive field. We establish a close relationship between the physical spatially-varying point-spread functions and the network's learned effective receptive field. This ensures that SV-FourierNet has effectively encapsulated the spatially-varying aberrations in our system, and learned a physically meaningful function for image reconstruction. Training of SV-FourierNet is conducted entirely on a physics-based simulator. We showcase wide-field, high-resolution video reconstructions on colonies of freely moving C. elegans and imaging of a mouse brain section. Our computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, augmented with SV-FourierNet, represents a major advancement in computational microscopy and may find broad applications in biomedical research and other fields requiring compact microscopy solutions.</description>

      <title>Unified theory for frequency combs in ring and Fabry-Perot quantum cascade lasers: an order-parameter equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified model to describe the dynamics of optical frequency combs (OFCs) in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), incorporating both ring and Fabry-P\'erot (FP) cavity configurations. The model derives a modified complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), leveraging an order parameter approach and is capable of capturing the dynamics of both configurations, thus enabling a comparative analysis. In the modified CGLE, a nonlinear integral term appears which is associated with the coupling between counterpropagating fields in the FP cavity and whose suppression yields the ring model, which is known to be properly described by a conventional CGLE. We show that this crucial term holds a key role in inhibiting the formation of harmonic frequency combs (HFCs), associated to multi-peaked localized structures, due to its anti-patterning effect. We provide in support a comprehensive campaign of numerical simulations, in which we observe a higher occurrence of HFCs in the ring configuration compared to the FP case. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate the model's capability to reproduce experimental observations, including the coexistence of amplitude and frequency modulation, linear chirp, and typical dynamic scenarios observed in QCLs. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the single-mode solution for the ring case, confirming its consistency with numerical simulations and highlighting its predictive power regarding the formation of harmonic combs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast and highly collimated radially polarized photons from a colloidal quantum dot in a hybrid nanoantenna at room-temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To harness the potential of radially polarized single photons in applications such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD) accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization (&gt;93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured quantum light.</description>

      <title>Comparison between InAs-based and GaSb-based Interband cascade lasers with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare InAs-based and GaSb-based interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with the same 12 stages active region designed to emit at a wavelength of 4.6 {\mu}m. They employ a hybrid cladding architecture with the same geometry and inner claddings consisting of InAs/AlSb superlattices but different outer claddings: The InAs-based ICL employs plasmon enhanced n-type doped InAs layers while the GaSb-based ICL employs plasmon-enhanced n-type doped InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 claddings lattice matched to GaSb. Due to the lower refractive index of n+-InAsSb (n=2.88) compared to n+-InAs (n=3.10), the GaSb-based ICL shows a 3.8 % higher optical mode confinement in the active region compared to the InAs-based ICL. Experimentally, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 17.3 % lower threshold current density in pulsed operation at room temperature. Also presented is the influence of geometry and doping variation on confinement factors and calculated free carrier absorption losses in the GaSb-based ICL.</description>

      <title>Modified Coupled-mode Theory for the Absorption in Plasmonic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonance supported on plasmonic nanoparticle arrays enhances light-matter interactions for applications such as photoluminescence enhancement. The photoluminescence process is enhanced through confining light beyond the diffraction limit and inducing stronger light-matter interaction. In this work, the absorption mechanisms of plasmonic nanoparticle arrays embedded with photoluminescent absorbers are analyzed. A modified coupled-mode theory that describes the optical behavior of the surface lattice resonance was developed and verified by numerical simulations. Based on the analytical model, different components of the absorption contributed by the nanoparticles and the absorbers as well as the resonant properties of each of the components are identified. The origin of difference in resonant behavior with different materials is also discovered by exploring the nearfield characteristics of surface lattice resonance composed with a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband Optical Switching Plasmons Waveguide in Ge Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic devices, with their ultra-high integration density and data-carrying capacity comparable to optical devices, are currently a hot topic in the field of nanophotonic devices. Photodetectors, non-volatile memories, and ultra-compact lasers based on plasmons in low-dimensional materials are emerging at a rapid pace. However, the narrow optical response band and limited of convenient tunable methods currently available have hindered the development of these plasmonic materials. Here, we report a ultrabroadband non-equilibrium plasmonic responses based on Ge nanowires tuned by optical method. We tracked the blue shift of the plasmonic response of Ge nanowires due to photo-induced carriers over an ultra-broad spectral range of 800-2000 $cm^{-1}$. For the first time, we have achieved the imaging of propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in semiconductor nanowires, which were tuned by photo-induced carriers. The ultrafast and ultrabroadband response of semiconductor nanowire plasmons is of great significance for future ultrafast all-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous probes for BCDI: Toward the imaging of dynamic and distorted crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an innovative approach to improve Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) microscopy applied to time evolving crystals and/or non-homogeneous crystalline strain fields, identified as two major limitations of BCDI microscopy. Speckle BCDI (spBCDI), introduced here, rests on the ability of a strongly non-uniform illumination to induce a convolution of the three-dimensional (3D) frequency content associated with the finite-size crystal and a kernel acting perpendicularly to the illumination beam. In the framework of Bragg diffraction geometry, this convolution is beneficial as it encodes some 3D information about the sample in a single two-dimensional (2D) measurement, i.e., in the detector plane. With this approach, we demonstrate that we can drastically reduce the sampling frequency along the rocking curve direction and still obtain data sets with enough information to be inverted by a traditional phase retrieval algorithm.
  Numerical simulations, performed for a highly distorted crystal, show that spBCDI allows a gain in the sampling ratio ranging between 4 and 20 along the rocking curve scan, for a speckle illumination with individual speckle size of 50 nm. Furthermore, spBCDI allows working at low intensity levels, leading to an additional gain for the total scanning time. Reductions of a factor of about 32 were numerically observed. Thus, measurements in the 0.3 s time scale at 4th generation synchrotrons become feasible, with a remarkable performance for the imaging of strongly distorted crystals. Practical details on the implementation of the method are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Breaking Abbe's diffraction limit with harmonic deactivation microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical microscopy provides elegant means for label-free imaging of biological samples and condensed matter systems. The widespread areas of application could even be increased if resolution was improved, which is currently limited by the famous Abbe diffraction limit. Super-resolution techniques can break the diffraction limit but rely on fluorescent labeling. This makes them incompatible with (sub-)femtosecond temporal resolution and applications that demand the absence of labeling. Here, we introduce harmonic deactivation microscopy (HADES) for breaking the diffraction limit in non-fluorescent samples. By controlling the harmonic generation process on the quantum level with a second donut-shaped pulse, we confine the third harmonic generation to three times below the original focus size and use this pulse for scanning microscopy. We demonstrate that resolution improvement by deactivation is more efficient for higher harmonic orders, and only limited by the maximum applicable deactivation-pulse fluence. This provides a route towards sub-100~nm resolution in a regular nonlinear microscope. The new capability of label-free super-resolution can find immediate applications in condensed matter physics, semiconductor metrology, and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>

      <title>Effective multiband synthetic four-wave mixing by cascading quadratic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four wave mixing (FWM) is an important way to generate supercontinuum and frequency combs in the mid-infrared band. Here, we obtain simultaneous synthetic FWM in the visible and mid-infrared bands by cascading quadratic nonlinear processes in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal (PPLN), which has a 110dB(at 3000nm) higher conversion efficiency than the FWM directly generated by third-order susceptibilities in bulk PPLN crystals. A general model of this process is developed that is in full agreement with the experimental verifications. The frequency difference between the new frequency components can be freely tuned by changing the frequency difference of the dual pump lasers. Furthermore, by increasing the conversion bandwidth and efficiency of the cascaded processes, it is feasible to generate frequency combs in three bands the visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared bands simultaneously through high-order cascaded processes. This work opens up a new avenue toward free-tuning multiband frequency comb generation with multi-octaves frequency spanning, which will have significant applications in fields such as mid-infrared gas sensing, lidar and precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Surface lattice resonance lasers with epitaxial InP gain medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonance (SLR) lasers, where gain is supplied by a thin film active material and the feedback comes from multiple scattering by plasmonic nanoparticles, have shown both low threshold lasing and tunability of the angular and spectral emission. However, typically used materials such as organic dyes and QD films suffer from photo-degradation which hampers practical applications. Here, we demonstrate photo-stable single-mode lasing of SLR modes sustained in an epitaxial solid-state InP slab waveguide. The nanoparticle array is weakly coupled to the optical modes, which decreases the scattering losses and hence the experimental lasing threshold is as low as 90 $\mu$J/cm$^{2}$. The nanoparticle periodicity defines the lasing wavelength and enables tuneable emission wavelengths over a 70 nm spectral range. Combining plasmonic nanoparticles with an epitaxial solid-state gain medium paves the way for large-area on-chip integrated SLR lasers for applications including optical communication, optical computing, sensing, and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Shaping of Quantum Light Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method for the deterministic shaping of quantum light via photon number state selective interactions. Nonclassical states of light are an essential resource for high precision optical techniques that rely on photon correlations and noise reshaping. Notable techniques include quantum enhanced interferometry, ghost imaging, and generating fault tolerant codes for continuous variable optical quantum computing. We show that a class of nonlinear-optical resonators can transform many-photon wavefunctions to produce structured states of light with nonclassical noise statistics. The devices, based on parametric down conversion, utilize the Kerr effect to tune photon number dependent frequency matching, inducing photon number selective interactions. With a high amplitude coherent pump, the number selective interaction shapes the noise of a two-mode squeezed cavity state with minimal dephasing, illustrated with simulations. We specify the requisite material properties to build the device and highlight the remaining material degrees of freedom which offer flexible material design.</description>

      <title>Room temperature single-photon terahertz detection with thermal Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon terahertz (THz) detection is one of the most demanding technology for a variety of fields and could lead to many breakthroughs. Although its significant progress has been made in the last two decades, operating it at room temperature still remains a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the room temperature THz detector at single-photon levels based on nonlinear wave mixing in thermal Rydberg atomic vapor. The low-energy THz photons are coherently upconverted to the high-energy optical photons via a nondegenerate Rydberg state involved six-wave-mixing process, and therefore, the single-photon THz detection is achieved by a conventional optical single-photon counting module. The noise equivalent power of such a detector is reached to be 9.5*10^-19 W/Hz^1/2, which is more than four orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art room temperature THz detectors. The optimum quantum efficiency of the whole wave-mixing process is about 4.3% with 40.6 dB dynamic range, and the maximum conversion bandwidth is 172 MHz, which is all-optically controllable. The developed fast and continuous-wave single-photon THz detector at room temperature operation has a great potential to be portable and chip-scale, and could be revolutionary for a wide range of applications in remote sensing, wireless communication, biomedical diagnostics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaTiS3, a quasi-1D complex chalcogenide, has gathered considerable scientific and technological interest due to its giant optical anisotropy and electronic phase transitions. However, the synthesis of high-quality BaTiS3 crystals, particularly those featuring crystal sizes of millimeters or larger, remains a challenge. Here, we investigate the growth of BaTiS3 crystals utilizing a molten salt flux of either potassium iodide, or a mixture of barium chloride and barium iodide. The crystals obtained through this method exhibit a substantial increase in volume compared to those synthesized via the chemical vapor transport method, while preserving their intrinsic optical and electronic properties. Our flux growth method provides a promising route towards the production of high-quality, large-scale single crystals of BaTiS3, which will greatly facilitate advanced characterizations of BaTiS3 and its practical applications that require large crystal dimensions. Additionally, our approach offers an alternative synthetic route for other emerging complex chalcogenides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the occurrence of random electromagnetic field fluctuations, or virtual photons, in vacuum. The exchange of virtual photons between two bodies in relative motion could lead to non-contact quantum vacuum friction or Casimir friction. Despite its theoretical significance, the non-contact Casimir frictional force has not been observed and its theoretical predictions have varied widely. In this work, we report the first measurement of the non-contact Casimir frictional force between two moving bodies. By employing two mechanical oscillators with resonant frequencies far lower than those in Lorentz models of electrons in dielectric materials, we have amplified the Casimir frictional force at low relative velocities by several orders of magnitude. We directly measure the non-contact Casimir frictional force between the two oscillators and show its linear dependence on velocity, proving the dissipative nature of Casimir friction. This advancement marks a pivotal contribution to the field of dissipative quantum electrodynamics and enhances our understanding of friction at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>The Defects Genome of 2D Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from their unique two-faced structure, broken-mirror symmetry, and consequent colossal polarisation field within the monolayer. While efforts have been made to achieve high-quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain-boundary and point defects with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic properties Through High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point defects are single (Vs and Vse) and double chalcogen vacancy (Vs-Vse), interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic studies on h-BN-encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality and device properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of identical atoms exhibit peculiar collective properties in their interaction with radiation depending on geometry and environment where they are embedded in. A remarkably clean and versatile platform to study collective effects in resonant light scattering are M\"ossbauer nuclei placed in planar x-ray waveguides. Here we conceive and demonstrate experimentally distinct temporal emission characteristics in these systems, ranging from a tunable accelerated exponential decay all the way to a pronounced oscillatory emission pattern, depending on the waveguide geometry and mode of excitation. The observed temporal and spatial emission characteristics of the collectively excited nuclear state in the waveguide -- the nuclear exciton -- are well reproduced by a unified theoretical model. Our findings pave the way for applications ranging from fundamental studies of cooperative emission at hard x-ray frequencies up to new methods of narrowband x-ray control via the engineering of collective radiation patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete measurement of the quantum state of two correlated photons requires reconstructing the amplitude and phase of the biphoton wavefunction. We show how, by means of spatially resolved single photon detection, one can infer the spatial structure of bi-photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion. In particular, a spatially resolved analysis of the second-order correlations allows us to isolate the moduli of the pump and phasematching contributions to the two-photon states. When carrying this analysis on different propagation planes, the free space propagation of pump and phasematching is observed. This result allows, in principle, to gain enough information to reconstruct also the phase of pump and phasematching, and thus the full biphoton wavefunction. We show this in different examples where the pump is shaped as a superposition of orbital angular momentum modes or as a smooth amplitude with a phase structure with no singularities. The corresponding phase structure is retrieved employing maximum likelihood or genetic algorithms. These findings have potential applications in fast, efficient quantum state characterisation that does not require any control over the source.</description>

Abstract: The explorations of physical degrees of freedom with infinite dimensionalities, such as orbital angular momentum and frequency of light, have profoundly reshaped the landscape of modern optics with representative photonic functional devices including optical vortex emitters and frequency combs. In nanophotonics, whispering gallery mode microresonators naturally support orbital angular momentum of light and have been demonstrated as on-chip emitters of monochromatic optical vortices. On the other hand, whispering gallery mode microresonators serve as a highly efficient nonlinear optical platform for producing light at different frequencies - i.e., microcombs. Here, we interlace the optical vortices and microcombs by demonstrating an optical vortex comb on an III-V integrated nonlinear microresonator. The angular-grating-dressed nonlinear microring simultaneously emits spatiotemporal light springs consisting of 50 orbital angular momentum modes that are each spectrally addressed to the frequency components (longitudinal whispering gallery modes) of the generated microcomb. We further experimentally generate optical pulses with time-varying orbital angular momenta by carefully introducing a specific intermodal phase relation to spatiotemporal light springs. This work may immediately boost the development of integrated nonlinear/quantum photonics for exploring fundamental optical physics and advancing photonic quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: The knowledge of the exact structure of the optical system PSF enables a high-quality image reconstruction in fluorescence microscopy. Accurate PSF models account for the vector nature of light and the phase and amplitude modifications. Most existing real-space-based PSF models fall into a sampling pitfall near the centre position, yielding to the violation of the energy conservation. In this work, we present novel, to the best of our knowledge, Fourier-based techniques for computing vector PSF and compare them to the state-of-the-art. Our methods are shown to satisfy the physical condition of the imaging process. They are reproducible, computationally efficient, and easy to implement and easy to modify to represent various imaging modalities.</description>

Abstract: We consider in this paper the angular deviation and diffraction efficiency of the reflection gratings in Littrow-configuration for applications of external cavity diode laser using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. We consider the three-dimensional diffraction case in general, where the incidence plane is un-parallel with the grating vector, i.e. conical diffraction. The angular tolerance of arbitrary gratings under plane and conical diffraction are thus derived and presented. A typical blazed grating is chosen as an example to calculate its diffraction efficiency using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. Furthermore, we point out that the angular tolerance and reflection efficiency can be improved if the appropriate parameter settings are selected for Littrow-configuration devices, including incidence angle, diffraction order, grating period and blazed angle. Otherwise, a tiny slanting angle of the grating vector deviated from the incidence plane will deviate the feedback light away from entering the laser-diode-chip and halt laser oscillation in the external cavity. Finally, a general rule for the parameter settings in Littrow-configuration is provided as a benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries essentially provide conservation rules in nonlinear light-matter interactions, that facilitate control and understanding of photon conversion processes or electron dynamics. Since anisotropic solids have rich symmetries, they are strong candidate to control both optical micro- and macroscale structures, namely spin (circular polarization) and orbital angular momentum (spiral wavefront), respectively. Here, we show structured high harmonic generation linked to the anisotropic symmetry of a solid. By strategically preserving a dynamical symmetry arising from the spin-orbit interaction of light, we generate multiple orbital angular momentum states in high-order harmonics. The experimental results exhibit the total angular momentum conservation rule of light even in the extreme nonlinear region, which is evidence that the mechanism originates from a dynamical symmetry. Our study provides a deeper understanding of multiscale nonlinear optical phenomena and a general guideline for using electronic structure to control structured light, such as through Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Nearly perfect routing of chiral light by plasmonic grating on slab waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grating couplers are widely used to couple waveguide modes with the far field. Their usefulness is determined not only by energy efficiency but also by additional supported functionality. In this paper, we demonstrate a plasmonic grating on a silicon nitride slab waveguide that couples both TE and TM waveguide modes with circularly polarized light in the far field. Specifically, we experimentally confirmed that circularly polarized light excites TE and TM modes propagating in opposite directions, and the direction is controlled by the handedness. The routing efficiency for normally incident light reaches up to 95%. The same structure operates in the outcoupling regime as well, demonstrating up to 97% degree of circular polarization, where the handedness is determined by the polarization and propagation direction of outcoupled modes. Our results pave the way for the realization of polarization-division multiplexers and demultiplexers, integrated circular polarization emitters, as well as detectors of the polarization state of the incident optical field.</description>

      <title>Optical wood with switchable solar transmittance for all-round thermal management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technologies enabling passive daytime radiative cooling and daylight harvesting are highly relevant for energy-efficient buildings. Despite recent progress demonstrated with passively cooling polymer coatings, however, it remains challenging to combine also a passive heat gain mechanism into a single substrate for all-round thermal management. Herein, we developed an optical wood (OW) with switchable transmittance of solar irradiation enabled by the hierarchically porous structure, ultralow absorption in solar spectrum and high infrared absorption of cellulose nanofibers. After delignification, the OW shows a high solar reflectance (94.9%) in the visible and high broadband emissivity (0.93) in the infrared region (2.5-25 $\mu$m). Owing to the exceptional mass transport of its aligned cellulose nanofibers, OW can quickly switch to a new highly transparent state following phenylethanol impregnation. The solar transmittance of optical wood (OW-II state) can reach 68.4% from 250 to 2500 nm. The switchable OW exhibits efficient radiative cooling to 4.5 {\deg}C below ambient temperature in summer (81.4 W m$^{-2}$ cooling power), and daylight heating to 5.6 {\deg}C above the temperature of natural wood in winter (heating power 229.5 W m$^{-2}$), suggesting its promising role as a low-cost and sustainable solution to all-season thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic Phased Array XY Hamiltonian Solver</title>

Abstract: Solving large-scale computationally hard optimization problems using existing computers has hit a bottleneck. A promising alternative approach uses physics-based phenomena to naturally solve optimization problems wherein the physical phenomena evolves to its minimum energy. In this regard, photonics devices have shown promise as alternative optimization architectures, benefiting from high-speed, high-bandwidth and parallelism in the optical domain. Among photonic devices, programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have shown promise in solving large scale Ising model problems to which many computationally hard problems can be mapped. Despite much progress, existing SLMs for solving the Ising model and similar problems suffer from slow update rates and physical bulkiness. Here, we show that using a compact silicon photonic integrated circuit optical phased array (PIC-OPA) we can simulate an XY Hamiltonian, a generalized form of Ising Hamiltonian, where spins can vary continuously. In this nanophotonic XY Hamiltonian solver, the spins are implemented using analog phase shifters in the optical phased array. The far field intensity pattern of the PIC-OPA represents an all-to-all coupled XY Hamiltonian energy and can be optimized with the tunable phase-shifters allowing us to solve an all-to-all coupled XY model. Our results show the utility of PIC-OPAs as compact, low power, and high-speed solvers for nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problems. The scalability of the silicon PIC-OPA and its compatibility with monolithic integration with CMOS electronics further promises the realization of a powerful hybrid photonic/electronic non-Von Neumann compute engine.</description>

Abstract: Stability domains (i.e. pump frequency detuning range) of a single dark soliton (or platicon) and dark breather in high-Q Kerr optical microresonators with normal group velocity dispersion is studied for a wide range of pump amplitudes within the framework of the Lugiato-Lefever model. The effect of the significant fragmentation of the stability domains at high pump intensities is revealed. The existence of stable drifting dark solitons (platicons) is demonstrated above the threshold pump amplitude value. Properties of drifting solitons are investigated.</description>

Abstract: We present a table-top setup for femtosecond x-ray absorption spectroscopy based on high harmonic generation (HHG) in noble gases. Using sub-millijoule pump pulses at a central wavelength of 1550 nm broadband HHG in the range 70 to 350 eV was demonstrated. The HHG coherence lengths of several millimeters were achieved by reaching the nonadiabatic regime of harmonic generation. NEXAFS experiments on the boron K edge of a boron foil and a hexagonal BN (hBN) 2D material demonstrate the capabilities of the setup.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of polarization conversion based on borophene nanostructures in optical communication bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized light has various potential applications in the communication bands, including optical communication, polarization imaging, quantum emission, and quantum communication. However, optimizing polarization control requires continuous improvements in areas such as dynamic tunability, materials, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a borophene-based structure capable of converting linearly polarized light into arbitrarily polarized light through the coherent excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in optical communication band. Furthermore, a double-layer borophene structure can be achieved by placing a second borophene array at the top of the first one with a 90{\deg} relative rotation of their crystalline plane. The rotation direction of the polarization state of the reflected light can be switched by independently controlling the carrier concentration of the two-layer borophene. Finally, a dipole source is used to realize the emission of polarized light, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the emission rate in free space, and the polarization state can be dynamically controlled by manipulating the carrier concentration. Our study is simple and compact, with potential applications in the fields of polarizers, polarization detectors, and quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the "energy center" and "probability center" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS): A Comprehensive Approach to Label-free Absorption Microscopy Across Biological Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques have evolved as effective tools for non-invasive chemical specific structural, and functional imaging. Yet most modern label-free microscopy modalities target only a fraction of the contrast afforded by an optical absorption interaction. We introduce a comprehensive optical absorption microscopy technique, Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), which simultaneously captures the dominant light matter interactions which occur as a pulse of light is absorbed by a molecule. In PARS, the optical scattering, attenuation, and the transient radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes are collected at each optical absorption event. This provides a complete representation of the absorption event, providing unique contrast presented here as the total absorption (TA) and quantum efficiency ratio (QER) measurements. By capturing a complete view of each absorption interaction, PARS bridges many of the specificity challenges associated with label-free imaging, facilitating recovery of a wider range of biomolecules than independent radiative or non-radiative modalities. To show the versatility of PARS, we explore imaging across a wide range of biological specimens, from single cells to in-vivo imaging of living subjects. These examples of label-free histopathological imaging, and vascular imaging illustrate some of the numerous fields where PARS may have profound impacts. Overall PARS may provide comprehensive label-free contrast in a wide variety of biological specimens, providing otherwise inaccessible visualizations, and representing a new a source of rich data to develop new AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.</description>

Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) has become a multipurpose source of coherent XUV radiation used in various applications. One of the notable aspects of HHG is its wide spectrum consisting of many harmonic orders. This might represent a bottleneck in HHG utility for applications requiring a single wavelength. We propose a method to generate radiation consisting of a single high-order harmonic frequency employing Bessel-Gauss driving beam and a periodically modulated gaseous medium. We validate it by analytical calculations and numerical simulations. Our method provides a way to generate monochromatic harmonic radiation directly from the source without the need for additional monochromatizing optics. Thus, it represents a substantial enhancement of the flux and simplification of the setup for numerous applications requiring monochromatic short-wavelength radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an ultrahigh-efficiency, broadband and multi-channel all-optical switching scheme based on broadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in a linear and nonlinear regimes in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system. Two separate atomic transitions are excited simultaneously by two signal fields coupled from two ends of an optical cavity under the collective strong coupling condition. Three polariton eigenstates are produced which can be tuned freely by varying system parameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels are zero when the CPA criterion is satisfied. However, destructive quantum interference can be induced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the multi-polariton excitation. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a coherent perfect light absorber/transmitter as the control field is turned on/off the polariton resonances. In particular, the proposed scheme may be used to realize broadband multi-throw all-optical switching in the nonlinear excitation regime. The proposed scheme is useful for constructing all-optical routing, all-optical communication networks and various quantum logic elements.</description>

Abstract: A tunable optical multistability scheme based on a single cavity mode coupled with two separate atomic transitions in an atom-cavity system is proposed and demonstrated. Under the collective strong coupling condition, multiple polariton eigenstates of the atom-cavity system are produced. The threshold and optical multistability curve can be tuned freely by system parameters in a broadband range. Moreover, a certain bistability region of the system is split to two bistability regions due to destructive quantum interference induced by an extra weak control field. Compared to traditional optical multistabilities created by two or more light fields, the proposed optical multistability scheme has compactness and is easy to be miniaturized. The proposed scheme is useful for manufacturing integrated application of multi-state all-optical logic devices and constructing basic elements of all-optical communication networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Environmental Stability of Perovskite Thin Films via PMMA and AZ5214-Photoresist Coatings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pioneering strategy to enhance the environmental stability of perovskite thin films, a critical step forward in advancing their application in optoelectronics. Through the innovative application of matrix encapsulation techniques, we focus on the stabilization of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) films. These films are meticulously prepared via a two-step solution deposition method under controlled ambient conditions. Our approach involves the application of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and AZ5214 photoresist layers through spin-coating, aimed at singularly encapsulating the perovskite films. This encapsulation acts as a robust hydrophobic barrier, significantly mitigating moisture ingress and simultaneously addressing the challenge of pinhole presence within the perovskite structure. Through a series of detailed characterizations-spanning scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy-we demonstrate that, despite the thicker nature of the AZ5214 photoresist compared to the PMMA layer, it exhibits markedly enhanced stability. Notably, the integrity and optical properties of the perovskite films are preserved for extended periods of up to 960 hours under environmental exposure. This breakthrough highlights the superior performance of AZ5214 photoresist over PMMA in prolonging the operational life of perovskite thin films, thereby offering a promising avenue for their deployment in a wide range of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. It is normally limited by Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for (i).</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>
