      <title>Balanced Area Deprivation Index (bADI): Enhancing social determinants of health indices to strengthen their association with healthcare clinical outcomes, utilization and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: As value-based care expands across the U.S. healthcare system, reducing health disparities has become a priority. Social determinants of health (SDoH) indices, like the widely used Area Deprivation Index (ADI), guide efforts to manage patient health and costs. However, the ADI's reliance on housing-related variables (e.g., median home value) may reduce its effectiveness, especially in high-cost regions, by masking inequalities and poor health outcomes.
  Methods: To overcome these limitations, we developed the balanced ADI (bADI), a new SDoH index that reduces dependence on housing metrics through standardized construction. We evaluated the bADI using data from millions of Medicare Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Correlation analyses measured its association with clinical outcomes, life expectancy, healthcare use, and cost, and compared results to the ADI.
  Results: The bADI showed stronger correlations with clinical outcomes and life expectancy than the ADI. It was less influenced by housing costs in expensive regions and more accurately predicted healthcare use and costs. While ADI-based research suggested both the most and least disadvantaged groups had higher healthcare costs, the bADI revealed a more nuanced pattern, showing more accurate cost differences across groups.
  Conclusions: The bADI offers stronger predictive power for healthcare outcomes and spending, making it a valuable tool for accountable care organizations. By reallocating resources from less to more disadvantaged areas, ACOs could use the bADI to promote equity and cost-effective care within population health initiatives.</description>

      <title>Unmasking inequility: socio-economic determinants and gender disparities in Maharashtra and India's health outcomes -- Insights from NFHS-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the persistent challenge of health inequalities in India, departing from the conventional focus on aggregate improvements in mortality rates. While India has achieved progress in overall health indicators since independence, the distribution of health outcomes remains uneven, a fact starkly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the socio-economic determinants of health disparities using the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS)-5 data from 2019-20, focusing on both national and state-level analyses, specifically for Maharashtra. Employing a health economics framework, the analysis delves into individual-level data, population shares, self-reported morbidity prevalence, and treatment patterns across diverse socio-economic groups. Regression analyses, stratified by gender, are conducted to quantify the impact of socio-economic factors on reported morbidity. Furthermore, a Fairlie decomposition, an extension of the Oaxaca decomposition, is utilised to dissect the gender gap in morbidity, assessing the extent to which observed differences are attributable to explanatory variables. The findings reveal a significant burden of self-reported morbidity, with approximately one in nine individuals in India and one in eight in Maharashtra reporting morbidity. Notably, women exhibit nearly double the morbidity rate compared to men. The decomposition analysis identifies key drivers of gender disparities. In India, marital status exacerbates these differences, while insurance coverage, caste, urban residence, and wealth mitigate them. In Maharashtra, urban residence and marital status widen the gap, whereas religion, caste, and insurance coverage narrow it. This research underscores the importance of targeted policy interventions to address the complex interplay of socio-economic factors driving health inequalities in India.</description>

      <title>Valuing Diffuse Global Public Goods from Satellite Constellations: Evidence from GPS and Airline Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the welfare impact of discrete improvements to global public goods in the context of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Specifically, I find that by disabling Selective Availability in May, 2000, and thus significantly increasing the accuracy of GPS, the United States generated at least \$268 million (2000 dollars) of additional welfare gains. To quantify this welfare impact, I apply a difference-in-differences model to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics's Airline On-Time Performance Data in the years 1999 and 2000. I use this model to estimate the time saved per flight attributable to the improved GPS and multiply these time savings by the number of passengers in the ensuing year and their values of time. I conclude by estimating the economic loss from current threats to the provision of satellite-based global public goods.</description>

      <title>Industrial Flexibility Investment Under Uncertainty: A Multi-Stage Stochastic Framework Considering Energy and Reserve Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy transition toward net-zero emissions by 2050 is expected to increase the share of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) in the energy mix. As a result, industrial actors will encounter more complex market conditions, characterized by volatile electricity prices, rising carbon costs, and stricter regulations. This situation calls for the industry to capitalize on opportunities in both spot-price arbitrage and reserve market participation, while also meeting future regulatory demands. This paper presents a multi-stage optimization framework that supports investment decisions in flexible assets and enables reserve market participation by delivering ancillary services. The framework incorporates investment decisions, spot- and reserve-market bidding, and real-time operation. Uncertainty in market prices and operational conditions is handled through a nodal formulation. A case study of a large industrial site in Norway is performed, comparing the investment decisions with future technology- and carbon pricing scenarios under varying market conditions.</description>

      <title>Can knowledge reclassification accelerate technological innovation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological knowledge evolves not only through the generation of new ideas, but also through the reinterpretation of existing ones. Reinterpretations lead to changes in the classification of knowledge, that is, reclassification. This study investigates how reclassified inventions can serve as renewed sources of innovation, thereby accelerating technological progress. Drawing on patent data as a proxy for technological knowledge, I discuss two empirical patterns: (i) more recent patents are more likely to get reclassified and (ii) larger technological classes acquire proportionally more reclassified patents. Using these patterns, I develop a model that explains how reclassified inventions contribute to faster innovation. The predictions of the model are supported across all major technology domains, suggesting a strong link between reclassification and the pace of technological advancement. More generally, the model connects various, seemingly unrelated knowledge quantities, providing a basis for knowledge intrinsic explanations of growth patterns.</description>

      <title>AI as Decision-Maker: Ethics and Risk Preferences of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit surprisingly diverse risk preferences when acting as AI decision makers, a crucial characteristic whose origins remain poorly understood despite their expanding economic roles. We analyze 50 LLMs using behavioral tasks, finding stable but diverse risk profiles. Alignment tuning for harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty significantly increases risk aversion, causally increasing risk aversion confirmed via comparative difference analysis: a ten percent ethics increase cuts risk appetite two to eight percent. This induced caution persists against prompts and affects economic forecasts. Alignment enhances safety but may also suppress valuable risk taking, revealing a tradeoff risking suboptimal economic outcomes. With AI models becoming more powerful and influential in economic decisions while alignment grows increasingly critical, our empirical framework serves as an adaptable and enduring benchmark to track risk preferences and monitor this crucial tension between ethical alignment and economically valuable risk-taking.</description>

      <title>Will Neural Scaling Laws Activate Jevons' Paradox in AI Labor Markets? A Time-Varying Elasticity of Substitution (VES) Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formal economic framework to analyze whether neural scaling laws in artificial intelligence will activate Jevons' Paradox in labor markets, potentially leading to increased AI adoption and human labor substitution. By using a time-varying elasticity of substitution (VES) approach, we establish analytical conditions under which AI systems transition from complementing to substituting for human labor. Our model formalizes four interconnected mechanisms: (1) exponential growth in computational capacity ($C(t) = C(0) \cdot e^{g \cdot t}$); (2) logarithmic scaling of AI capabilities with computation ($\sigma(t) = \delta \cdot \ln(C(t)/C(0))$); (3) declining AI prices ($p_A(t) = p_A(0) \cdot e^{-d \cdot t}$); and (4) a resulting compound effect parameter ($\phi = \delta \cdot g$) that governs market transformation dynamics. We identify five distinct phases of AI market penetration, demonstrating that complete market transformation requires the elasticity of substitution to exceed unity ($\sigma &gt; 1$), with the timing determined primarily by the compound parameter $\phi$ rather than price competition alone. These findings provide an analytical framing for evaluating industry claims about AI substitution effects, especially on the role of quality versus price in the technological transition.</description>

      <title>On long-duration storage, weather uncertainty and limited foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is a key component for fully renewable, sector-coupled energy systems based on wind and solar. While capacity expansion planning has begun to take into account interannual weather variability, it often ignores weather uncertainty and limited foresight in capacity and operational decisions. We build a stochastic capacity expansion model for fully decarbonized energy systems with LDES in Europe accounting for weather uncertainty - isolating the effect of limited foresight by comparing it to a perfect foresight benchmark. Under limited foresight, LDES acts as a hedge against extreme system states operating defensively and exhibiting a stockpiling effect absent under perfect foresight. Solar PV gains in system value for its higher predictability with up to 25% higher capacities versus the benchmark while onshore wind capacities are lower. We shed light on the underlying mechanisms by deriving implicit LDES bidding curves. We show that LDES bids reflect the costs and the weather-dependent probability of extreme system states conditional on the current system state. This has important implications for the price formation on renewable electricity markets, as a wide and continuous range of probabilistic LDES bids alleviates concerns of extreme price disparity at high renewable shares.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</description>

      <title>A mix of long-duration hydrogen and thermal storage enables large-scale electrified heating in a renewable European energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is a key component of renewable energy systems to deal with seasonality and prolonged periods of low wind and solar energy availability. In this paper, we investigate how electrified heating with heat pumps impacts LDES requirements in a fully renewable European energy system, and which role thermal storage can play. Using a large weather dataset of 78 weather years, we find that electrified heating significantly increases LDES needs, as optimal average energy capacities more than quadruple across all weather years compared to a scenario without electrified heating. We attribute 75% of this increase to a leverage effect, as additional electric load amplifies storage needs during times of low renewable availability. The remaining 25% are the result of a compound effect, where exceptional cold spells coincide with periods of renewable scarcity. Furthermore, heat pumps increase the variance in optimal storage capacities between weather years substantially because of demand-side weather variability. Long-duration thermal storage attached to district heating networks can reduce LDES needs by on average 36%. To support and safeguard wide-spread heating electrification, policymakers should expedite the creation of adequate regulatory frameworks for both long-duration storage types to de-risk investments in light of high weather variability.</description>
