      <title>Identifying ballistic modes via Poincar\'e sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring chaotic systems via Poincar\'e sections has proven essential in dynamical systems, yet measuring their characteristics poses challenges to identify the various dynamical regimes considered. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses image processing to distinguish chaotic and regular regions of area-preserving dynamics, and then classify the transport regime. We characterize different transport regimes in the standard map with the proposed method based on image reconstruction techniques, identifying the superdiffusion much faster than the usual mean square displacement method. The procedure is also applied to a two-wave, time-dependent Hamiltonian to investigate superdiffusion in function of two parameters.</description>

      <title>Minimal cover of high-dimensional chaotic attractors by embedded recurrent patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.02180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general method for constructing a minimal cover of high-dimensional chaotic attractors by embedded unstable recurrent patterns. By minimal cover we mean a subset of available patterns such that the approximation of chaotic dynamics by a minimal cover with a predefined proximity threshold is as good as the approximation by the full available set. The proximity measure, based on the concept of a directed Hausdorff distance, can be chosen with considerable freedom and adapted to the properties of a given chaotic system. In the context of a spatiotemporally chaotic attractor of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky system on a periodic domain, we demonstrate that the minimal cover can be faithfully constructed even when the proximity measure is defined within a subspace of dimension much smaller than the dimension of space containing the attractor. We discuss how the minimal cover can be used to provide a reduced description of the attractor structure and the dynamics on it.</description>

      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions induced by breaking permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of disorder and chaos on quantum many-body systems can be superficially similar, yet their interplay has not been sufficiently explored. This work finds a continuous phase transition when disorder breaks permutation symmetry, with details of the transition being controlled by the degree of chaos in the clean limit. The system changes from an area law entangled phase in the permutation symmetric subspace where collective variables exist to volume law entanglement in the full Hilbert space, beyond a critical strength of the disorder. The critical strength tends to zero when the original disorder free system is fully chaotic. We study this mainly via the scaling of the collective spin of non-equilibrium states which transit to have properties of what has been dubbed "deep Hilbert space". This has potential implications for general many body physics, as well as technologies such as transmon qubits.</description>
