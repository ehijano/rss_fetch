      <title>Mammography Screening and Emergency Hospitalizations During COVID-19: Evidence from SHARE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how pandemic-related disruptions to preventive care affected severe health events among older Europeans. Using panel data from eight countries in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we exploit quasi-random variation in interview timing and COVID-19 restrictions to compare women who missed a routine mammogram with otherwise similar women who were screened. Our outcome (all-cause emergency overnight hospitalizations) captures severe acute episodes rather than cancer-specific events. Simple associations show no difference in these hospitalizations over the following year. In contrast, our instrumental-variables estimates suggest that screening reduces the probability of an emergency hospitalization by about 6 percentage points among women in the screening-eligible age range. We find no effect among women above the target age range, supporting our identification strategy. Overall, the results indicate that maintaining access to preventive services during crises can reduce avoidable acute events in ageing populations and strengthen health-system resilience to large shocks.</description>

      <title>The Big Tradeoff averted: five avenues to promote efficiency and equality simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Society as a whole faces a host of economic tradeoffs, many of which emerge around economic policies. An example of tradeoffs that any society faces in many economic realms is the tradeoff between economic efficiency and income equality (aka the efficiency-equality tradeoff). This tradeoff has been called "the Big Tradeoff" by the esteemed economist Arthur Okun, who also termed it "the Double Standard of a Capitalist Democracy." Although the efficiency-equality tradeoff is more or less an inevitable tradeoff in most societal settings and economic contexts, there are still some special circumstances in which this tradeoff can be avoided. This paper identifies five such avenues and elaborates on why and how the tradeoff between these two somewhat contradictory societal goals-efficiency and equality-can be deftly averted under the mentioned circumstances. These avenues with their transformative potential can and should be used so that a capitalist society as an integrated whole can promote both efficiency and equality at the same time under these scenarios and avoid facing the Big Tradeoff in cases where it is evitable. Static and dynamic economic models are developed, solved, and applied to facilitate the articulation and exposition of the main points of each solution with formal rigor and logical coherence. Finally, policy implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Returns to U.S. and Foreign Experience among Immigrant Men: Evidence from IPUMS Microdata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines wage returns to labor-market experience with a focus on immigrant assimilation and the portability of foreign-acquired human capital. Using U.S. Census and American Community Survey microdata from IPUMS, I study a sample of male, full-time, private-sector workers and estimate Mincer-style wage regressions with flexible experience-group indicators and fixed effects. Descriptive evidence shows that immigrants earn less than comparable non-immigrants within the same year, but that wages rise with accumulated U.S. experience. Regression results indicate strong and increasing associations between wages and total experience in the pooled sample, with smaller experience gradients among immigrants. Decomposing experience into U.S. and foreign components reveals that returns to U.S. experience are large and monotonic, while returns to foreign experience are substantially smaller across most experience bins. Country-specific evidence for recent migrants suggests steeper experience profiles for migrants from higher-income origin countries. Overall, the findings are consistent with imperfect transferability of foreign work experience and highlight the central role of host-country human capital in immigrant wage growth.</description>

      <title>Transitivity in International Trade: Evidence from Colombia-U.S. Firm Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large literature has documented transitivity as a key feature of social networks: individuals are more likely connected with each other if they share common connections with other individuals. We take this idea to trading relationships between firms: firms are more likely to trade with each other if they share common trading partners. Transitivity leads to a clustered pattern of relationship formation and break-up. It is therefore important for understanding how firms meet and how shocks propagate through firm networks. We describe a method for detecting and quantifying transitivity in firm-to-firm transactions, based on systematic deviations from conditional independence across firm-to-firm relationships. We apply the method to Colombia-U.S. exporter-importer data and show in counterfactuals that transitivity is a significant and economically meaningful factor in how firm networks adjust to cost shocks.</description>

      <title>Backward Growth Accounting: An Economic Tool for Strategic Planning of Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business growth is a goal of great importance for its both private and social benefits. Many firms view business growth as an imperative for their survival, stability, and long-term success. Business growth can be socially beneficial, too, as it enables businesses to expand into new territories where they can stimulate economic growth and development, creates more jobs, increase living standards, and better serve their communities by giving back more through Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. Business growth must be planned reasonably and optimally so that it can effectively achieve its critical ambitions in business practice. The current common practices for planning the supply side of business growth are usually ad-hoc and lack well-established mathematical and economic foundations. The present paper argues that business growth planning can be pursued more structurally, reliably, and meaningfully within the framework of Growth Accounting (GA), which was first introduced by Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Solow to study economic growth. It is shown that, although GA was initially put forth as a procedure to explain "economic growth" ex-post, it can similarly be used to plan "business growth" ex-ante when a general backward approach is taken in its procedure-called Backward Growth Accounting (BGA) in this paper. Taking this well-established economic-mathematical approach to planning business growth will enhance the current practices conceptually and structurally, as it is built on the basis of economic logic and mathematical tools. BGA can help businesses identify and plan for key drivers of output growth and assess shortcomings in the growth process, such as poor productivity, inadequate labor utilization, or insufficient capital investment. The paper outlines an eight-step procedure for planning business growth using BGA and includes appendices with real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Structured Event Representation and Stock Return Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that event features extracted by large language models (LLMs) are effective for text-based stock return prediction. Using a pre-trained LLM to extract event features from news articles, we propose a novel deep learning model based on structured event representation (SER) and attention mechanisms to predict stock returns in the cross-section. Our SER-based model provides superior performance compared with other existing text-driven models to forecast stock returns out of sample and offers highly interpretable feature structures to examine the mechanisms underlying the stock return predictability. We further provide various implications based on SER and highlight the crucial benefit of structured model inputs in stock return predictability.</description>

      <title>Owning the Intelligence: Global AI Patents Landscape and Europe's Quest for Technological Sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a key arena of global technological competition and a central concern for Europe's quest for technological sovereignty. This paper analyzes global AI patenting from 2010 to 2023 to assess Europe's position in an increasingly bipolar innovation landscape dominated by the United States and China. Using linked patent, firm, ownership, and citation data, we examine the geography, specialization, and international diffusion of AI innovation. We find a highly concentrated patent landscape: China leads in patent volumes, while the United States dominates in citation impact and technological influence. Europe accounts for a limited share of AI patents but exhibits signals of relatively high patent quality. Technological proximity reveals global convergence toward U.S. innovation trajectories, with Europe remaining fragmented rather than forming an autonomous pole. Gravity-model estimates show that cross-border AI knowledge flows are driven primarily by technological capability and specialization, while geographic and institutional factors play a secondary role. EU membership does not significantly enhance intra-European knowledge diffusion, suggesting that technological capacity, rather than political integration, underpins participation in global AI innovation networks.</description>

      <title>Wage-Setting Constraints and Firm Responses to Demand Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how institutional wage-setting constraints, such as a national minimum wage or collectively bargained wages, affect firm responses to demand shocks. We develop a framework to interpret heterogeneous shock responses that depend on the constraints firms face, and provide empirical evidence on the relevance of these constraints in shaping firm behavior across three countries with different institutional settings: Portugal, Norway, and Colombia. We discuss the implications of our findings for conventional estimates of rent-sharing and employer wage-setting power.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs for Historical Dataset Construction from Archival Image Scans: German Patents (1877-1918)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a dataset of 306,070 German patents (1877-1918) from 9,562 archival image scans using our LLM-based pipeline powered by Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite. Our benchmarking exercise provides tentative evidence that multimodal LLMs can create higher quality datasets than our research assistants, while also being more than 795 times faster and 205 times cheaper in constructing the patent dataset from our image corpus. About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools, lowering the barriers for less technical researchers. Finally, we explain the economics of deploying LLMs for historical dataset construction and conclude by speculating on the potential implications for the field of economic history.</description>

      <title>The Narrow Corridor of Stable Solutions in an Extended Osipov--Lanchester Model with Constant Total Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a modification of the classical Osipov--Lanchester model in which the total population of the two forces $N=R+B$ is preserved over time. It is shown that the dynamics of the ratio $y=R/B$ reduce to the Riccati equation $\dot y=\alpha y^2-\beta$, which admits a complete analytical study. The main result is that asymptotically stable invariant sets in the positive quadrant $R,B\ge 0$ exist exactly in three sign cases of $(\alpha,\beta)$: (i) $\alpha&lt;0,\beta&lt;0$ (stable interior equilibrium), (ii) $\alpha=0,\beta&lt;0$ (the face $B=0$ is stable), (iii) $\alpha&lt;0,\beta=0$ (the face $R=0$ is stable). For $\alpha&gt;0$ or $\beta&gt;0$ the solutions reach the boundaries of applicability of the model in finite time. Moreover, $\alpha&lt;0,\beta&lt;0$ corresponds to exponential growth of solutions in the original system. Passing to a model perturbed in $\alpha(t),\beta(t)$ requires buffer dynamics repelling from the axes to preserve stability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Smart nudging for efficient routing through networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the design of efficient digitalised deposit return schemes as a control problem. We focus on the recycling of paper cups, though the proposed methodology applies more broadly to reverse logistics systems arising in circular economy R-strategies. Each item is assumed to carry a digital wallet through which monetary rewards are allocated to actors transferring the item across successive stages, incentivising completion of the recycling process. System efficiency is ensured by: (i) decentralised algorithms that avoid congestion at individual nodes; (ii) a decentralised AIMD-based algorithm that optimally splits the deposit across layers; and (iii) a feedback control loop that dynamically adjusts the deposit to achieve a desired throughput. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations using realistic paper cup recycling data.</description>

      <title>Modular Landfill Remediation for AI Grid Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising AI electricity demand and persistent landfill methane emissions constitute coupled constraints on U.S. digital infrastructure and decarbonization. While China has achieved a rapid 'de-landfilling' transition through centralized coordination, the U.S. remains structurally 'locked in' to landfilling due to fragmented governance and carbon accounting incentives. This paper proposes a modular legacy landfill remediation framework to address these dual challenges within U.S. institutional constraints. By treating legacy sites as stock resources, the proposed system integrates excavation, screening, and behind-the-meter combined heat and power (CHP) to transform environmental liabilities into resilience assets. A system analysis of a representative AI corridor demonstrates that such modules can mitigate site-level methane by 60-70% and recover urban land, while supplying approximately 20 MW of firm, islandable power. Although contributing only approximately 5% of a hyperscale data center's bulk load, it provides critical microgrid resilience and black-start capability. We conclude that remediation-oriented waste-to-energy should be valued not as a substitute for bulk renewables, but as a strategic control volume for buffering critical loads against grid volatility while resolving long-term environmental liabilities.</description>

      <title>Instrument-Free Demand Estimation Using Relative Prices Variation, with an Application to Railway Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04424v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new identification strategy for demand estimation when cost shifters may not be available and there are substantial variations in demand over time. This approaches relies on a kind of nonlinear difference-in-differences, in which price elasticities are identified by relating changes over time in relative purchases between two goods to changes in their relative prices. We apply this strategy to the context of French railway transportation and estimate price elasticities in line with those obtained on airlines, but more negative than those generally obtained on railway transportation. We then use our demand estimation to compare the current pricing with several counterfactual pricing strategies. Our results suggest similar or better performance of the actual revenue management compared to optimal uniform pricing, but also substantial losses compared to the optimal pricing strategy. Finally, we highlight the key role of revenue management in acquiring information when demand is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Political Interventions to Reduce Single-Use Plastics (SUPs) and Price Effects: An Event Study for Austria and Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-use plastics (SUPs) impose substantial environmental costs. Following Directive (EU) 2019/904, Austria and Germany introduced producer charges and fund payments to finance clean-up. Using a high-frequency panel of retail offer spells with prices and a fixed-effects event-study design with two-way clustered standard errors, this paper estimates the extent to which these costs are passed through to consumer prices. We find clear evidence of price pass-through in Austria. Pooled Austrian SUP products are 13.01 index points more expensive than non-SUP controls within twelve months (DiD(12m); p&lt;0.001) and 19.42 points over the full post-policy period (p&lt;0.001). At the product level, highly taxed balloons exhibit strong and persistent effects (DiD(12m)=13.43, p=0.007; Full DiD=19.96, p&lt;0.001). For plastic to-go cups, the twelve-month estimate is negative but statistically insignificant (DiD(12m)=-22.73, p=0.096), while the full-period estimate is positive and likewise insignificant. In Germany, where the Single-Use Plastics Fund took effect in 2024, the post-policy window is short and estimates are not statistically significant; these results are therefore interpreted as descriptive rather than causal. As the data contain prices but not quantities, the analysis speaks to price incidence on consumers and producers, not to changes in consumption or litter.</description>

      <title>A Unified Metric Architecture for AI Infrastructure: A Cross-Layer Taxonomy Integrating Performance, Efficiency, and Cost</title>

Abstract: The growth of large-scale AI systems is increasingly constrained by infrastructure limits: power availability, thermal and water constraints, interconnect scaling, memory pressure, data-pipeline throughput, and rapidly escalating lifecycle cost. Across hyperscale clusters, these constraints interact, yet the main metrics remain fragmented. Existing metrics, ranging from facility measures (PUE) and rack power density to network metrics (all-reduce latency), data-pipeline measures, and financial metrics (TCO series), each capture only their own domain and provide no integrated view of how physical, computational, and economic constraints interact. This fragmentation obscures the structural relationships among energy, computation, and cost, preventing a coherent optimization across sector and how bottlenecks emerge, propagate, and jointly determine the efficiency frontier of AI infrastructure.
  This paper develops an integrated framework that unifies these disparate metrics through a three-domain semantic classification and a six-layer architectural decomposition, producing a 6x3 taxonomy that maps how various sectors propagate across the AI infrastructure stack. The taxonomy is grounded in a systematic review and meta-analysis of all metrics with economic and financial relevance, identifying the most widely used measures, their research intensity, and their cross-domain interdependencies. Building on this evidence base, the Metric Propagation Graph (MPG) formalizes cross-layer dependencies, enabling systemwide interpretation, composite-metric construction, and multi-objective optimization of energy, carbon, and cost.
  The framework offers a coherent foundation for benchmarking, cluster design, capacity planning, and lifecycle economic analysis by linking physical operations, computational efficiency, and cost outcomes within a unified analytic structure.</description>

      <title>Location-Robust Cost-Preserving Blended Pricing for Multi-Campus AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale AI data center portfolios procure identical SKUs across geographically heterogeneous campuses, yet finance and operations require a single system-level 'world price' per SKU for budgeting and planning. A common practice is deployment-weighted blending of campus prices, which preserves total cost but can trigger Simpson-type aggregation failures: heterogeneous location mixes can reverse SKU rankings and distort decision signals.
  I formalize cost-preserving blended pricing under location heterogeneity and propose two practical operators that reconcile accounting identity with ranking robustness and production implementability. A two-way fixed-effects operator separates global SKU effects from campus effects and restores exact cost preservation via scalar normalization, providing interpretable decomposition and smoothing under mild missingness. A convex common-weight operator computes a single set of campus weights under accounting constraints to enforce a location-robust benchmark and prevent dominance reversals; I also provide feasibility diagnostics and a slack-based fallback for extreme mix conditions. Simulations and an AI data center OPEX illustration show substantial reductions in ranking violations relative to naive blending while maintaining cost accuracy, with scalable distributed implementation.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees with Multi-Population and Non-Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves the equilibrium price formation problem for the risky stock by combining mean-field game theory with the binomial tree framework, adapting the classic approach of Cox, Ross \&amp; Rubinstein. For agents with exponential and recursive utilities of exponential-type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field market-clearing equilibrium and derive an explicit analytic formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price on the binomial lattice. The agents face stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments that depend on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. We also incorporate an external order flow. Furthermore, the analytic tractability of the proposed approach allows us to extend the framework in two important directions: First, we incorporate multi-population heterogeneity, allowing agents to differ in functional forms for their liabilities, endowments, and risk coefficients. Second, we relax the rational expectations hypothesis by modeling agents operating under subjective probability measures which induce stochastically biased views on the stock transition probabilities. Our numerical examples illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>
