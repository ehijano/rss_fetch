      <title>Fast Parameter Optimization of Delayed Feedback Reservoir with Backpropagation and Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a reservoir computing system well-suited for hardware implementations. However, achieving high accuracy in DFRs depends heavily on selecting appropriate hyperparameters. Conventionally, due to the presence of a non-linear circuit block in the DFR, the grid search has only been the preferred method, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming and thus performed offline. This paper presents a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for DFRs. To this end, we leverage the well-known backpropagation and gradient descent framework with the state-of-the-art DFR model for the first time to facilitate parameter optimization. We further propose a truncated backpropagation strategy applicable to the recursive dot-product reservoir representation to achieve the highest accuracy with reduced memory usage. With the proposed lightweight implementation, the computation time has been significantly reduced by up to 1/700 of the grid search.</description>

      <title>Mixed Structural Choice Operator: Enhancing Technology Mapping with Heterogeneous Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independence of logic optimization and technology mapping poses a significant challenge in achieving high-quality synthesis results. Recent studies have improved optimization outcomes through collaborative optimization of multiple logic representations and have improved structural bias through structural choices. However, these methods still rely on technology-independent optimization and fail to truly resolve structural bias issues. This paper proposes a scalable and efficient framework based on Mixed Structural Choices (MCH). This is a novel heterogeneous mapping method that combines multiple logic representations with technology-aware optimization. MCH flexibly integrates different logic representations and stores candidates for various optimization strategies. By comprehensively evaluating the technology costs of these candidates, it enhances technology mapping and addresses structural bias issues in logic synthesis. Notably, the MCH-based lookup table (LUT) mapping algorithm set new records in the EPFL Best Results Challenge by combining the structural strengths of both And-Inverter Graph (AIG) and XOR-Majority Graph (XMG) logic representations. Additionally, MCH-based ASIC technology mapping achieves a 3.73% area and 8.94% delay reduction (balanced), 20.35% delay reduction (delay-oriented), and 21.02% area reduction (area-oriented), outperforming traditional structural choice methods. Furthermore, MCH-based logic optimization utilizes diverse structures to surpass local optima and achieve better results.</description>

      <title>RealProbe: An Automated and Lightweight Performance Profiler for In-FPGA Execution of High-Level Synthesis Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates FPGA design by rapidly generating diverse implementations using optimization directives. However, even with cycle-accurate C/RTL co-simulation, the reported clock cycles often differ significantly from actual FPGA performance. This discrepancy hampers accurate bottleneck identification, leading to suboptimal design choices. Existing in-FPGA profiling tools, such as the Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA), require tedious inspection of HLS-generated RTL and manual signal monitoring, reducing productivity. To address these challenges, we introduce RealProbe, the first fully automated, lightweight in-FPGA profiling tool for HLS designs. With a single directive--#pragma HLS RealProbe--the tool automatically generates all necessary code to profile cycle counts across the full function hierarchy, including submodules and loops. RealProbe extracts, records, and visualizes cycle counts with high precision, providing actionable insights into on-board performance. RealProbe is non-intrusive, implemented as independent logic to ensure minimal impact on kernel functionality or timing. It also supports automated design space exploration (DSE), optimizing resource allocation based on FPGA constraints and module complexity. By leveraging incremental synthesis and implementation, DSE runs independently of the original HLS kernel. Evaluated across 28 diverse test cases, including a large-scale design, RealProbe achieves 100% accuracy in capturing cycle counts with minimal logic overhead-just 16.98% LUTs, 43.15% FFs, and 0% BRAM usage. The tool, with full documentation and examples, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/sharc-lab/RealProbe .</description>

      <title>Scaling up Reversible Logic with HKI Superconducting Inductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers developed about a dozen semiconductor reversible (or adiabatic) logic chips since the early 1990s, validating circuit designs and proving the concept--but scale up required a further advance. This document shows that cryogenic inductors made of a new High Kinetic Inductance (HKI) material provide the advance. This material can be deposited as an integrated circuit layer, where it has enough energy recycling capacity to power a reversible circuit of the same size. This allows a designer to replicate and scale a complete reversible logic subsystem in accordance with Moore's law.</description>
