      <title>Dark Matter Axion Detection with Neural Networks at Ultra-Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analysis of Dark Matter axion detection applying neural networks for the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio. The main sources of thermal noise from a typical read-out chain are simulated, constituted by resonant and amplifier noises. With this purpose, an advanced modal method employed in electromagnetic modal analysis for the design of complex microwave circuits is applied. A feedforward neural network is used for a boolean decision (there is axion or only noise), and robust results are obtained: the neural network can improve by a factor of 50 the integration time needed to reach a given signal to noise ratio. This could either significantly reduce measurement times or achieve lower sensitivities with the same exposure durations.</description>

      <title>Measurements of $t\bar{t}$ in association with charm quarks at 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This talk presents the ATLAS Collaboration's first measurement of the inclusive cross-section for top-quark pair production in association with charm quarks. Using the full Run 2 proton-proton collision data sample at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC between 2015 and 2018, the measurement selects $t\bar{t}$ events with one or two charged leptons and at least one additional jet in the final state. A custom flavour-tagging algorithm is employed to simultaneously identify $b$-jets and $c$-jets. The fiducial cross-sections for $t\bar{t}+{\geq}2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ production are found to largely agree with predictions from various $t\bar{t}$ simulations, though all underpredict the observed values.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy scalar or pseudoscalar states in $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ events at CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for scalar or pseudoscalar states decaying to a top quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$), using $138\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of pp collision data taken at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ using the CMS detector, is presented. Events with one or two leptons are analyzed using the invariant $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ mass ($m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$) as well as angular and spin correlation observables. An excess in the data is observed for low values of $m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$, preferring a pseudoscalar over a scalar hypothesis. It is interpreted in terms of a generic model of (pseudo)scalar boson production, as well as a simplified model of a $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ bound state ($\eta_{\mathrm{t}}$), yielding good agreement with the data. Moreover, limits on the couplings of additional (pseudo)scalar bosons to top quarks are set.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the light collection stability of a PEN-based wavelength shifting reflector in a tonne scale liquid argon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors rely on wavelength shifters for efficient detection of scintillation light. The current standard is tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), but it is challenging to instrument on a large scale. Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a polyester easily manufactured as thin sheets, could simplify the coverage of large surfaces with wavelength shifters. Previous measurements have shown that commercial grades of PEN have approximately 50% light conversion efficiency relative to TPB. Encouraged by these results, we conducted a large-scale measurement using $4~m^2$ combined PEN and specular reflector foils in a two-tonne liquid argon dewar to assess its stability over approximately two weeks. This test is crucial for validating PEN as a viable substitute for TPB. The setup used for the measurement of the stability of PEN as a wavelength shifter is described, together with the first results, showing no evidence of performance deterioration over a period of 12 days.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and wave functions of toponia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a linear plus Coulomb potential and conduct a meticulous study of the mass spectrum and wave function of toponium. Our investigation reveals that, owing to the exceedingly heavy mass of the top quark, the mass splitting between singlet and triplet states, as well as within the triplet states, is negligible. Consequently, relativistic corrections can be safely disregarded in the study of toponium. As such, we present the nonrelativistic wave functions for $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave toponia and study the decays $\eta_t\to \gamma\gamma$, $\eta_t\to gg$, and $\Theta\to \ell^+\ell^-$.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ are still absent in the quark model.</description>

      <title>Test RG Running of the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the possibility of using the near detector at reactor neutrino experiments to probe the renormalization group (RG) running effect on the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_D$. Although the reactor neutrino oscillation cannot directly measure $\delta_D$, it can probe the deviation $\Delta \delta \equiv \delta_D(Q^2_d) - \delta_D(Q^2_p)$ caused by the RG running. Being a key element, the mismatched momentum transfers at neutrino production ($Q^2_p$) and detection ($Q^2_d$) processes can differ by two orders. We illustrate this concept with the upcoming JUNO-TAO experiment and obtain the projected sensitivity to the CP RG running beta function $\beta_\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been discovered in the past two decades. Investigations of these states can lead to deep understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. In this concise review, we focus on the productions of exotic hadrons in $pp$, $p\bar p$, and nuclear collisions. Experimental observations of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as prototypes of hadronic molecules, in heavy ion collisions will also be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Study of the exotic three-body $N D^* \bar{K}^*$ system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the $N D^* \bar{K}^*$ system in the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation to the Faddeev equations, taking the exotic $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system as the cluster and allowing the N to interact with the components of the cluster. Previous studies have determined the existence of three states of spin $0,1,2$ for the $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system, the one of spin $0$ associated to the $X_0(2900)$ state observed by the LHCb collaboration. From this perspective, we find five states with total spin $1/2,3/2,5/2$, with bindings from $10$ to $30$ MeV and widths below $60$ MeV, which could be well identified. We also discuss the decay channels of these states that should help in future experimental searches of these states.</description>

      <title>CP violation observables in baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of baryon physics is on the horizon with the accumulation of increasing data by collaborations such as LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII. Despite the wealth of data, one of the critical issues in flavor physics, namely CP violation in baryon decays, still awaits experimental confirmation. It is evident that the development of formulas and phenomenological analyses will play a pivotal role in advancing theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in this domain. In this work, we discuss the fundamental definitions and properties of polarization, asymmetry parameters and their associated CP violating observables that may arise in baryon decays. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of b-baryon quasi-two and -three body decays based on angular distributions. We highlight the significance of CP asymmetries defined by spin and momentum correlations, as non-trivial spin distributions are expected in baryon decays due to their non-zero polarization in productions and decays. Of particular importance is a complementary relation can be establised for two different types of observables, that are $\mathcal{T}$-even and -odd CP asymmetries respectively. The complementarity indicates that one observable exhibits the sine dependence on strong phase $\Delta\delta$, while another exhibits as cosine. This gives us an distinctive opportunity to avoid the potential large suppression to CP asymmetries from small phase $\Delta\delta$. Two points (\textbf{i}) the exact proof of strong phase dependence behaviour, and (\textbf{ii}) the criterion for complementary observables are clarified. Based on these arguments from theoretical aside, some brief discussions and suggestions on experimental measurements are offered in the final discussions. Lastly, we present a pedagogical introduction to angular distribution techniques based on helicity descriptions for both two and three body decays.</description>

      <title>Implications on CP violation of charmless three body decays of bottom baryon from the U-spin analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent LHCb measurements of CP violation in $\Lambda_b$ three-body decays, we conduct an analysis of CP asymmetry in three-body decays of bottom baryons utilizing U-spin symmetry. We first develop a convenient representation that facilitates the incorporation of U-spin symmetry into our analysis. By integrating weak and strong phases into the derived amplitude, we obtain the CP asymmetry and establish relationships between CP asymmetries in U-spin related decay channels. With the help of experimental measurements, we provide numerical predictions for the CP asymmetries for other decay channels, particularly $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ K^-$, $\Xi^0_b \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ \pi^-$, and $\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma K^- \pi^+$. Furthermore, we provide a quantity that can be used as a null test of standard model and deviations from 0 will reflect the possible new physics. These results are valuable for CPV measurements in baryon decays, and can be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>A tale of Bethe logarithms: leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}$ and Lamb shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare annihilation decays of $P$-wave spin-triplet quarkonia into lepton pair have to proceed via two-photon intermediate state, which are plagued with the infrared divergence symptom. We recognize that the physical root of the IR divergence and its remedy is the same as the Lamb shift in QED. In this work we provide a complete solution to this IR problem by including the effect of the higher Fock component of the $\chi_{cJ}$ state, {\it viz.}, the $c\bar{c}(^3S_1^{(1)})$ pair accompanied with a very long wavelength photon. Adding the contributions from the leading and next-to-leading order Fock components together, we arrive at the IR finite and factorization scale independent predictions for leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$. The Bethe logarithms associated with these exclusive reactions are found to have rather different traits from those associated with Lamb shift. We present numerical predictions by employing several influential quark potential models. The predicted leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$ are sizable and the observation prospect for $e^+e^-\to \chi_{cJ}(1P,2P)$ at BESIII looks bright. The future observation of $e^+e^-\to X(3872)$ will shed important light on the $c\bar{c}$ content of the $X(3872)$ meson.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scale Variations: Perturbative Theory Uncertainties from Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in perturbative predictions (the perturbative "theory uncertainty"), which overcomes many inherent limitations of the currently prevalent methods based on varying unphysical renormalization scales. In our approach, the true underlying sources of the theory uncertainty, namely the missing higher-order terms, are identified and parameterized in terms of mutually independent theory nuisance parameters (TNPs). The TNPs are true parameters of the calculation, i.e., they have a well-defined true value that is not or only imprecisely known. This approach affords the theory uncertainty all benefits of a truly parametric uncertainty: It provides correct correlations and allows for consistent error propagation and combination. Furthermore, the TNPs can be profiled in fits, allowing the data to reduce the theory uncertainties. On the theory side, it allows maximally exploiting all available higher-order information to reduce the theory uncertainty, such as partial higher-order results or any nontrivial knowledge of the higher-order or all-order structure. We first discuss the method in general as it can be applied across the board of perturbative calculations. As a concrete application, we then discuss the resummed transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum in Drell-Yan production, and how TNP-based uncertainties can correctly capture the correlations across the $q_T$ spectrum and between $Z$ and $W$ production. This application is the basis of the theory model enabling the recent precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass by the CMS experiment. In a forthcoming paper, we use it to study the theory uncertainties in extracting the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Real Higgs Triplet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the Standard Model extended by a $Y=0$ real Higgs triplet, the $\Delta$SM. It contains a $CP$-even neutral Higgs ($\Delta^0$) and two charged Higgs bosons ($\Delta^\pm$), which are quasi-degenerate in mass. We first study the theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity and then calculate the Higgs decays, including the loop-induced modes such as di-photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and $Z\gamma$. In the limit of a small mixing between the SM Higgs and $\Delta^0$, the latter decays dominantly to $WW$ and can have a sizable branching ratio to di-photon. The model predicts a positive definite shift in the $W$ mass, which agrees with the current global electroweak fit. At the Large Hadron Collider, it leads to a $(i)$ stau-like signature from $pp\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to \tau^+\tau^-\nu\bar\nu$, $(ii)$ multi-lepton final states from $pp\to \gamma^*\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to W^+W^-ZZ$ and $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm\Delta^0\to W^\pm Z W^+W^-$ as well as $(iii)$ associated di-photon production from $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$. Concerning $(i)$, the reinterpretation of the recent supersymmetric tau partner search by ATLAS and CMS excludes $m_{\Delta^\pm}&lt;110$ GeV at 95% CL. From $(ii)$, some of the signal regions of multi-lepton searches lead to bounds close to the predicted cross-section, but electroweak scale masses are still allowed. For $(iii)$, the recast of the associated di-photon searches by ATLAS and a combined log-likelihood fit of signal and background to data find that out of the 25 signal regions, 10 provide relevant limits on Br$(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$ at the per cent level. Interestingly, 6 signal regions show excesses at around 152 GeV, leading to a preference for a non-zero di-photon branching ratio of about 0.7% with the corresponding significance amounting to about $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Search for $CP$-Violating Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions with the NOvA Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter reports a search for charge-parity ($CP$) symmetry violating nonstandard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters. Data from $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ and $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ oscillation channels are used to measure the effect of the NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$. With 90% CL the magnitudes of the NSI couplings are constrained to be $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \, \lesssim 0.3$ and $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \lesssim 0.4$. A degeneracy at $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \approx 1.8$ is reported, and we observe that the presence of NSI limits sensitivity to the standard $CP$ phase $\delta_{\tiny\text{CP}}$.</description>

      <title>Searches for pair-produced multijet resonances using data scouting in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for pair-produced multijet signatures using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 128 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are presented. A data scouting technique is employed to record events with low jet scalar transverse momentum sum values. The electroweak production of particles predicted in $R$-parity violating supersymmetric models is probed for the first time with fully hadronic final states. This is the first search for prompt hadronically decaying mass-degenerate higgsinos, and extends current exclusions on $R$-parity violating top squarks and gluinos.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Signals in Timing Spectra at Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity to dark matter signals at neutrino experiments is fundamentally challenged by the neutrino rates, as they leave similar signatures in their detectors. As a way to improve the signal sensitivity, we investigate a dark matter search strategy which utilizes the timing and energy spectra to discriminate dark matter from neutrino signals at low-energy, pulsed-beam neutrino experiments. This strategy was proposed in our companion paper arXiv:1906.10745, which we apply to potential searches at COHERENT, JSNS$^2$, and CCM. These experiments are not only sources of neutrinos but also high intensity sources of photons. The dark matter candidate of interest comes from the relatively prompt decay of a dark sector gauge boson which may replace a Standard-Model photon, so the delayed neutrino events can be suppressed by keeping prompt events only. Furthermore, prompt neutrino events can be rejected by a cut in recoil energy spectra, as their incoming energy is relatively small and bounded from above while dark matter may deposit a sizable energy beyond it. We apply the search strategy of imposing a combination of energy and timing cuts to the existing CsI data of the COHERENT experiment as a concrete example, and report a mild excess beyond known backgrounds. We then investigate the expected sensitivity reaches to dark matter signals in our benchmark experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Observatory (JUNO) is a 20-kton liquid scintillator detector that employs 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as photon sensors, with 5,000 dynode-PMTs from HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K. (HPK), and 15,000 MCP-PMTs from North Night Vision Technology (NNVT) installed in pure water. JUNO aims to provide long-lasting and the best performance operation by utilizing a high-transparency liquid scintillator, high detection efficiency PMTs, and specially designed electronics including water-proof potting for the high voltage (HV) dividers of PMTs. In this paper, we present a summary of the design and optimization of HV dividers for both types of 20-inch PMTs, which includes collection efficiency, charge resolution, HV divider current, pulse shape, and maximum amplitude restriction. We have developed and finalized four schemes of the HV divider for different scenarios, including the final version selected by JUNO. All 20,000 20-inch PMTs have successfully undergone production and burning tests.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral and flavored $Z^\prime$ from cosmic bursts through neutrino interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We consider $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking of $U(1)$ and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where $Z^\prime$ interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on $Z^\prime-$neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrain $U(1)$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and $Z^\prime$ mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$ under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study $\nu-$DM scattering through $Z^\prime$ to constrain $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-$\alpha$ data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane from scattering, beam-dump and $g-2$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Particles Anomaly Detection with Parametrized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm has been trained on a classical computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests on NISQ devices have been performed with IBM quantum computers. For the execution on quantum hardware specific hardware driven adaptations have been devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm is able to detect simple anomalies like different characters in handwritten digits as well as more complex structures like anomalous patterns in the particle detectors produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider experiment. For the high-energy physics application, performance is estimated in simulation only, as the quantum circuit is not simple enough to be executed on the available quantum hardware. This work demonstrates that it is possible to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms, however, as amplitude encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in the available quantum hardware, current implementation cannot outperform classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today due to the presence of experimental uncertainties. In fact, a purely kinematical triangle diagram is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements with a reasonably high accuracy of discrimination between the two seemingly identical line shapes. We also identify the type of triangle enhancement that can be misidentified as a dynamic pole structure. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a triangle singularity, but is more consistent with a pole-based interpretation, as determined solely through pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we explain how our method can be used as a model-selection framework useful in studying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning based photon counting for PMT waveforms and its application to the improvement of the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in particle experiments for photon detection. PMT waveform analysis is crucial for high-precision measurements of the position and energy of incident particles in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. A key factor contributing to the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors with PMTs is the charge smearing of PMTs. This paper presents a machine-learning-based photon counting method for PMT waveforms and its application to the energy reconstruction, using the JUNO experiment as an example.The results indicate that leveraging the photon counting information from the machine learning model can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge smearing and lead to a relative 2.0% to 2.8% improvement on the energy resolution in the energy range of [1, 9] MeV.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correcting for detector effects in experimental data, particularly through unfolding, is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel approach to multidimensional object-wise unfolding using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, incorporating distribution moments as conditioning information, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions, while enabling the unfolding of a wide range of measured distributions with improved adaptability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering at $\sqrt{s} = 6$ GeV up to $ \sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV (proton-proton; proton-antiproton; proton-neutron)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, a simultaneous analysis is carried out of 90 sets of data. These sets include the data were obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and high energies at FNAL, ISR, $SP\bar{P}S$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the data of $A_N$. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is found. The importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the CNI region and at large $t$ are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron and the additional term with a large slope have energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term with $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that the additional terms with large slope are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term and oscillation term are proportional to matter distributions. Also, a good description of proton-neutron differential scattering with 526 experimental points is obtained on the basis of the amplitudes taken from the analysis of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering. A good description of the $A_N$ data was also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a spin 2 resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A420Z could come from a H650 resonance degenerate in mass with T650. We propose a scheme in which scalar resonances are accommodated in three doublets, T650 in an isosinglet, T450++, T375+ and T350 belong to an isofiveplet.</description>

      <title>Mapping of the Transient Electric Field Created by the Charge Spreading on the Resistive Strip of Micromegas used in the ATLAS New Small Wheels</title>

Abstract: Resistive strips Micromegas are employed in the ATLAS New Small Wheel project. They have been already installed and operate in the experimental cavern of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This work attempts to describe the mechanism of the surface electric charge spread on a resistive strip of the Micromegas detector and the created transient electric field. Moreover, an approach utilising the Telegraph partial differential equation, used in transmission lines, is discussed assuming a 2-layer geometry approximation. Finally, the transient electric field formation leading to the strong suppression of the sparks in the amplification region is calculated by using the accurate 3-layer geometry for the particular parameters of the Micromegas configuration. The spatial mapping of this field versus time is presented for the time slice of interest.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter(subdominant) including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves very high velocity. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from elastic scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two component dark matter scenario, we show that the boost of the dark matter, kinetic energy and its attenuation highly depend on the dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study of the attenuation of boosted dark matter as a function of the DM-nucleus (without/with form factor) and DM-electron cross sections. For a 10 MeV dark matter with boost $\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) for scattering cross sections $\sim 10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also found that the attenuation of the kinetic energy results in a shift in the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux.</description>

      <title>High-lying states in the charmonium family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies above 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $D$-, $F$-, and $G$-wave states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II and LHCb.</description>
