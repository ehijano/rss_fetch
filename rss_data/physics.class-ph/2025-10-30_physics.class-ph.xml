      <title>On the perturbed harmonic oscillator and celestial mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of perturbations in the three dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator problem considering different perturbing force laws and apply our results in the context of celestial mechanics, particularly in the movement of stars in stellar clusters. We use a method based on the Runge-Lenz tensor, so that our results are valid for any eccentricity of the unperturbed orbits of the oscillator. To establish basic concepts, we start by considering two cases, namely: a Larmor and a keplerian perturbation; and show that, in both cases, the perturbed orbits will precess. After that, we consider the more general problem of a central perturbation with any power-law dependence, that also only causes precession. Then, we consider precessionless perturbations caused by an Euler force and by the non-central dragging forces of the form $\boldsymbol{\delta F}=-\gamma_nv^{n-1}\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\boldsymbol{v}$ is the velocity of the particle and $\gamma_n\geq0$. We demonstrate that, in the case of a linear drag $(n=1)$, the orbits eccentricities remains constant. In contrast to what occurs in the well-known Kepler problem, for $n&gt;1$ the orbit becomes increasingly eccentric. In the case $n=-3$, where the force is interpreted as a Chandrasekhar friction, we show that the eccentricity diminishes over time. We finish this work by making a few comments about the relevance of the main results.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Transfer Framework Unifies High-Velocity Impact and Failure Across Materials, Geometries, and Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that dissipate energy efficiently under high-speed impacts, from micrometeoroid strikes on spacecraft to bullet penetration into protective gear, are essential for preserving structural integrity in extreme environments. Conventional projectile-impact models, based on conservation laws and energy partitioning, often rely on constitutive- and geometry-specific empirical corrections because the projectile-target system is rarely closed and most material behaviors under extreme thermo-mechanical loading remain elusive. In contrast, we show that momentum transfer, governed by the collision impulse, provides a fundamental and unifying description of impact response across a broad spectrum of materials, geometries, and loading conditions. With microprojectile impact tests across varied geometries and scales, validated by targeted macroscale experiments, we examine the interplay of two dominant momentum transfer pathways: material cohesion and target inertia, supported by conclusive evidence from post-perforation microscopy. We reveal a universal upper bound at the ballistic-limit velocity corresponding to the maximum projectile deceleration, which persists across materials, scales, and architectures in both our data and prior studies. By extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape, we identify its parametric dependence across geometry and scale and correct an entrenched misconception that the impact response is not scale-invariant for self-similar geometries. Furthermore, we reveal that specific energy absorption exaggerates the performance of thinner targets by inflating their apparent energy capacity. This work not only redefines how high-velocity projectile perforation is understood but also establishes a framework that applies broadly to momentum-driven dynamic events such as cold spray deposition, surface mechanical attrition treatment, and meteorite impacts.</description>
