      <title>Variational and Monte Carlo Methods for Bayesian Inversion of Dynamic Subsurface Flow Simulations Using Seismic and Fluid Pressure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to predict future performance of subsurface fluid reservoirs under possible operating scenarios, a dynamic, porous-medium flow simulation model must be tuned to include representative properties of the reservoir. Estimating subsurface reservoir properties given remotely sensed or borehole-based observations typically involves finding the solution to a challenging inverse problem. We compare Monte Carlo random sampling to variational inference methods which use optimisation to constrain parametrised uncertainties in nonlinear Bayesian inversions. We use them to estimate the posterior probability distribution of reservoir permeability given fluid pressure and seismic measurements. The methods include automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI), Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), and a Monte Carlo method called stochastic SVGD (sSVGD), all of which we benchmark against results from Metropolis-Hastings McMC. We also test an ADVI variant called physically structured variational inference (PSVI): in our implementation this method estimates only spatially-local correlations between model parameters based on the intuition that such correlations are strong in remote sensing problems in which data only inform about spatial-averages of local dynamics. We apply the methods to two- and three-dimensional inverse problems of carbon dioxide storage, inspired by the Endurance field, located in the UK North Sea. Results show that PSVI achieves a good balance between mean-field ADVI and full-rank ADVI in terms of accuracy of the posterior approximation and computational efficiency. SVGD and sSVGD offer more accurate approximations of the target posterior distribution, but at far higher computational cost. Between them, sSVGD outperforms SVGD, exhibiting better computational efficiency and mitigating the problems of mode collapse and spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for rockfall impact fragmentation emerging from diverse lithologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact-induced fragmentation is a fundamental dissipative process in geosciences, yet its stochastic nature makes predicting debris evolution a persistent challenge. Here, we introduce a discrete element framework to resolve fragmentation mechanics across a diverse lithological spectrum, from high-strength siliciclastic units to massive carbonates, validated against high-resolution field data from documented rockfall events. Our results reveal that, despite the inherent randomness of impact dynamics, fragment size distributions consistently follow a universal Weibull scaling law, independent of lithology or initial kinetic energy. By applying a relative breakage index, we demonstrate a remarkable collapse of fragmentation data onto a single statistical signature, bridging the gap between grain-scale fracture and macroscopic debris evolution. We find that this Weibullian signature acts as a proxy for lithological sensitivity, reflecting distinct efficiencies in converting kinetic energy into new fracture surfaces. This framework explicitly resolves the energy partitioning between surviving blocks and comminuted debris, providing a robust predictive link between impact mechanics and structural resilience. From an engineering perspective, our findings enable a shift from idealised single-block impact assumptions toward a realistic assessment of distributed energy in fragmented particle clouds, offering a physical basis for optimising protective galleries and hazard mitigation strategies in complex mountainous terrains.</description>

      <title>Radial gradient of superionic hydrogen in Earth's inner core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is considered a major light element in Earth's core, yet the thermodynamics of its superionic phase and its distribution in the inner core remain unclear. Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core.</description>

      <title>Thermal Comfort Path Planning Tool for Urban Mobility in Austin, Texas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme heat poses a growing challenge for active transportation in cities like Austin, Texas, where conventional weather reporting (e.g. a single air temperature measurement for the whole city) fails to capture the large microclimate variations that pedestrians and cyclists actually experience. We present a novel walking and biking route planner that selects paths based on thermal comfort using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) (Jendritzky et al., 2012) rather than just distance or travel time. This system combines high-resolution thermal modeling with real-time route mapping. We generate city-scale UTCI maps using SOLWEIG-GPU (Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry), to account for urban features (buildings, trees, etc.) and weather conditions (Lindberg et al., 2008; Kamath et al., 2026). For any given origin and destination, our tool calculates the average UTCI along each possible route and recommends the 'coolest' route, i.e. the path with the lowest heat stress (often the most shaded or otherwise thermally comfortable), while still being reasonably direct. In a case study for Austin, this approach identifies routes that significantly reduce pedestrians' heat exposure (often recommending routes with a much larger proportion of shade). Such thermally-informed route planning has important public health implications: by helping people avoid dangerous heat hotspots and sun-exposed areas, it can reduce the risk of heat-related illness and make walking or biking a safer choice even on hot days. This paper describes the motivation, methodology, results, and implications of the thermal comfort path planner, emphasizing the role of shade and thermal comfort in urban mobility and heat mitigation.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator Emulator for Coastal and Riverine Shallow Water Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coastal regions and river floodplains are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. Yet high-fidelity numerical models are often too computationally expensive for real-time use, and lower-cost approaches, such as traditional model order reduction algorithms or conventional neural networks, typically struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution conditions. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs latent-space operator learning to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. We showcase MITONet's predictive capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics in the Shinnecock Inlet in New York and riverine flow in a section of the Red River in Louisiana, both described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations (2D SWE), while incorporating initial conditions, time-varying boundary conditions, and domain parameters such as the bottom friction coefficient. Despite the distinct flow regimes, the complex geometries and meshes, and the wide range of bottom friction coefficients studied, MITONet displays consistently high predictive skill, with anomaly correlation coefficients above 0.9, a maximum normalized root mean square error of 0.011, and computational speedups between 100x-1,250x, even for 175 days of autoregressive rollout forecast from random initial conditions and with unseen parameter values.</description>
