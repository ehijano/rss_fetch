      <title>Quantum phases and transitions of bosons on a comb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated to elucidate the nature of quantum phases and their criticality when entangled with a correlated quantum bath, we study interacting bosons on a "comb lattice" -- a one-dimensional backbone (system) coupled at its sites to otherwise independent one-dimensional "teeth" chains (bath). We map out the corresponding phase diagram, detailing the nature of the phases and phase transitions. Controlled by the backbone and teeth hopping amplitudes, on-site interaction and chemical potential, phases include a Mott-insulator (MI), backbone (LLb) and teeth (LLp) Luttinger liquids, and the long-range ordered incoherent superfluid (iSF). We explore their properties and potential realizations in condensed matter and cold-atom experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Control, competition and coexistence of effective magnetic orders by interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates with high-Q cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atom systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Critical velocity for wake vortex generation behind a plate in a superflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the critical velocity $U_c$ for quantum vortex generation by a thin plate-shaped obstacle moving through a uniform Bose-Einstein condensate. Our results based on the Gross-Pitaevskii theory reveal that the critical velocity monotonically decreases with increasing plate size $L$. In the limit of large $L$, the critical velocity is asymptotic to $L^{-1/2}$ predicted by the potential flow theory for an incompressible ideal fluid with a phenomenological length correction. As $L$ decreases, however, the incompressible analysis breaks down quantitatively. By performing a perturbative analysis to incorporate compressibility into the potential flow theory, we have successfully reproduced the numerical results analytically over a wide parameter range. It is also shown that the critical velocity increases with finite plate thickness.</description>

      <title>Collisional scattering of strongly interacting D-band Feshbach molecules in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excited bands in optical lattices manifest an important tool for studying quantum simulation and many-body physics, making it crucial to measure high-band scattering dynamics under strong interactions. This work investigates both experimentally and theoretically the collisional scattering of $^{6}\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the $D$ band of a one-dimensional optical lattice, with interaction strength directly tunable via magnetic Feshbach resonance. We find a clear dependence of the $D$-band lifetimes on the interaction strength within the strongly interacting regime, which arises from the fact that the scattering cross-section is proportional to the square of the scattering length. The maximum lifetime versus lattice depth is measured to reveal the effects of interactions. We also investigate the scattering channels of $D$-band molecules under different interaction levels and develop a reliable two-body scattering rate equation. This work provides insight into the interplay between interaction and the collisional scattering of high-band bosons in optical lattices, paving the way for research into strong correlation effects in high-band lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative parametric resonance in a modulated 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesize results of previous works to give a coherent and self-consistent account of parametric resonance in a modulated quasi-1D Bose gas in the presence of a dissipative mechanism. The resonant behaviour is shown to be largely in line with the predictions of a phenomenological model published in 2014, while the associated dissipation rate is consistent with that derived in 2022 from three-wave mixing processes between the produced phonons and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Optically tuned soliton dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates within dark traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation and dynamics of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) within dark traps generated by two crossed Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with varying azimuthal indices $\ell$. As the index $\ell$ increases, the potential transitions from a harmonic trap when $\ell = 1$ to a square-well potential for larger values of $\ell$. This transition allows us to study a range of soliton dynamics under different confinement conditions while maintaining the same BEC volume. Through the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and under these specific conditions in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) configurations, we explore the dynamics of solitons across multiple scenarios. The study examines two primary methods for solitons generation: the temporal modulation of the scattering length and the implementation of an initial potential barrier that is subsequently removed. The results indicate that the trap shape plays a critical role in the generation and interaction dynamics of solitons. In harmonic traps, solitons exhibit a behavior different from those observed in anharmonic traps, where the dynamics is significantly influenced by the azimuthal index of the trap. The ability to control soliton dynamics in BECs holds significant promise for applications in quantum technologies, precision sensing, and the exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Lattice Bose polarons at strong coupling and quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical framework for exploring a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a highly correlated bath of bosons in the quantum critical regime of a Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) quantum phase transition. Our framework is based on a powerful quantum Gutzwiller (QGW) description of the bosonic bath combined with diagrammatic field theory for the impurity-bath interactions. By resumming a selected class of diagrams to infinite order, a rich picture emerges where the impurity is dressed by the fundamental modes of the bath, which change character from gapped particle-hole excitations in the MI to Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes in the SF. This gives rise to the existence of several quasiparticle (polaron) branches with properties reflecting the strongly correlated environment. In particular, one polaron branch exhibits a sharp cusp in its energy, while a new ground-state polaron emerges at the $O(2)$ quantum phase transition point for integer filling, which reflects the nonanalytic behavior at the transition and the appearance of the Goldstone mode in the SF phase. Smooth versions of these features are inherited in the polaron spectrum away from integer filling because of the varying ``Mottness" of the bosonic bath. We furthermore compare our diagrammatic results with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, obtaining excellent agreement. This accuracy is quite remarkable for such a highly non-trivial case of strong interactions between the impurity and bosons in a maximally correlated quantum critical regime, and it establishes the utility of our framework. Finally, our results show how impurities can be used as quantum sensors and highlight fundamental differences between experiments performed at a fixed particle number or a fixed chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Anti-thermalization: Heating by cooling and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common intuition tells us that if one part of a connected system is cooled continuously, the other parts should also cool down. This intuition can be given a microscopic foundation for the case of a generic quantum system coupled to a "lead" that is maintained at a given temperature. We show that by suppressing resonant energy exchange between the two parts, one can reverse the fate of the system, namely, it can heat up toward its most excited state as the lead is cooled to its ground state, and vice versa. This anti-thermal dynamics arises in a broad class of systems with a conserved $U(1)$ charge, and can be tested with two qubits in existing setups. We show that the mechanism allows one to prepare mid-spectrum nonclassical states, stable temperature gradients in closed systems, and highly athermal states where subspaces heat in the presence of overall cooling. Our findings highlight the critical role played by the nature of the coupling and reveal a rich interplay between symmetry and resonance effects in the dynamics of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Observation of pattern stabilization in a driven superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of patterns in driven systems has been studied extensively, and their emergence can be connected to a fine balance of instabilities and stabilization mechanisms. While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the long-time dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows towards such a stable fixed-point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed-point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Parametric tuning of quantum phase transitions in ultracold reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in atomic physics have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultra-cold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the constituent atoms and molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in non-adiabatic regimes.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Inverse Turbulent-Wave Cascade in a Driven Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate, we drive the gas isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size, and observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution. At lengthscales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we reveal the complete qualitative picture of how the steady-state cascade forms.</description>

      <title>Polaronic dressing of bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>
