      <title>Nontrivial entanglement passively mediated by a quenched magnetic impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of a Kondo system undergoing a transition to a state with a quenched magnetic impurity, using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We focus on a two-channel spin-1 Kondo impurity with single-ion anisotropy, where a quantum phase transition occurs between two topologically distinct local Fermi liquids. In the fully screened Kondo phase, realized at lower anisotropies, the entangled region surrounding the magnetic impurity mimics the Kondo screening cloud, although its length does not follow the conventional behavior. In contrast, beyond the transition, the system enters a non-Landau Fermi liquid phase with a markedly different entanglement structure: as the impurity is quenched and disentangled from the rest of the system due to the breakdown of the Kondo effect, the two conduction channels coupled only through the impurity develop a significant degree of entanglement with one another. Our findings demonstrate that a quenched magnetic impurity can passively and efficiently mediate entanglement between spatially separated conduction bands.</description>

      <title>Modulated honeycomb lattices and their magnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of modulated honeycomb lattices, a class of quasiperiodic tilings characterized by the metallic mean. These lattices consist of six distinct hexagonal prototiles with two edge lengths, $\ell$ and $s$, and can be regarded as a continuous deformation of the honeycomb lattice. The structural properties are examined through their substitution rules. To study the electronic properties, we construct a tight-binding model on the tilings, introducing two types of hopping integrals, $t_L$ and $t_S$, corresponding to the two edge lengths, $\ell$ and $s$, respectively. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian on these quasiperiodic tilings, we compute the corresponding density of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that the introduction of quasiperiodicity in the distribution of hopping integrals induces a spiky structure in the DOS at higher energies, while the linear DOS at low energies ($E\sim 0$) remains robust. This contrasts with the smooth DOS in the disordered tight-binding model, where two types of hopping integrals are randomly distributed according to a given ratio. Furthermore, we study the magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on modulated honeycomb lattices by means of real-space Hartree approximations. A magnetic phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength due to the absence of the noninteracting DOS at the Fermi level. When $t_L\sim t_S$, the phase transition point is primarily governed by the linear DOS. However, far from the condition $t_L=t_S$, the quasiperiodic structure plays a significant role in reducing the critical interaction strength, which is in contrast to the disordered system. Using perpendicular space analysis, we demonstrate that sublattice asymmetry inherent in the quasiperiodic tilings emerges in the magnetic profile, providing insights into the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at Fc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Photo-generated charge-transfer excitons in NiO revealed by ultrafast time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electronic correlation can lead to insulating behavior and to the opening of large optical gaps, even in materials with partly filled valence shells. Although the non-equilibrium optical response encodes both local (quasi atomic) and collective (long range) responses, optical spectroscopy is usually more sensitive to the latter. Resonant x-ray techniques are better suited to investigate the quasi-atomic properties of correlated solids. Using time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), here we study the ultrafast non-equilibrium processes in NiO following photo-excitation by ultraviolet photons with energy exceeding the optical gap. We observe the creation of charge-transfer excitons that decay with a time constant of about 2\,ps, while itinerant photo-doping persists for tens of picoseconds. Following our discovery, which establishes time-resolved high-resolution RIXS as a powerful tool for the study of transient phenomena in condensed matter, the possible presence of charge-transfer excitons will need to be considered when interpreting optical pump-probe experiments on correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Single Ion Anisotropy and Magnetic 3d-4f Interactions in V$^{\rm III}_2$Ln$^{\rm III}_2$ Butterfly Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of 3d-4f molecular magnets, the most thoroughly investigated architecture is that of butterfly-shaped coordination clusters as it provides an ideal testbed to study fundamental magnetic interactions. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of isostructural V$^{\rm III}_2$Ln$^{\rm III}_2$ butterfly complexes, where Ln = Y (1Y), Tb (2Tb), Dy (3Dy), Ho (4Ho), Er (5Er), Tm (6Tm), Yb (7Yb), which extends the previous study on isostructural butterflies with Cr$^{\rm III}$, Mn$^{\rm III}$ and Fe$^{\rm III}$. In zero external field, compounds 2Tb, 3Dy and 4Ho show clear maxima in the out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility whereas small magnetic fields are needed to suppress quantum tunneling in 6Tm. Combined high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetisation measurements unambiguously reveal an easy-plane anisotropy of the V$^{\rm III}$ ion and antiferromagnetic Ising-like 3d-4f exchange couplings. The strength of $J_{\rm 3d-4f}$ is shown to decrease upon variation of the 4f ion from Tb to Ho, while increasing antiferromagnetic interaction can be observed from Ho to Tm. The exact inverse chemical trend is found for the relative angle between the 3d and 4f main anisotropy axes, which highlights the important role of the lanthanide 4f electron distribution anisotropy for 3d-4f exchange.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Magnetophononics in Gapped Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One route to the control of quantum magnetism at ultrafast timescales is magnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by coherently driven lattice excitations. Theoretical studies of a gapped quantum magnet subject to continuous, single-frequency driving of one strongly coupled phonon mode find intriguing phenomena including mutually repelling phonon-bitriplon excitations and global renormalization of the spin excitation spectrum. Because experiments are performed with ultrashort pulses that contain a wide range of driving frequencies, we investigate phonon-bitriplon physics under pulsed laser driving. We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of the driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the phonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier transforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation between the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium collective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually repelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation that captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and difference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also leave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such magnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound CuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well characterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Universal Kerr effect in A-type antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description>

      <title>Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of the inverse Faraday effect in a multiorbital model: Role of orbital magnetic moment and electric dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment, in a multiorbital metallic system. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.</description>

      <title>Quantum weight: A fundamental property of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a ground state property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelengths. The quantum weight carries a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system, and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or low-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary conditions) can be determined directly from the quantum weight. Notably, the quantum weight is a property of a single ground state and independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding thus enables direct experimental measurement and numerical calculation of many-body quantum metric. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the quantum weight is distinct from the many-body quantum metric due to dielectric screening in three dimensions. We further use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on their quantum weight in terms of electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron loss spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice: from supersolid to gapped solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by numerically studying excitations and the dynamical spin structure factor $S^{\mu\mu}({\bf q},\omega)$. Results are analyzed within the supersolid scenario, characterized by the translation-symmetry-breaking parameter $m_z$ and the supersolid offdiagonal order parameter $m_\perp$. We find very robust $m_z &gt; 0$ in the whole easy-axis anisotropy regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z &gt; 0$, even enhanced by the magnetic field $h&gt;0$, as well as $m_\perp &gt;0$ for intermediate $\alpha &lt;1$ and $h&gt;0$. Still, at small $\alpha \lesssim 0.2$, relevant for recent experiments on the magnetic material K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, we find at $h=0$ rather vanishing $m_\perp \sim 0$, which appears compatible with the numerically established finite magnon excitation gap $\Delta_1 \sim 0.25 \alpha J$.</description>

      <title>The spin-orbital Kitaev model: from kagome spin ice to classical fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable spin-orbital model that can be regarded as a classical analogue of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb model and describes interactions between Rydberg atoms on the ruby lattice. We leverage its local and nonlocal symmetries to determine the exact partition function and the static structure factor. A mapping between $S=3/2$ models on the honeycomb lattice and kagome spin Hamiltonians allows us to interpret the thermodynamic properties in terms of a classical kagome spin ice. Partially lifting the symmetries associated with line operators, we obtain a model characterized by immobile excitations, called classical fractons, and a ground state degeneracy that increases exponentially with the length of the system. We formulate a continuum theory that reveals the underlying gauge structure and conserved charges. Extensions of our theory to other lattices and higher-spin systems are suggested.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liang Information Flow Probe of Causality across Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19364</link>

Abstract: Investigating causation in the quantum domain is crucial. Despite numerous studies of correlations in quantum many-body systems, causation, which is very distinct from correlations, has hardly been studied. We address this by demonstrating the efficacy of the newly established causation measure, quantum Liang information flow, in quantifying causality across phase diagrams of quantum many-body systems. We focus on quantum criticality, which are highly nonclassical points. We extract causation behavior across a spectrum-wide critical point and a ground state second-order phase transition in both integrable and nonintegrable systems. Across criticality, each case exhibits distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. We also deduce that quantum causation qualitatively follows the quasiparticle picture of information propagation in integrable systems but exhibits enhanced quantum nonlocality near criticality. At times significantly larger than the spatial separation, it extracts additional features from the equilibrium wave function, leading to a peak just before the critical point for near boundary sites.</description>

      <title>Monitored long-range interacting systems: spin-wave theory for quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phases exhibit unconventional dynamics as emergent collective phenomena, yet their behavior in tailored interacting systems -- crucial for quantum technologies -- remains less understood. We develop a systematic toolbox to analyze monitored dynamics in long-range interacting systems, relevant to platforms like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. Our method extends spin-wave theory to general dynamical generators at the quantum trajectory level, enabling access to a broader class of states than approaches based on density matrices. This allows efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins and captures nonlinear dynamical features such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring entanglement phase transitions in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions in one and two dimensions, where the entanglement scaling changes from logarithm to volume law as the interaction range shortens, and by dwelling on how our method mitigates experimental post-selection challenges in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum catalysts for transforming between phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A catalyst is a substance that enables otherwise impossible transformations between states of a system, without being consumed in the process. In this work, we apply the notion of catalysts to many-body quantum physics. In particular, we construct catalysts that enable transformations between different symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter using symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits. We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states which spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework which has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pure- and mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wave numbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <title>The First Principles Equation for Coherent Phonons: Dynamics and Polaron distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the first principles description of coherent phonons in systems subjected to optical excitations and/or doping. We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and dynamical Born effective charges. We demonstrate that nonadiabatic effects renormalize the Born-Oppenheimer frequencies and introduce a damping term responsible for the finite lifetime of coherent phonons. Notably, both the frequency renormalization and the lifetime are identical to those of quantum phonons. Furthermore, we show that electrons exert a force driven by an unconventional dynamically screened electron-phonon coupling. This coupling is smaller than the bare one even in the adiabatic limit, highlighting the need to revise current models. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory that describes lattice distortions induced by doping.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of RP nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a "bilayer-trilayer" stacking sequence.</description>
