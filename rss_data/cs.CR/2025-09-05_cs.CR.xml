      <title>Reactive Bottom-Up Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects, where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security practices.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Genetic Algorithm-Enhanced Self-Supervised Intrusion Detection System for Wireless Sensor Networks in the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has significantly increased the attack surface of such systems, making them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of resource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and reliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages quantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and fine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in resource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust representations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually labeled training sets. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT intrusion datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency compared to conventional evolutionary and deep learning-based IDS models. The results highlight the potential of combining quantum-inspired optimization with self-supervised paradigms to design next-generation intrusion detection solutions for IoT and WSN environments.</description>

      <title>Peekaboo, I See Your Queries: Passive Attacks Against DSSE Via Intermittent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) allows secure searches over a dynamic encrypted database but suffers from inherent information leakage. Existing passive attacks against DSSE rely on persistent leakage monitoring to infer leakage patterns, whereas this work targets intermittent observation - a more practical threat model. We propose Peekaboo - a new universal attack framework - and the core design relies on inferring the search pattern and further combining it with auxiliary knowledge and other leakage. We instantiate Peekaboo over the SOTA attacks, Sap (USENIX' 21) and Jigsaw (USENIX' 24), to derive their "+" variants (Sap+ and Jigsaw+). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design achieves &gt;0.9 adjusted rand index for search pattern recovery and 90% query accuracy vs. FMA's 30% (CCS' 23). Peekaboo's accuracy scales with observation rounds and the number of observed queries but also it resists SOTA countermeasures, with &gt;40% accuracy against file size padding and &gt;80% against obfuscation.</description>

      <title>BIDO: A Unified Approach to Address Obfuscation and Concept Drift Challenges in Image-based Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability. Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift. However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns. Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and obfuscation.

      <title>Rethinking Tamper-Evident Logging: A High-Performance, Co-Designed Auditing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing tamper-evident logging systems suffer from high overhead and severe data loss in high-load settings, yet only provide coarse-grained tamper detection. Moreover, installing such systems requires recompiling kernel code. To address these challenges, we present Nitro, a high-performance, tamper-evident audit logging system that supports fine-grained detection of log tampering. Even better, our system avoids kernel recompilation by using the eBPF technology. To formally justify the security of Nitro, we provide a new definitional framework for logging systems, and give a practical cryptographic construction meeting this new goal. Unlike prior work that focus only on the cryptographic processing, we codesign the cryptographic part with the pre- and post-processing of the logs to exploit all system-level optimizations. Our evaluations demonstrate Nitro's superior performance, achieving 10X-25X improvements in high-stress conditions and 2X-10X in real-world scenarios while maintaining near-zero data loss. We also provide an advanced variant, Nitro-R that introduces in-kernel log reduction techniques to reduce runtime overhead even further.</description>

      <title>KGBERT4Eth: A Feature-Complete Transformer Powered by Knowledge Graph for Multi-Task Ethereum Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethereum's rapid ecosystem expansion and transaction anonymity have triggered a surge in malicious activity. Detection mechanisms currently bifurcate into three technical strands: expert-defined features, graph embeddings, and sequential transaction patterns, collectively spanning the complete feature sets of Ethereum's native data layer. Yet the absence of cross-paradigm integration mechanisms forces practitioners to choose between sacrificing sequential context awareness, structured fund-flow patterns, or human-curated feature insights in their solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose KGBERT4Eth, a feature-complete pre-training encoder that synergistically combines two key components: (1) a Transaction Semantic Extractor, where we train an enhanced Transaction Language Model (TLM) to learn contextual semantic representations from conceptualized transaction records, and (2) a Transaction Knowledge Graph (TKG) that incorporates expert-curated domain knowledge into graph node embeddings to capture fund flow patterns and human-curated feature insights. We jointly optimize pre-training objectives for both components to fuse these complementary features, generating feature-complete embeddings. To emphasize rare anomalous transactions, we design a biased masking prediction task for TLM to focus on statistical outliers, while the Transaction TKG employs link prediction to learn latent transaction relationships and aggregate knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a mask-invariant attention coordination module to ensure stable dynamic information exchange between TLM and TKG during pre-training. KGBERT4Eth significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks, achieving absolute F1-score improvements of 8-16% on three phishing detection benchmarks and 6-26% on four de-anonymization datasets.</description>

      <title>ShieldMMU: Detecting and Defending against Controlled-Channel Attacks in Shielding Memory System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intel SGX and hypervisors isolate non-privileged programs from other software, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. However, side-channel attacks continue to threaten Intel SGX's security, enabling malicious OS to manipulate PTE present bits, induce page faults, and steal memory access traces. Despite extensive research, existing defenses focus on detection or rely on impractical solutions. This paper presents ShieldMMU, a comprehensive solution for mitigating controlled channel attacks, balancing compatibility, performance, and usability. Leveraging a Merkle Tree-inspired Defense Tree (DD-Tree), ShieldMMU protects PTE integrity by detecting, locating, and restoring attacked PTEs. It identifies MMU page table lookup events and side-channel attacks, promptly restoring PTE parameters to prevent page fault traps and ensure secure non-privileged application operation within SGX. Our experiments confirm ShieldMMU's enhanced security and acceptable latency performance.</description>

      <title>LMAE4Eth: Generalizable and Robust Ethereum Fraud Detection by Exploring Transaction Semantics and Masked Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets.</description>

      <title>NeuroBreak: Unveil Internal Jailbreak Mechanisms in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis of NIST PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance to timing leakage is therefore an essential property, and achieving this typically relies on software implementations that follow constant-time principles. Moreover, ensuring that all implementations are constant-time is crucial for fair performance comparisons, as secure implementations often incur additional overhead. Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that are inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time properties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze the compiled binary directly. Since manual binary analysis is extremely challenging, automated analysis becomes highly important. Although several tools exist to assist with such analysis, they often have usability limitations and are difficult to set up correctly. To support the developers besides the NIST committee in verifying candidates, we developed a toolchain that automates configuration, execution, and result analysis for several widely used constant-time analysis tools. We selected TIMECOP and Binsec/Rel2 to verify constant-time policy compliance at the binary level, and dudect and RTLF to detect side-channel vulnerabilities through statistical analysis of execution time behavior. We demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability by evaluating the NIST PQDSS round 1 and round 2 implementations. We reported 26 issues in total to the respective developers, and 5 of them have already been fixed. We also discuss our different findings, as well as the benefits of shortcomings of the different tools.</description>

      <title>Error Detection Schemes for Barrett Reduction of CT-BU on FPGA in Post Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection. While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is nearly 100%.</description>

      <title>ICSLure: A Very High Interaction Honeynet for PLC-based Industrial Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) is critical to ensuring the safety of industrial processes and personnel. The rapid adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies has expanded system functionality but also increased the attack surface, exposing ICSs to a growing range of cyber threats. Honeypots provide a means to detect and analyze such threats by emulating target systems and capturing attacker behavior. However, traditional ICS honeypots, often limited to software-based simulations of a single Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), lack the realism required to engage sophisticated adversaries. In this work, we introduce a modular honeynet framework named ICSLure. The framework has been designed to emulate realistic ICS environments. Our approach integrates physical PLCs interacting with live data sources via industrial protocols such as Modbus and Profinet RTU, along with virtualized network components including routers, switches, and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs). The system incorporates comprehensive monitoring capabilities to collect detailed logs of attacker interactions. We demonstrate that our framework enables coherent and high-fidelity emulation of real-world industrial plants. This high-interaction environment significantly enhances the quality of threat data collected and supports advanced analysis of ICS-specific attack strategies, contributing to more effective detection and mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Third-Party Library Detection: A Ground Truth Dataset and Its Implications Across Security Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection of third-party libraries (TPLs) is fundamental to Android security, supporting vulnerability tracking, malware detection, and supply chain auditing. Despite many proposed tools, their real-world effectiveness remains unclear.We present the first large-scale empirical study of ten state-of-the-art TPL detection techniques across over 6,000 apps, enabled by a new ground truth dataset with precise version-level annotations for both remote and local dependencies.Our evaluation exposes tool fragility to R8-era transformations, weak version discrimination, inaccurate correspondence of candidate libraries, difficulty in generalizing similarity thresholds, and prohibitive runtime/memory overheads at scale.Beyond tool assessment, we further analyze how TPLs shape downstream tasks, including vulnerability analysis, malware detection, secret leakage assessment, and LLM-based evaluation. From this perspective, our study provides concrete insights into how TPL characteristics affect these tasks and informs future improvements in security analysis.</description>

Abstract: Whilst many key exchange and digital signature systems still rely on NIST P-256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1, offering around 128-bit security, there is an increasing demand for transparent and reproducible curves at the 256-bit security level. Standard higher-security options include NIST P-521, Curve448, and Brainpool-P512. This paper presents ECCFROG522PP ("Presunto Powered"), a 522-bit prime-field elliptic curve that delivers security in the same classical approx 260-bit ballpark as NIST P-521, but with a fundamentally different design philosophy. All of the curve parameters are deterministically derived from a fixed public seed via BLAKE3, with zero hidden choices. The curve has prime order (cofactor = 1), a verified twist with a proven approx 505-bit prime factor, safe embedding degree (greater than or equal to 14), and passes anti-MOV checks up to k less than or equal to 200 and CM discriminant sanity up to 100k. Unlike prior opaque or ad-hoc constructions, ECCFROG522PP is fully reproducible: anyone can regenerate and verify it byte-for-byte using the published scripts. The intent is not to outperform NIST P-521 in raw speed, but to maximise trust, verifiability, and long-term auditability in a practical curve of equivalent security level</description>

      <title>KubeGuard: LLM-Assisted Kubernetes Hardening via Configuration Files and Runtime Logs Analysis</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</description>

      <title>An Automated, Scalable Machine Learning Model Inversion Assessment Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&amp;E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&amp;E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&amp;E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&amp;E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&amp;E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile money in Uganda has been a cornerstone of financial inclusion, yet its security mechanisms remain a critical concern. This study investigates a significant public response to perceived security failures: the #StopAirtelThefty Twitter campaign of August 2025 Sparked by an incident publicized by Dr. Jim Spire Ssentongo where a phone thief accessed a victim's account, withdrew funds, and procured a loan, the campaign revealed deep seated public anxiety over the safety of mobile money. This research employs qualitative analysis to systematically examine the complaints raised during this campaign, extracting key themes related to security vulnerabilities and user dissatisfaction. By synthesizing these public sentiments, the paper provides crucial insights into the specific security gaps experienced by users and situates these findings within the larger framework of Uganda's mobile money regulatory and operational environment. The study concludes with implications for providers, policymakers, and the future of secure digital finance in Uganda.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

      <title>The Auth Shim: A Lightweight Architectural Pattern for Integrating Enterprise SSO with Standalone Open-Source Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC, creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components, interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Vulnerabilities in Python Packages and Their Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern, highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul, the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities. PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities, each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy, achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy to Clear: Elucidating the Threat Hunter Cognitive Process and Cognitive Support Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With security threats increasing in frequency and severity, it is critical that we consider the important role of threat hunters. These highly-trained security professionals learn to see, identify, and intercept security threats. Many recent works and existing tools in cybersecurity are focused on automating the threat hunting process, often overlooking the critical human element. Our study shifts this paradigm by emphasizing a human-centered approach to understanding the lived experiences of threat hunters. By observing threat hunters during hunting sessions and analyzing the rich insights they provide, we seek to advance the understanding of their cognitive processes and the tool support they need. Through an in-depth observational study of threat hunters, we introduce a model of how they build and refine their mental models during threat hunting sessions. We also present 23 themes that provide a foundation to better understand threat hunter needs and suggest five actionable design propositions to enhance the tools that support them. Through these contributions, our work enriches the theoretical understanding of threat hunting and provides practical insights for designing more effective, human-centered cybersecurity tools.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions often rely on opaque, black-box models. While these models may achieve high performance, their outputs are usually difficult to interpret and adapt, making it challenging to capture nuanced behavioral patterns. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these gaps, but their capabilities in this area remain largely unexplored, particularly in cybercrime detection. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, with a focus on Bitcoin, one of the most studied and widely adopted blockchain networks. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced transaction graph sampling algorithm, CETraS. Together, they significantly reduce token requirements, transforming the analysis of multiple moderately large-scale transaction graphs with LLMs from nearly impossible to feasible under strict token limits. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have outstanding performance on foundational metrics and characteristic overview, where the accuracy of recognizing most basic information at the node level exceeds 98.50% and the proportion of obtaining meaningful characteristics reaches 95.00%. Regarding contextual interpretation, LLMs also demonstrate strong performance in classification tasks, even with very limited labeled data, where top-3 accuracy reaches 72.43% with explanations. While the explanations are not always fully accurate, they highlight the strong potential of LLMs in this domain. At the same time, several limitations persist, which we discuss along with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>LADSG: Label-Anonymized Distillation and Similar Gradient Substitution for Label Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training across distributed feature spaces, which enables privacy-preserving learning without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have confirmed the feasibility of label inference attacks by internal adversaries. By strategically exploiting gradient vectors and semantic embeddings, attackers-through passive, active, or direct attacks-can accurately reconstruct private labels, leading to catastrophic data leakage. Existing defenses, which typically address isolated leakage vectors or are designed for specific types of attacks, remain vulnerable to emerging hybrid attacks that exploit multiple pathways simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified and lightweight defense framework for VFL. LADSG first anonymizes true labels via soft distillation to reduce semantic exposure, then generates semantically-aligned substitute gradients to disrupt gradient-based leakage, and finally filters anomalous updates through gradient norm detection. It is scalable and compatible with standard VFL pipelines. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG reduces the success rates of all three types of label inference attacks by 30-60% with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear arms control treaties have historically focused on strategic nuclear delivery systems, indirectly restricting strategic nuclear warhead numbers and leaving nonstrategic nuclear warheads (NSNWs) outside formal verification frameworks. This paper presents a cryptographic protocol for secure and verifiable warhead tracking, addressing challenges in nuclear warhead verification without requiring intrusive physical inspections. Our system leverages commitment schemes and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zkSNARKs) to ensure compliance with treaty constraints while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive nuclear warhead data. We propose a cryptographic "Warhead Passport" tracking system that chains commitments to individual warheads over their life cycle, enabling periodic challenges and real-time verification of treaty compliance. Our implementation follows real-world treaty constraints, integrates U.S. and Russian dual-hash combiners (SHA-family and GOST R 34.11 family) for cryptographic robustness and political constraints, and ensures forward security by preventing retroactive data manipulation. This work builds on policy research from prior arms control studies and provides a practical foundation for implementing secure, auditable NSNW verification mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SoK: Root Cause of $1 Billion Loss in Smart Contract Real-World Attacks via a Systematic Literature Review of Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While catastrophic attacks on Ethereum persist, vulnerability research remains fixated on implementation-level smart contract bugs, creating a gap between academic understanding of vulnerabilities and the root causes of high-impact, real-world incidents. To address this, we employ a two-pronged methodology: first, a systematic literature review of 71 academic papers to build a catalog of 24 active and 5 deprecated vulnerabilities. Second, we conduct an in-depth, empirical analysis of 50 of the most severe real-world attacks between 2022 and 2025, collectively incurring over $1.09B in losses, to identify their root causes. We introduce the concept of "exploit chains" by revealing that many incidents are not caused by isolated vulnerabilities but by combinations of human, operational, and economic design flaws that link with implementation bugs to enable an attack. Our analysis yields insights on how decentralized applications are exploited in practice, leading to a novel, four-tier root-cause framework that moves beyond code-level vulnerabilities. We find that real-world successful attacks on Ethereum (and related networks) trace back to one of the four tiers of (1) protocol logic design, (2) lifecycle and governance, (3) external dependencies, and (4) classic smart contract vulnerabilities. We investigate the suitability of this multi-tier incident root-cause framework via a case study.</description>

      <title>ShadowScope: GPU Monitoring and Validation via Composable Side Channel Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern systems increasingly rely on GPUs for computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning acceleration, ensuring the integrity of GPU computation has become critically important. Recent studies have shown that GPU kernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer attacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable through side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation approaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to interference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse scheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a monitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model. Instead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes trusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key behavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at finer granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise, workload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce reliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a hardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip checks into the GPU pipeline. ShadowScope+ achieves high validation accuracy with an average runtime overhead of just 4.6%, while incurring minimal hardware and design complexity. Together, these contributions demonstrate that side-channel observability can be systematically repurposed into a practical defense for GPU kernel integrity.</description>

      <title>From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Graph Structural Learning Beyond Homophily via Preserving Neighbor Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of graph-based learning systems in handling structural data, it has been widely investigated that they are fragile to adversarial attacks on homophilic graph data, where adversaries maliciously modify the semantic and topology information of the raw graph data to degrade the predictive performances. Motivated by this, a series of robust models are crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of graph-based learning systems on homophilic graphs. However, the security of graph-based learning systems on heterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we start to explore the vulnerability of graph-based learning systems regardless of the homophily degree, and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification loss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the powered aggregated neighbor features. The theoretical finding inspires us to craft a novel robust graph structural learning strategy that serves as a useful graph mining module in a robust model that incorporates a dual-kNN graph constructions pipeline to supervise the neighbor-similarity-preserved propagation, where the graph convolutional layer adaptively smooths or discriminates the features of node pairs according to their affluent local structures. In this way, the proposed methods can mine the ``better" topology of the raw graph data under diverse graph homophily and achieve more reliable data management on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</description>

      <title>Exposing Synthetic Speech: Model Attribution and Detection of AI-generated Speech via Audio Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As speech generation technologies continue to advance in quality and accessibility, the risk of malicious use cases, including impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing, increases rapidly. This work addresses this threat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for detecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model. Specifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample was generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access only to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known pool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus real speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the difference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either a low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these residuals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis systems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution. Across extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99% in most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real speech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems. In addition, our robustness analysis underscores the method's ability to maintain high performance even in the presence of moderate additive noise. Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong generalization across speech synthesis systems and languages, this technique offers a practical tool for digital forensics and security applications.</description>

      <title>Defending LVLMs Against Vision Attacks through Partial-Perception Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have raised significant concerns regarding the vulnerability of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to maliciously injected or perturbed input images, which can mislead their responses. Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models.</description>

      <title>KNighter: Transforming Static Analysis with LLM-Synthesized Checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.
  We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent bugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and 30 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</description>

      <title>Generalized and Unified Equivalences between Hardness and Pseudoentropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability (known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009) and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.</description>
