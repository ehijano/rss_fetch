      <title>Improving precision of A/B experiments using trigger intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industry, online randomized controlled experiment (a.k.a A/B experiment) is a standard approach to measure the impact of a causal change. These experiments have small treatment effect to reduce the potential blast radius. As a result, these experiments often lack statistical significance due to low signal-to-noise ratio. To improve the precision (or reduce standard error), we introduce the idea of trigger observations where the output of the treatment and the control model are different. We show that the evaluation with full information about trigger observations (full knowledge) improves the precision in comparison to a baseline method. However, detecting all such trigger observations is a costly affair, hence we propose a sampling based evaluation method (partial knowledge) to reduce the cost. The randomness of sampling introduces bias in the estimated outcome. We theoretically analyze this bias and show that the bias is inversely proportional to the number of observations used for sampling. We also compare the proposed evaluation methods using simulation and empirical data. In simulation, evaluation with full knowledge reduces the standard error as much as 85%. In empirical setup, evaluation with partial knowledge reduces the standard error by 36.48%.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference in General Bunching Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal econometric framework and tools for the identification and inference of a structural parameter in general bunching designs. We present both point and partial identification results, which generalize previous approaches in the literature. The key assumption for point identification is the analyticity of the counterfactual density, which defines a broader class of distributions than many well-known parametric families. In the partial identification approach, the analyticity condition is relaxed and various shape restrictions can be incorporated, including those found in the literature. Both of our identification results account for observable heterogeneity in the model, which has previously been permitted only in limited ways. We provide a suite of counterfactual estimation and inference methods, termed the generalized polynomial strategy. Our method restores the merits of the original polynomial strategy proposed by Chetty et al. (2011) while addressing several weaknesses in the widespread practice. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated compared to a version of the polynomial estimator in a series of Monte Carlo studies within the augmented isoelastic model. We revisit the data used in Saez (2010) and find substantially different results relative to those from the polynomial strategy.</description>
