      <title>A simple mathematical theory for Simple Volatile Memristors and their spiking circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of neuromorphic (brain-inspired) devices, memristors (memory-resistors) have emerged as promising candidates for emulating neuronal circuitry. Here we mathematically define a class of Simple Volatile Memristors (SVMs), which notably includes various fluidic iontronic devices that have recently garnered significant interest due to their unique quality of operating within the same medium as the brain. We show that symmetric SVMs produce non self-crossing current-voltage hysteresis loops, while simple asymmetric SVMs produce self-crossing loops. Additionally, we derive a general expression for the enclosed area in a loop, providing a relation between the voltage frequency and the SVM memory timescale. These general results are shown to materialise in physical finite-element calculations of microfluidic memristors. An SVM-based circuit has been proposed that exhibits all-or-none and tonic neuronal spiking. We generalise and analyse this spiking circuit, characterising it as a two-dimensional dynamical system. Additionally, we demonstrate that stochastic effects can induce novel neuronal firing modes absent in the deterministic case. Through our analysis, the circuit dynamics are well understood, while retaining its explicit link with the physically plausible underlying system.</description>

      <title>Hydroxide Transport and Mechanical Properties of Polyolefin-Based Anion Exchange Membranes from Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anion exchange membranes are used in alkaline fuel cells and offer a promising alternative to the more expensive proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, hydroxide ion conductivity in anion exchange membranes is low, and the quest for membranes with superior ion conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability is ongoing. In this study, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to study hydroxide ion transport and mechanical properties of eight different hydrated polyolefin-based membranes, to provide a molecular-level understanding of the structure-function relationships in these systems. We examine the microstructure of the membranes and find that polymers with narrow cavity size distribution have tighter packing of water molecules around hydroxide ions. We estimate the self-diffusion coefficient of water and hydroxide ions and find that water molecules have a higher diffusion than hydroxide ions across all systems. The trends in hydroxide diffusion align well with experimental conductivity measurements. Water facilitates hydroxide diffusion, and this is clearly observed when the hydration level is varied for the same polymer chemistry. In systems with narrow cavities and tightly bound hydroxide ions, hydroxide diffusion is the lowest, underscoring the fact that water channels facilitate hydroxide transport. Finally, we apply uniaxial deformation to calculate the mechanical properties of these systems and find that polymers with higher hydration levels show poor mechanical properties. Atomistic molecular dynamics models can accurately capture the trade-off between hydroxide transport and mechanical performance in anion exchange membranes and allow us to screen new candidates more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Active doping controls the mode of failure in dense colloidal gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical properties of disordered materials are governed by their underlying free energy landscape. In contrast to external fields, embedding a small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates non-equilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the 'swim force' generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find, and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of attractive forces among gel particles. Below the critical swim force, the ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder. Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a non-monotonic trend of ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.</description>

      <title>A water structure indicator suitable for generic contexts: two-liquid behavior at hydration and nanoconfinement conditions and a molecular approach to hydrophobicity and wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work we have briefly introduced a new structural index for water that, unlike previous indicators, was devised specifically for generic contexts beyond bulk conditions, making it suitable for hydration and nanoconfinement settings. In this work we shall study this metric in detail, demonstrating its ability to reveal the existence of a fine-tuned interplay between local structure and energetics in liquid water. This molecular principle enables the establishment of an extended hydrogen bond network, while simultaneously allowing for the existence of network defects by compensating for uncoordinated sites. By studying different water models and different temperatures encompassing both the normal liquid and the supercooled regime, this molecular mechanism will be shown to underlie the two-state behavior of bulk water. Additionally, by studying functionalized self-assembled monolayers and diverse graphene-like surfaces, we shall show that this principle is also operative at hydration and nanoconfinement conditions, thus generalizing the validity of the two-liquids scenario of water to these contexts. This approach will allow us to define conditions for wettability, providing an accurate measure of hydrophobicity and a reliable predictor of filling and drying transitions. Hence, it might open the possibility of elucidating the active role of water in broad fields of biophysics and materials science. As a preliminary step, we shall study the hydration structure and hydrophilicity of graphene-like systems (parallel graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes) as a function of the confinement dimensionality.

      <title>The Cellular Potts Model on Disordered Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cellular Potts model, also known as Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model, is a lattice-based approach, by which biological tissues at the level of individual cells can be numerically studied. Traditionally, a square or hexagonal underlying lattice structure is assumed for two-dimensional systems and this is known to introduce artifacts in the structure and dynamics of the model tissues. Here, we developed a new variant of this method that can be applied to a broad class of (ir)regular lattices. We show that on an irregular lattice, deriving from a fluid-like configuration, two types of artifacts can be removed. We further report on the transition between a fluid-like disordered and a solid-like hexagonally ordered phase present for monodisperse confluent cells as a function of their surface tension. This transition shows the hallmarks of a first-order phase transition, and is different from the glass/jamming transitions commonly reported for the vertex and Voronoi models. We emphasize this by analyzing the distribution of shape parameters found in our state space. Our analysis provides a useful reference for the future study of epithelia using the (ir)regular Cellular Potts model.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g., crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Cleavable Bond-Modified Polyethylene for Circular Polymer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is considerable interest in designing new polymeric materials with built-in mechanisms for recycling. In this work, we present a systematic exploration of several polyethylene-based polymers that contain strategically incorporated cleavable bonds that are susceptible to chemical degradation. We consider ten distinct telechelic functionalities across varying chain lengths: ester, aromatic ester, anhydride, carbonate, urethane, siloxane, oxalate, acetal, urea, and amide linkages. Our study is focused on the effects of cleavable bonds on density, diffusion, enthalpy, and melting temperatures. We also examine the crystallization process. These are key properties for polymer processing and, by comparing them to those of linear polyethylene, we establish a platform that will help guide future synthetic efforts towards the design of sustainable plastics with performance comparable to that of traditional, high-performance polyolefin-based materials.</description>

      <title>Shape equilibria of vesicles with rigid planar inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of two-phase lipid vesicles possessing 2D solid domains integrated within a fluid bilayer phase, we study the shape equilibria of closed vesicles possessing a single planar, circular inclusion. While 2D solid elasticity tends to expel Gaussian curvature, topology requires closed vesicles to maintain an average, non-zero Gaussian curvature leading to an elementary mechanism of shape frustration that increases with inclusion size. We study elastic ground states of the Helfrich model of the planar-fluid composite vesicles, analytically and computationally, as a function of planar fraction and reduced volume. Notably, we show that incorporation of a planar inclusion of only a few percent dramatically shifts the ground state shapes of vesicles from predominantly {\it prolate} to {\it oblate}, and moreover, shifts the optimal surface to volume ratio far from spherical shapes. We show that for sufficiently small planar inclusions, the elastic ground states break symmetry via a complex variety of asymmetric oblate, prolate, and triaxial shapes, while inclusion sizes above about $8\%$ drive composite vesicles to adopt axisymmetric oblate shapes. These predictions cast useful light on the emergent shape and mechanical responses of fluid-solid composite vesicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloids dispersed in nematic liquid crystals form topological composites in which colloid-associated defects mediate interactions while adhering to fundamental topological constraints. Better realising the promise of such materials requires numerical methods that model nematic inclusions in dynamic and complex scenarios. We employ a mesoscale approach for simulating colloids as mobile surfaces embedded in a fluctuating nematohydrodynamic medium to study the kinetics of colloidal entanglement. In addition to reproducing far-field interactions, topological properties of disclination loops are resolved to reveal their metastable states and topological transitions during relaxation towards ground state. The intrinsic hydrodynamic fluctuations distinguish formerly unexplored far-from-equilibrium disclination states, including configurations with localised positive winding profiles. The adaptability and precision of this numerical approach offers promising avenues for studying the dynamics of colloids and topological defects in designed and out-of-equilibrium situations.</description>

      <title>Dispersionless Flat Mode and Vibrational Anomaly in Active Brownian Vibrators Induced by String-like Dynamical Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, active Brownian particles have emerged as a prominent model system for comprehending the behaviors of active matter, wherein particles demonstrate self-propelled motion by harnessing energy from the surrounding environment. A fundamental objective of studying active matter is to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying its collective behaviors. Drawing inspiration from advancements in molecular glasses, our study unveils a low-energy ``flat mode" within the transverse spectrum of active Brownian vibrators -- a nearly two-dimensional, bi-disperse granular assembly. We demonstrate that this collective excitation induces an anomalous excess in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) beyond the phononic Debye contribution. Additionally, we establish through empirical evidence that string-like dynamical defects, discerned via the spatial distribution of each particle's contribution to the reduced transverse VDOS, serve as the microscopic origin of the flat mode and its associated anomalies. These findings underscore the pivotal role of string-like dynamical defects in elucidating the vibrational and mechanical properties of active Brownian particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and transport properties of polymeric materials are essential for the design of reactors and for the development of polymer deconstruction processes. Existing property prediction tools such as correlations based on entropy scaling, kinetic gas theory, and free-volume model are inadequate for polymers. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven model for polyolefins based on data from molecular dynamics simulations that can accurately predict the transport properties of polyethylenes and their binary mixtures with higher n-alkanes across a range of temperatures, pressures, concentrations, and oligomer molecular weights.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of active string fluids and gels formed by dipolar active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles possessing permanent magnetic dipole moments occur naturally in magnetotactic bacteria and in man-made systems like active colloids or micro-robots. Yet, understanding the interplay between self-propulsion and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on dynamic self-assembly in three dimensions (3D) remains poorly understood. We conduct Brownian dynamics simulations on active dipolar particles in 3D, focusing on the low-density regime, where dipolar hard spheres tend to form chain-like aggregates and percolated networks with increasing dipolar coupling strength. Strong active forces override dipolar attractions, effectively inhibiting chain-like aggregation and network formation. Conversely, activating particles with low to moderate forces yields an active fluid consisting of chains and rings and an active gel with increasing dipolar coupling strength. Although the overall structure of an active gel remains interconnected, the network experiences more frequent configurational rearrangements due to the reduced bond lifetime of active dipolar particles. Consequently, particles exhibit enhanced translational and rotational diffusion within active fluid of strings and active gels compared to their passive counterparts. We quantify the influence of activity on aggregates topology, observing a transition from branched structures to unconnected chains and rings. Our findings are summarized in a state diagram, delineating the impact of dipolar coupling strength and active force magnitude on the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a fluid-like to a solid-like response by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging fluid state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalise this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high compared to shear, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flows as an enhanced sampling method for atomistic supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flows can transform a simple prior probability distribution into a more complex target distribution. Here, we evaluate the ability and efficiency of generative machine learning methods to sample the Boltzmann distribution of an atomistic model for glass-forming liquids. This is a notoriously difficult task, as it amounts to ergodically exploring the complex free energy landscape of a disordered and frustrated many-body system. We optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. Our study highlights the potential of generative machine learning models in scientific computing for complex systems, but also points to some of its current limitations and the need for further improvement.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have showcased its potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of new materials. Central to this progress is the development of rapidly computable property predictors, enabling the identification of novel materials with desired properties from vast material spaces. However, the limited availability of data resources poses a significant challenge in data-driven materials research, particularly hindering the exploration of innovative materials beyond the boundaries of existing data. While machine learning predictors are inherently interpolative, establishing a general methodology to create an extrapolative predictor remains a fundamental challenge, limiting the search for innovative materials beyond existing data boundaries. In this study, we leverage an attention-based architecture of neural networks and meta-learning algorithms to acquire extrapolative generalization capability. The meta-learners, experienced repeatedly with arbitrarily generated extrapolative tasks, can acquire outstanding generalization capability in unexplored material spaces. Through the tasks of predicting the physical properties of polymeric materials and hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites, we highlight the potential of such extrapolatively trained models, particularly with their ability to rapidly adapt to unseen material domains in transfer learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable total reflection of light by oblique helicoidal cholesteric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oblique helicoidal state of a cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH) is capable of continuous change of the pitch P in response to an applied electric field. Such a structure reflects 50% of the unpolarized light incident along the ChOH axis in the electrically tunable band determined by P/2. Here we demonstrate that at an oblique incidence of light, ChOH reflects 100% of light of any polarization. This singlet band of total reflection is associated with the full pitch P. We also describe the satellite P/2, P/3, and P/4 bands. The P/2 and P/4 bands are triplets while P/3 band is a singlet caused by multiple scatterings at P and P/2. A single ChOH cell acted upon by an electric field tunes all these bands in a very broad spectral range, from ultraviolet to infrared and beyond, thus representing a structural color device with enormous potential for optical and photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: Transport theory describes the response of a macroscopic current to a thermodynamic force, thus producing entropy and apparently violating time-reversal symmetry. In this note I report a pedagogical derivation of the Green-Kubo formula for transport coefficients that highlights the intrinsically dynamical nature of this formula and showcases the relation between the apparent breach of time-reversal symmetry and the non-commutativity of the low-frequency / low-wavevector limits of the conserved-density susceptibilities, from which the formula can be established.</description>

      <title>Impact of chirality on active Brownian particle: Exact moments in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of chirality, accounting for translational diffusion, on active Brownian particles in two and three dimensions. Despite the inherent complexity in solving the Fokker-Planck equation, we demonstrate a Laplace transform method for precisely calculating the temporal evolution of various dynamic moments. Our analysis yields explicit expressions for multiple moments, such as the second and fourth moments of displacement, revealing the impact of persistence and chirality. These moments exhibit oscillatory behaviour, and excess kurtosis indicates deviations from the Gaussian distribution during intermediate time intervals.</description>

      <title>Molecular modelling of odd viscoelastic fluids</title>

Abstract: We consider an active, stochastic microscopic model of particles suspended in a fluid and show that the coarse-grained description of this model renders odd viscoelasticity. The particles are odd dumbbells, each featuring a robotic device as the bead, which exhibits a particular torque response. We show that this model can be macroscopically treated as a viscoelastic fluid, analytically calculate the coefficients of the corresponding viscoelastic model, and corroborate the results using molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a unified analytical framework for several experimental and numerical setups designed to elucidate odd effects in fluids.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Free-Energy Functionals with Pair-Correlation Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical density functional theory (cDFT), is at best only known approximately for 3D systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a quasi-exact neural-network approximation of this functional by exclusively training on a dataset of radial distribution functions, circumventing the need to sample costly heterogeneous density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials. For a supercritical 3D Lennard-Jones system, we demonstrate that the learned neural free-energy functional accurately predicts planar inhomogeneous density profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations.</description>

      <title>Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stressess generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic vortex flows. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various organelles in a cell. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We found that the director dynamics is frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with the distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually as the randomness is increased, and develops a logarithmic spatial correlation for strong disorder. The threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes is specified and its dependence on the activity parameter is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Volume of Healthy Red Blood Cells is Optimal for Advective Oxygen Transport in Arterioles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are vital for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues through the intricate circulatory system. They achieve this by binding and releasing oxygen molecules to the abundant hemoglobin within their cytosol. The volume of RBCs affects the amount of oxygen they can carry, yet whether this volume is optimal for transporting oxygen through the circulatory system remains an open question. This study explores, through high-fidelity numerical simulations, the impact of RBC volume on advectve oxygen transport efficiency through arterioles which form the area of greatest flow resistance in the circulatory system. The results show that, strikingly, RBCs with volumes similar to those found in vivo are most efficient to transport oxygen through arterioles. The flow resistance is related to the cell-free layer thickness, which is influenced by the shape and the motion of the RBCs: at low volumes RBCs deform and fold while at high volumes RBCs collide and follow more diffuse trajectories. In contrast, RBCs with a healthy volume maximize the cell-free layer thickness, resulting in a more efficient advectve transport of oxygen.</description>

      <title>Mimicking quantum self-propulsion creates a generic route to quantum active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for describing quantum active matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that is of pure quantum origin. These quantum-active features are most clearly revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short time scales, that are intricately dependent on the geometry of the trapping potential.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Transport Barriers with Swimming Microorganisms in Chaotic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of bacterial activity on the mixing and transport properties of a passive scalar in time-periodic flows in experiments and in a simple model. We focus on the interactions between swimming E. coli and the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) of the flow, which are computed from experimentally measured velocity fields. Experiments show that such interactions are non-trivial and can lead to transport barriers through which the scalar flux is significantly reduced. Using the Poincar\'e map, we show that these transport barriers coincide with the outermost members of elliptic LCSs known as Lagrangian vortex boundaries. Numerical simulations further show that elliptic LCSs can repel elongated swimmers and lead to swimmer depletion within Lagrangian coherent vortices. A simple mechanism shows that such depletion is due to the preferential alignment of elongated swimmers with the tangents of elliptic LCSs. Our results provide insights into understanding the transport of microorganisms in complex flows with dynamical topological features from a Lagrangian viewpoint.</description>
