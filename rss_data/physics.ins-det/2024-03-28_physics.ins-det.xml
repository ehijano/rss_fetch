      <title>Calibration of the Scintillation Timing in SNO+ using In-Situ Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SNO+ Collaboration has recently concluded loading its liquid scintillator with PPO, the primary fluor, and the loading of the wavelength shifter, bisMSB, is ongoing. For each stage of the experiment, reliable position and energy reconstruction is essential, and in the face of a changing scintillator cocktail, methods have been developed to rapidly calibrate the SNO+ optical model. To this end, a novel technique for calibrating the time response of the SNO+ liquid scintillator using in-situ backgrounds was developed. By using in-situ coincident backgrounds, it is possible to calibrate both the $\beta^-$ and $\alpha$ time responses, as well as facilitate frequent monitoring of the background levels without compromising the radiopurity of the detector. Accurate calibration of the liquid scintillator emission times allows the exploration of time-based particle discrimination, such as between single-site ($\beta^-$) and multi-site ($\beta^- \gamma$) interactions.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark-field signal uncovers details beyond conventional X-ray attenuation contrast, which is especially valuable for material sciences. In particular, dark-field techniques are able to reveal structures beyond the spatial resolution of a setup. However, its implementation is yet limited to the micrometer regime. Therefore, we propose a technique to extend full-field transmission X-ray microscopy by the dark-field signal. The proposed method is based on a well-defined illumination of a beam-shaping condenser, which allows to block the bright-field by motorized apertures in the back focal plane of the objective's lens. This method offers a simple implementation and enables rapid modality changes while maintaining short scan times, making dark-field imaging widely available at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Challenges in extracting nonlinear current-induced phenomena in Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An appealing direction to change the properties of strongly correlated materials is to induce nonequilibrium steady states by the application of a direct current. While access to these novel states is of high scientific interest, Joule heating due to current flow often constitutes a hurdle to identify nonthermal effects. The biggest challenge usually resides in measuring accurately the temperature of a sample subjected to direct current, and to use probes that give direct information of the material. In this work, we exploit the simultaneous measurement of electrical transport and magnetisation to probe non-equilibrium steady states in Ca2RuO4. In order to reveal non-thermal current-induced effects, we employ a simple model of Joule self-heating to remove the effects of heating and discuss the importance of temperature inhomogeneity within the sample. Our approach provides a solid basis for investigating current-induced phenomena in highly resistive materials.</description>

      <title>Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy Setup with Incidence Angle Selection for Surfaces of Non-Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS) on dielectric single crystals is challenging because the optimal incidence angles for light-adsorbate interaction coincide with regions of low IR reflectivity. Here, we introduce an optimized IRAS setup that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for non-metals. This is achieved by maximizing light throughput, and by selecting optimal incidence angles that directly impact the peak heights in the spectra. The setup uses a commercial FTIR spectrometer and is usable in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Specifically, the design features sample illumination and collection mirrors with a high numerical aperture inside the UHV system, and an adjustable aperture to select the incidence angle range on the sample. This is important for p-polarized measurements on dielectrics, because the peaks in the spectra reverse direction at the Brewster angle (band inversion). The system components are connected precisely via a single flange, ensuring long-term stability. We studied the signal-to-noise (SNR) variation in p-polarized IRAS spectra for one monolayer of CO on TiO2(110) as a function of incidence angle range, where a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 70 was achieved at 4 cm-1 resolution in five minutes measurement time. The capabilities for s-polarization are demonstrated by measuring one monolayer D2O adsorbed on a TiO2(110) surface, where a SNR of 65 was achieved at a delta_R/R0 peak height of 1.4x10-4 in twenty minutes.</description>

      <title>Development of wavelength-shifting PEN foils for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils have been demonstrated as a wavelength shifter suitable for operation in liquid argon. At the same time, wavelength shifting efficiency of technical grades of PEN, commercially available on the market, is lower than that of tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). This paper reports on an R&amp;D program focused on exploring the intrinsic limitations of PEN and optimizing it for the highest achievable wavelength shifting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ambient Dose and Dose Rate Measurement in SNOLAB Underground Laboratory at Sudbury, Ontario, Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper describes a system and experimental procedure that use integrating passive detectors, such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), for the measurement of ultra-low-level ambient dose equivalent rate values at the underground SNOLAB facility located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Because these detectors are passive and can be exposed for relatively long periods of time, they can provide better sensitivity for measuring ultra-low activity levels. The final characterization of ultra-low-level ambient dose around water shielding for ongoing direct dark matter search experiments in Cube Hall at SNOLAB underground laboratory is given. The conclusion is that TLDs provide reliable results in the measurement of the ultra-low-level environmental radiation background.</description>

      <title>Scintillation characteristics of the EJ-299-02H scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the dead layer thickness and quenching factor of a plastic scintillator for use in ultracold neutron (UCN) experiments is described. Alpha spectroscopy was used to determine the thickness of a thin surface dead layer, and the relative light outputs from the decay of $^{241}$Am and Compton scattering of electrons were used to extract the quenching parameter. With these characteristics of the material known, the light yield of the scintillator can be calculated. The ability to make these scintillators deuterated, accompanied by its relatively thin dead layer, make it ideal for use in UCN experiment, where the light yield of decay electrons and alphas from neutron capture are critical for counting events.</description>

      <title>A New Family of High-Current Cyclotrons for Isotope Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are developing a high-current cyclotron as a driver for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment. It accelerates 5 mA H2+ to 60 MeV/amu, after which the electron is removed to produce a 10 mA, 60 MeV proton beam. The enabling innovations that offset space-charge effects occur at injection and in the first few turns, allowing one to construct cyclotrons with energies ranging from below 5 MeV up to 60 MeV/amu, or possibly higher, with the same performance for accelerated ions with Q/A = 0.5 (H2+, D+, He++, ...). In this paper, we discuss the possible uses of such cyclotrons for isotope production, including production of long-lived generator parents (68Ga, 44Ti, 82Sr,...), as well as intense fast neutron beams from deuteron breakup for (n,2n) production of isotopes like 225Ac.</description>
