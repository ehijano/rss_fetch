      <title>Optimally Dictatorial Committees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the optimal voting mechanism for a committee that must decide whether to enact or block a policy of unknown benefit. Information can come both from committee members who can acquire it at cost, and a strategic lobbyist who wishes the policy to be enacted. I show that the dictatorship of the most-demanding member is a dominant voting mechanism: any other voting mechanism is (i) less likely to enact a good policy, (ii) more likely to enact a bad policy, and (iii) burdens every member with a greater cost of acquiring information.</description>

      <title>Optimally Biased Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in delegation problems, a principal benefits from belief misalignment vis-\`a-vis an agent when the latter can flexibly acquire costly information. The agent optimally succumbs to confirmatory learning, leading him to favor the ex ante optimal action. We show that the principal prefers to mitigate this by hiring an agent who is ex ante more uncertain about which action is optimal. This is optimal even when the principal is herself biased towards some action: the benefit always outweighs the cost of a small misalignment. Optimally misaligned agent considers weakly more actions than an aligned agent. All results continue to hold when delegation is replaced by communication.</description>

      <title>Trade Networks and the Rise of a Dominant Currency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model where currency issuers provide liquidity, while users in a trade network choose currency usage for trade settlement. We identify a feedback mechanism where a user's currency preference spillovers to others and increases the issuer's commitment to liquidity provision, which in turn increases the adoption of the currency. Our findings highlight not only the advantage of the incumbent issuer in maintaining dominance, but also the conditions that lead to the rise and fall of dominant currencies. Our framework offers testable implications for the share of global settlement currencies, the network structure, and the strategy of issuers.</description>

      <title>Effects of Vote Delegation in Blockchains: Who Wins?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. As a practical consequence, vote delegation can be beneficial for blockchains with highly unbalanced voting rights, but not for those with balanced rights. In decentralized finance (DeFi), vote delegation is widely adopted to streamline governance and increase participation. However, it remains unclear when delegation actually aligns outcomes with community preferences.</description>
