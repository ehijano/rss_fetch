      <title>Emergency Department Patient Flow Optimization with an Alternative Care Threshold Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.</description>

      <title>Long-term Monitoring of Kernel and Hardware Events to Understand Latency Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents our experience to understand latency variance caused by kernel and hardware events, which are often invisible at the application level. For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.
  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.</description>

      <title>Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Python based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": &gt;= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N &gt;= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.</description>

      <title>SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An Exploration of 8-Bit Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>
