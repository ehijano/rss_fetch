      <title>Minimal covers with continuity-preserving transfer operators for topological dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-invertible dynamical system with a transfer operator, we show there is a minimal cover with a transfer operator that preserves continuous functions. We also introduce an essential cover with even stronger continuity properties. For one-sided sofic subshifts, this generalizes the Krieger and Fischer covers, respectively. Our construction is functorial in the sense that certain equivariant maps between dynamical systems lift to equivariant maps between their covers, and these maps also satisfy better regularity properties. As applications, we identify finiteness conditions which ensure that the thermodynamic formalism is valid for the covers. This establishes the thermodynamic formalism for a large class of non-invertible dynamical systems, e.g. certain piecewise invertible maps. When applied to semi-\'etale groupoids, our minimal covers produce \'etale groupoids which are models for $C^*$-algebras constructed by Thomsen. The dynamical covers and groupoid covers are unified under the common framework of topological graphs.</description>

      <title>From curve shortening to flat link stability and Birkhoff sections of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new theorems on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for orientable closed Riemannian surfaces of positive genus, asserting that the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops. The third theorem asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed orientable Riemannian surface of positive genus.</description>

      <title>On the transition between autonomous and nonautonomous systems: the case of FitzHugh-Nagumo's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with a parametric linear interpolation between an autonomous FitzHugh-Nagumo model and a nonautonomous skewed-problem with the same fundamental structure. This paradigmatic example allows to construct a family of nonautonomous dynamical systems with an attracting integral manifold and a hyperbolic repelling trajectory located within the nonautonomous set enclosed by the integral manifold. Upon the variation of the parameter the integral manifold collapses, the hyperbolic repelling solution disappears and a unique globally attracting hyperbolic solution arises in what could be considered yet another nonautonomous Hopf bifurcation pattern. Interestingly, the three phenomena do not happen at the same critical value of the parameter, yielding thus an example of a nonautonomous bifurcation in two steps. We provide a mathematical description of the dynamical objects at play and analyze the periodically forced case via rigorously validated continuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any post-critically finite rational map $f$ on the Riemann sphere $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ and for each sufficiently large integer $n$, there exists a finite and connected graph $G$ in the Julia set of $f$, such that $f^n(G)\subset G$, $G$ contains all post-critical points in the Julia set and every component of $\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus G$ contains at most one post-critical point in the Fatou set. The proof is based on the cluster-\Sie\ decomposition of post-critically finite rational maps.</description>

      <title>Every finite set of natural numbers is realizable as algebraic periods of a Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A given self-map $f\colon M\to M$ of a compact manifold determines the sequence $\{L(f^n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$, of the Lefschetz numbers of its iterations. We consider its dual sequence $\{a_n(f)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ given by the M\"obius inversion formula. The set ${\mathcal AP}(f)=\{ n\in \mathbb N\ \colon\ a_n(f)\neq 0\}$ is called the set of algebraic periods.
  We solve an open problem existing in literature by showing that for every finite subset ${\mathcal A}$ of natural numbers there exist an orientable surface $S_{\rm g}$, as well as a non-orientable surface $N_{\rm g}$, of genus ${\rm g}$, and a Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphism $f$ of this surface such that $\mathcal{AP}(f)=\mathcal{A}$. For such a map it implies the existence of points of a minimal period $n$ for each odd $n \in \mathcal{A}$. For the orientation-reversing Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms of $S_{\rm g}$ we identify strong restrictions on ${\mathcal AP}(f)$. Our method also provides an estimate of the number of homotopy classes of Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms, which is exponential in ${\rm g}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting random bifurcations via rigorous enclosures of large deviations rate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measur</description>

      <title>Stationary states of aggregation-diffusion equations with compactly supported attraction kernels: radial symmetry and mass-independent boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal aggregation diffusion equation incorporating repulsion modelled by nonlinear diffusion and attraction modelled by nonlocal interaction. When the attractive interaction kernel is radially symmetric and strictly increasing on its domain it is previously known that all stationary solutions are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation; however, this result has not been extended to accommodate attractive kernels that are non-decreasing, for instance, attractive kernels with bounded support. For the diffusion coefficient $m&gt;1$, we show that, for attractive kernels that are radially symmetric and non-decreasing, all stationary states are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation on each connected subset of their support. Furthermore, for $m&gt;2$, we prove analytically that stationary states have an upper-bound independent of the initial data, confirming previous numerical results given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Observability of Temporal Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous complex systems, such as those arisen in ecological networks, genomic contact networks, and social networks, exhibit higher-order and time-varying characteristics, which can be effectively modeled using temporal hypergraphs. However, analyzing and controlling temporal hypergraphs poses significant challenges due to their inherent time-varying and nonlinear nature, while most existing methods predominantly target static hypergraphs. In this article, we generalize the notions of controllability and observability to temporal hypergraphs by leveraging tensor and nonlinear systems theory. Specifically, we establish tensor-based rank conditions to determine the weak controllability and observability of temporal hypergraphs. The proposed framework is further demonstrated with synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in adaptive higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural and human-made complex systems feature group interactions that adapt over time in response to their dynamic states. However, most of the existing adaptive network models fall short of capturing these group dynamics, as they focus solely on pairwise interactions. In this study, we employ adaptive higher-order networks to describe these systems by proposing a general framework incorporating both adaptivity and group interactions. We demonstrate that global synchronization can exist in those complex structures, and we provide the necessary conditions for the emergence of a stable synchronous state. Additionally, we analyzed some relevant settings, and we showed that the necessary condition is strongly related to the master stability equation, allowing to separate the dynamical and structural properties. We illustrate our theoretical findings through examples involving adaptive higher-order networks of coupled generalized Kuramoto oscillators with phase lag. We also show that the interplay of group interactions and adaptive connectivity results in the formation of stability regions that can induce transitions between synchronization and desynchronization</description>

      <title>Modularized data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator and generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a widely-used data-driven approach to learn an approximation of the Koopman operator. Consequently, it provides a powerful tool for data-driven analysis, prediction, and control of nonlinear dynamical (control) systems. In this work, we propose a novel modularized EDMD scheme tailored to interconnected systems. To this end, we utilize the structure of the Koopman generator that allows to learn the dynamics of subsystems individually and thus alleviates the curse of dimensionality by considering observable functions on smaller state spaces. Moreover, our approach canonically enables transfer learning if a system encompasses multiple copies of a model as well as efficient adaption to topology changes without retraining. We provide finite-data bounds on the estimation error using tools from graph theory. The efficacy of the method is illustrated by means of various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Water flow model on vegetated hillslopes with erosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The water circulation in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum and particularly the soil erosion induced by water are problems of main concern in the new era of climate change. The present paper aims to provide a mathematical tool to investigate the water-soil and water-plant interactions involved in the complex process of water flow on plant-covered soil surfaces. Basically, the mathematical model consists of an extended Saint-Venant system of equations for water flow coupled with Hairsine-Rose equations for soil erosion. The classical Saint-Venant model is thus modified in order to take into account the presence of plants on the soil surface. On the premise that the model adequately reflects the essence of the reality, a series of numerical experiments are performed to analyze the plant induced effects on water dynamics and soil erosion intensity.
  Given that both, the mathematical model and the accompanying software are flexible enough to reflect the variability of the environmental variables such as soil structure, soil surface roughness, or plant cover structure, each numerical experiment is constructed as an image of a target hydrological context. The dam break problem, flash floods, water-induced soil erosion in a catchment basin are all subjects of numerical analysis. It is shown that the presence of the plant cover drastically modifies the water dynamics and the distribution of the soil eroded particles and one can quantitatively evaluate such effects. The methods described in the paper can also help one to manage the environmental resources in order to avoid the water induced disasters.</description>

      <title>Neural Fields and Noise-Induced Patterns in Neurons on Large Disordered Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in class of a large-dimensional neural networks posed on random graphs and subject to spatio-temporal stochastic forcing. Under generic conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network admits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field equation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance of neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are tractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the diffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find conditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is modelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral waves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence that solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the mean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides a means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations induced by finite-size effects.</description>

Abstract: We consider piecewise smooth vector fields $Z=(Z_+, Z_-)$ defined in $\mathbb{R}^n$ where both vector fields are tangent to the switching manifold $\Sigma$ along a submanifold $M\subset \Sigma$. We shall see that, under suitable assumptions, Filippov convention gives rise to a unique sliding mode on $M$, governed by what we call the {\it tangential sliding vector field}. Here, we will provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for characterizing such a vector field. Additionally, we prove that the tangential sliding vector field is conjugated to the reduced dynamics of a singular perturbation problem arising from the Sotomayor-Teixeira regularization of $Z$ around $M$. Finally, we analyze several examples where tangential sliding vector fields can be observed, including a model for intermittent treatment of HIV.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an analog in the context of rational maps of the idea of hyperbolic Dehn surgery from the theory of Kleinian groups. A surgery sequence is a sequence of postcritically finite maps limiting (in a precise manner) to a postcritically finite map with at least one strictly preperiodic critical orbit. As an application of this idea we give a new and elementary proof of Tan Lei's theorem on the asymptotic self-similarity of Julia Sets and the Mandelbrot Set at Misiurewicz points.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hamiltonian differential systems with homogeneous nonlinearity parts on $\mathbb{C}^2$. Firstly, we present a series of topological properties of polynomial Hamiltonian functions, with a particular focus on the characteristics of critical points and non-trivial cycles that vanish at infinity. Secondly, we use these topological properties to derive a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for isochronous centers in this class of systems of any degree. Our method avoids tedious computation of the coefficients of normalization occurring in the usual tools to deal with the isochronicity problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a Melnikov-like function that governs the existence of periodic solutions bifurcating from period annuli in certain families of second-order discontinuous differential equations of the form $\ddot{x}+\alpha\; \textrm{sign}(x)=\eta x+\varepsilon \;f(t,x,\dot{x})$. This family has attracted considerable attention from researchers, particularly in the analysis of specific instances of $f(t,x,\dot{x})$. The study of this type of differential equation is motivated by its significance in modeling systems with abrupt state changes, both in natural and engineering contexts.</description>

Abstract: We establish counting, mixing and equidistribution results for finite BMS measures on flow spaces associated to geometrically finite convergence group actions. We show that, in particular, these results apply to flow spaces associated to relatively Anosov groups.</description>

      <title>Foliated Plateau problems and asymptotic counting of surface subgroups</title>

Abstract: In [17], Labourie initiated the study of the dynamical properties of the space of $k$-surfaces, that is, suitably complete immersed surfaces of constant extrinsic curvature in $3$-dimensional manifolds, which he presented as a higher-dimensional analogue of the geodesic flow when the ambient manifold is negatively curved. In this paper, following the recent work [5] of Calegari--Marques--Neves, we study the asymptotic counting of surface subgroups in terms of areas of $k$-surfaces. We determine a lower bound, and we prove rigidity when this bound is achieved. Our work differs from that of [5] in two key respects. Firstly, we work with all quasi-Fuchsian subgroups as opposed to merely asymptotically Fuchsian ones. Secondly, as the proof of rigidity in [5] breaks down in the present case, we require a different approach. Following ideas outlined by Labourie in [19], we prove rigidity by solving a general foliated Plateau problem in Cartan--Hadamard manifolds. To this end, we build on Labourie's theory of $k$-surface dynamics, and propose a number of new constructions, conjectures and questions.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>

Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with the F\o lner property is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>An agent design with goal reaching guarantees for enhancement of learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18118</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Comparative experiments on several problems under popular baseline agents provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>
