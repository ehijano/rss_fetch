      <title>Conceptual Mapping of Controversies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With our work, we contribute towards a qualitative analysis of the discourse on controversies in online news media. For this, we employ Formal Concept Analysis and the economics of conventions to derive conceptual controversy maps. In our experiments, we analyze two maps from different news journals with methods from ordinal data science. We show how these methods can be used to assess the diversity, complexity and potential bias of controversies. In addition to that, we discuss how the diagrams of concept lattices can be used to navigate between news articles.</description>

      <title>Investigating the dissemination of STEM content on social media with computational tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms can quickly disseminate STEM content to diverse audiences, but their operation can be mysterious. We used open-source machine learning methods such as clustering, regression, and sentiment analysis to analyze over 1000 videos and metrics thereof from 6 social media STEM creators. Our data provide insights into how audiences generate interest signals(likes, bookmarks, comments, shares), on the correlation of various signals with views, and suggest that content from newer creators is disseminated differently. We also share insights on how to optimize dissemination by analyzing data available exclusively to content creators as well as via sentiment analysis of comments.</description>

      <title>"I'm in the Bluesky Tonight": Insights from a Year Worth of Social Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pollution of online social spaces caused by rampaging d/misinformation is a growing societal concern. However, recent decisions to reduce access to social media APIs are causing a shortage of publicly available, recent, social media data, thus hindering the advancement of computational social science as a whole. We present a large, high-coverage dataset of social interactions and user-generated content from Bluesky Social to address this pressing issue. The dataset contains the complete post history of over 4M users (81% of all registered accounts), totalling 235M posts. We also make available social data covering follow, comment, repost, and quote interactions. Since Bluesky allows users to create and bookmark feed generators (i.e., content recommendation algorithms), we also release the full output of several popular algorithms available on the platform, along with their timestamped ``like'' interactions and time of bookmarking. This dataset allows unprecedented analysis of online behavior and human-machine engagement patterns. Notably, it provides ground-truth data for studying the effects of content exposure and self-selection and performing content virality and diffusion analysis.</description>

      <title>Smart Pilot Assignment for IoT in Massive MIMO Systems: A Path Towards Scalable IoT Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G sets the foundation for an era of creativity with its faster speeds, increased data throughput, reduced latency, and enhanced IoT connectivity, all enabled by Massive MIMO (M-MIMO) technology. M-MIMO boosts network efficiency and enhances user experience by employing intelligent user scheduling. This paper presents a user scheduling scheme and pilot assignment strategy designed for IoT devices, emphasizing mitigating pilot contamination, a key obstacle to improving spectral efficiency (SE) and system scalability in M-MIMO networks. We utilize a user clustering-based pilot allocation scheme to boost IoT device scalability in M-MIMO systems. Additionally, our smart pilot allocation minimizes interference and enhances SE by treating pilot assignment as a graph coloring problem, optimizing it through integer linear programming (ILP). Recognizing the computational complexity of ILP, we introduced a binary search-based heuristic predicated on interference threshold to expedite the computation, while maintaining a near-optimal solution. The simulation results show a significant decrease in the required pilot overhead (about 17%), and substantial enhancement in SE (about 8-14%).</description>

      <title>GuideWalk -- Heterogeneous Data Fusion for Enhanced Learning -- A Multiclass Document Classification Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the prime problems of computer science and machine learning is to extract information efficiently from large-scale, heterogeneous data. Text data, with its syntax, semantics, and even hidden information content, possesses an exceptional place among the data types in concern. The processing of the text data requires embedding, a method of translating the content of the text to numeric vectors. A correct embedding algorithm is the starting point for obtaining the full information content of the text data. In this work, a new embedding method based on the graph structure of the meaningful sentences is proposed. The design of the algorithm aims to construct an embedding vector that constitutes syntactic and semantic elements as well as the hidden content of the text data. The success of the proposed embedding method is tested in classification problems. Among the wide range of application areas, text classification is the best laboratory for embedding methods; the classification power of the method can be tested using dimensional reduction without any further processing. Furthermore, the method can be compared with different embedding algorithms and machine learning methods. The proposed method is tested with real-world data sets and eight well-known and successful embedding algorithms. The proposed embedding method shows significantly better classification for binary and multiclass datasets compared to well-known algorithms.</description>

      <title>Credible, Unreliable or Leaked?: Evidence Verification for Enhanced Automated Fact-checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated fact-checking (AFC) is garnering increasing attention by researchers aiming to help fact-checkers combat the increasing spread of misinformation online. While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</description>

      <title>Catalyzing Social Interactions in Mixed Reality using ML Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create an innovative mixed reality-first social recommendation model, utilizing features uniquely collected through mixed reality (MR) systems to promote social interaction, such as gaze recognition, proximity, noise level, congestion level, and conversational intensity. We further extend these models to include right-time features to deliver timely notifications. We measure performance metrics across various models by creating a new intersection of user features, MR features, and right-time features. We create four model types trained on different combinations of the feature classes, where we compare the baseline model trained on the class of user features against the models trained on MR features, right-time features, and a combination of all of the feature classes. Due to limitations in data collection and cost, we observe performance degradation in the right-time, mixed reality, and combination models. Despite these challenges, we introduce optimizations to improve accuracy across all models by over 14 percentage points, where the best performing model achieved 24% greater accuracy.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology generalizations for Social Media Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study details an approach for the analysis of social media collected political data through the lens of Topological Data Analysis, with a specific focus on Persistent Homology and the political processes they represent by proposing a set of mathematical generalizations using Gaussian functions to define and analyze these Persistent Homology categories. Three distinct types of Persistent Homologies were recurrent across datasets that had been plotted through retweeting patterns and analyzed through the k-Nearest-Neighbor filtrations. As these Persistent Homologies continued to appear, they were then categorized and dubbed Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations. Upon investigating the content of these plotted tweets, specific patterns of interaction and political information dissemination were identified, namely Political Personalism and Political Polarization. Through clustering and application of Gaussian density functions, I have mathematically characterized each category, encapsulating their distinctive topological features. The mathematical generalizations of Bipolar, Nuclear, and Multipolar Constellations developed in this study are designed to inspire other political science digital media researchers to utilize these categories as to identify Persistent Homology in datasets derived from various social media platforms, suggesting the broader hypothesis that such structures are bound to be present on political scraped data regardless of the social media it's derived from. This method aims to offer a new perspective in Network Analysis as it allows for an exploration of the underlying shape of the networks formed by retweeting patterns, enhancing the understanding of digital interactions within the sphere of Computational Social Sciences.</description>

      <title>DF Louvain: Fast Incrementally Expanding Approach for Community Detection on Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of recognizing natural divisions in networks. A relevant challenge in this problem is to find communities on rapidly evolving graphs. In this report we present our Parallel Dynamic Frontier (DF) Louvain algorithm, which given a batch update of edge deletions and insertions, incrementally identifies and processes an approximate set of affected vertices in the graph with minimal overhead, while using a novel approach of incrementally updating weighted-degrees of vertices and total edge weights of communities. We also present our parallel implementations of Naive-dynamic (ND) and Delta-screening (DS) Louvain. On a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, our experiments show that DF Louvain obtains speedups of 179x, 7.2x, and 5.3x on real-world dynamic graphs, compared to Static, ND, and DS Louvain, respectively, and is 183x, 13.8x, and 8.7x faster, respectively, on large graphs with random batch updates. Moreover, DF Louvain improves its performance by 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>Emergence of simple and complex contagion dynamics from weighted belief networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social contagion is a ubiquitous and fundamental process that drives individual and social changes. Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes and biases, the integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social contagion remains an open challenge. In particular, studies on social phenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex, rather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical evidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion dynamics -- from simple to complex -- simultaneously. Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion -- resistance -- can come about from cognitive mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Toxic Bias: Perspective API Misreads German as More Toxic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proprietary public APIs play a crucial and growing role as research tools among social scientists. Among such APIs, Google's machine learning-based Perspective API is extensively utilized for assessing the toxicity of social media messages, providing both an important resource for researchers and automatic content moderation. However, this paper exposes an important bias in Perspective API concerning German language text. Through an in-depth examination of several datasets, we uncover intrinsic language biases within the multilingual model of Perspective API. We find that the toxicity assessment of German content produces significantly higher toxicity levels than other languages. This finding is robust across various translations, topics, and data sources, and has significant consequences for both research and moderation strategies that rely on Perspective API. For instance, we show that, on average, four times more tweets and users would be moderated when using the German language compared to their English translation. Our findings point to broader risks associated with the widespread use of proprietary APIs within the computational social sciences.</description>

      <title>Winning the Social Media Influence Battle: Uncertainty-Aware Opinions to Understand and Spread True Information via Competitive Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) involves entities competing to maximize influence in online social networks (OSNs). Current Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods in CIM rely on simplistic binary opinion models (i.e., an opinion is represented by either 0 or 1) and often overlook the complexity of users' behavioral characteristics and their prior knowledge. We propose a novel DRL-based framework that enhances CIM analysis by integrating Subjective Logic (SL) to accommodate uncertain opinions, users' behaviors, and their preferences. This approach targets the mitigation of false information by effectively propagating true information. By modeling two competitive agents, one spreading true information and the other spreading false information, we capture the strategic interplay essential to CIM. Our framework utilizes an uncertainty-based opinion model (UOM) to assess the impact on information quality in OSNs, emphasizing the importance of user behavior alongside network topology in selecting influential seed nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving faster and more influential results (i.e., outperforming over 20%) under realistic network conditions. Moreover, our method shows robust performance in partially observable networks, effectively doubling the performance when users are predisposed to disbelieve true information.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Merging Percolation: A long-range percolation process in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Percolation on networks is a common framework to model a wide range of processes, from cascading failures to epidemic spreading. Standard percolation assumes short-range interactions, implying that nodes can merge into clusters only if they are nearest-neighbors. Cumulative Merging Percolation (CMP) is an new percolation process that assumes long-range interactions, such that nodes can merge into clusters even if they are topologically distant. Hence in CMP percolation clusters do not coincide with the topological connected components of the network. Previous work has shown that a specific formulation of CMP features peculiar mechanisms for the formation of the giant cluster, and allows to model different network dynamics such as recurrent epidemic processes. Here we develop a more general formulation of CMP in terms of the functional form of the cluster interaction range, showing an even richer phase transition scenario with competition of different mechanisms resulting in crossover phenomena. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>
