      <title>A Numerical Rosenblatt Method for Forced Variable Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel numerical technique is presented to transform one random variable within a system toward statistical quasi-independence from any other random variable in the system. The method's applicability is demonstrated through a particle physics example where a classifier is rendered quasi-independent from an observable quantity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>

      <title>EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</description>

      <title>Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Surrogate Models: Benchmarking Machine Learning Approaches to Expediting Phase Field Simulations of Brittle Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example, computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100 time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics research.</description>
