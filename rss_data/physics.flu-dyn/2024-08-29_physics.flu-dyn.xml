      <title>ML-ROM Wall Shear Stress Prediction in Patient-Specific Vascular Pathologies under a Limited Clinical Training Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity numerical simulations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have been proven effective in analysing haemodynamics, offering insight into many vascular conditions. However, these methods often face challenges of high computational cost and long processing times. Data-driven approaches such as Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) and Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly being explored alongside CFD to advance biomechanical research and application.
  This study presents an integration of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based ROM with neural network-based ML models to predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) in patient-specific vascular pathologies. CFD was used to generate WSS data, followed by POD to construct the ROM. The ML models were trained to predict the ROM coefficients from the inlet flowrate waveform, which can be routinely collected in the clinic. Two ML models were explored: a simpler flowrate-coefficients mapping model and a more advanced autoregressive model. Both models were tested against two case studies: flow in Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) and flow in Aortic Dissection (AD). Despite the limited training data sets (three flowrate waveforms for the PAD case and two for the AD case), the models were able to predict the haemodynamic indices, with the flowrate-coefficients mapping model outperforming the autoregressive model in both case studies. The accuracy is higher in the PAD case study, with reduced accuracy in the more complex case study of AD. Additionally, the computational cost analysis reveals a significant reduction in computational demands, with speed-up ratios on the order of $10^4$ for both case studies.
  This approach shows an effective integration of ROM and ML techniques for fast and reliable evaluations of haemodynamic properties that contribute to vascular conditions, setting the stage for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Wing twist and folding work in synergy to propel flapping wing animals and robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed and built a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) flapping wing robot, Flapperoo, to study the aerodynamic benefits of wing folding and twisting. Forces and moments of this physical model are measured in wind tunnel tests over a Strouhal number range of St = 0.2 - 0.4, typical for animal flight. We perform particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to visualize the air jet produced by wing clapping under the ventral side of the body when wing folding is at the extreme. The results show that this jet can be directed by controlling the wing twist at the moment of clapping, which leads to greatly enhanced cycle-averaged thrust, especially at high St or low flight speeds. Additional benefits of more thrust and less negative lift are gained during upstroke using wing twist. Remarkably, less total actuating force, or less total power, is required during upstroke with wing twist. These findings emphasize the benefits of critical wing articulation for the future flapping wing/fin robots and for an accurate test platform to study natural flapping wing flight or underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Opposition control applied to turbulent wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LESs) to explore the effects of opposition control (OC) on turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over a wing at a chord-based Reynolds number (${Re}_c$) of 200,000. Two scenarios were studied: flow over the suction sides of the NACA0012 wing section at a $0^{\circ}$ angle of attack, and the NACA4412 wing section at a $5^{\circ}$ angle of attack, representing TBLs under mild and strong nonuniform adverse pressure gradients (APGs), respectively. Our results show that the effectiveness of OC in reducing friction drag decreases significantly with increasing APG intensity. This reduction is linked to intensified wall-normal convection caused by the stronger APG. OC, designed to reduce near-wall fluctuations, attenuates the outer peak of streamwise velocity fluctuations and the production term of the turbulent kinetic energy budget. We also confirmed the formation of a "virtual wall," where the balance between viscous diffusion and dissipation at the virtual wall plane mirrors that at the physical wall. Spectral analyses reveal that the wall-normal transport of small-scale structures to the outer region due to the APG negatively impacts OC performance. We also examined uniform blowing and body-force damping as control strategies. Uniform blowing mimics the effects of a stronger APG, while body-force damping shares similarities with OC in the streamwise development of the TBL, despite differences in turbulent statistics. This study is the first detailed analysis of OC applied to TBLs under nonuniform APGs with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weakly nonlinear study is numerically conducted to determine the behaviour near the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells. The mathematical and numerical procedure is described in generality, with the results presented for an Earth-like radius ratio. Through the weakly nonlinear analysis a Stuart--Landau equation is obtained for the amplitude of the convective instability, valid in the vicinity of its onset. Using this amplitude equation we derive a reduced order model for the saturation of the instability via nonlinear effects and can completely describe the resultant limit cycle without the need to solve initial value problems. In particular the weakly nonlinear analysis is able to determine whether convection onsets as a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation through solving only linear 2D problems, specifically one eigenvalue and two linear boundary value problems. Using this, we efficiently determine that convection can onset subcritically in a spherical shell for a range of Prandtl numbers if the shell is heated internally, confirming previous predictions. Furthermore, by examining the weakly nonlinear coefficients we show that it is the strong zonal flow created through Reynolds and thermal stresses that determines whether convection is supercritical or subcritical.</description>

      <title>Phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann method for the transport of insoluble surfactant in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general second-order phase-field model for the transport of insoluble surfactant in incompressible two-phase flows. In this model, the second-order local Allen-Cahn equation is applied for interface capturing, a general form of the simple scalar transport equation [S. S. Jain, J. Comput. Phys. 515, 113277 (2024)] is adopted for interface-confined surfactant, and the consistent and conservative Navier-Stokes equations with the Marangoni force is used for fluid flows. To solve this model, we further developed a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, in which the LB model for surfactant transport equation is proposed under the general LB framework for the convection-diffusion type equation, and it can correctly recover the governing equation for surfactant transport. The accuracy of the present LB method is tested by several benchmark problems, and the numerical results show it has a good performance for the transport of the insoluble surfactant in two-phase flows.</description>

      <title>Spectrum correction on Ekman-Navier-Stokes equation in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been long known that the addition of linear friction on two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence, often referred to as Ekman-Navier-Stokes (ENS) turbulence, induces strong intermittent fluctuations on small-scale vorticity. Such fluctuations are strong enough to be measurable at low-order statistics such as the energy or enstrophy spectrum. Simple heuristics lead to corrections in the spectrum which are proportional to the linear friction coefficient. In this work, we study the spectral correction by the implementation of a GPU-accelerated high-resolution numerical simulation of ENS covering a large range of Reynolds numbers. Among our findings, we highlight the importance of non-locality when comparing the expected results to the measured ones.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of water-in-oil microemulsion droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulsion fuels have the potential to reduce both particulate matter and NOx emissions and can potentially improve the efficiency of combustion engines. However, their limited stability remains a critical barrier to practical use as an alternative fuel. In this study, we explore the evaporation behavior of thermodynamically stable water-in-oil microemulsions. The water-in-oil microemulsion droplets prepared from different types of oil were acoustically levitated and heated using a continuous laser at different irradiation intensities. We show that the evaporation characteristics of these microemulsions can be controlled by varying water-to-surfactant molar ratio ({\omega}) and volume fraction of the dispersed phase ({\phi}). The emulsion droplets undergo three distinct stages of evaporation, namely pre-heating, steady evaporation, and unsteady evaporation. During the steady evaporation phase, increasing {\phi} reduces the evaporation rate for a fixed {\omega}. It is observed that the evaporation of microemulsion is governed by the complex interplay between its constituents and their properties. We propose a parameter ({\eta}) denoting the volume fraction ratio between volatile and non-volatile components, which indicates the cumulative influence of various factors affecting the evaporation process. The evaporation of microemulsions eventually leads to the formation of solid spherical shells, which may undergo buckling. The distinction in the morphology of these shells is explored in detail using SEM imaging.</description>

      <title>The interpretation of the amplitude modulation coefficient and a transport-based alternative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude modulation coefficient, $R$, that is widely used to characterize non-linear interactions between large- and small-scale motions in wall-bounded turbulence is not actually compatible with detecting the convective non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes equations. Through a spectral decomposition of $R$ and a simplified model of triadic convective interactions, we show that $R$ actually suppresses the signature of convective scale interactions, and we suggest that what $R$ likely measures is linear interactions between large-scale motions and the background mean flow. We propose an alternative coefficient which is specifically designed for the detection of convective non-linearities, and we show how this new coefficient, $R_T$, also quantifies the turbulent kinetic energy transport involved in turbulent scale interactions.</description>

      <title>On the art of designing effective space-times with free surface flows in Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating/decelerating trans-critical flows (waterfalls/cataracts) are analogous to space-times of black holes/white fountains since the pioneering work of Sch{\"u}tzhold \&amp;amp; Unruh in 2002. A single number is usually employed to classify trans-criticality namely the local depth Froude number which is the ratio between the local current speed and the local celerity of long gravity waves analogous to the light celerity. When the former reaches one, water waves are no more able to propagate upstream: the hydraulic black hole is a river of no return for them. At a higher level of understanding, two global dimensionless numbers, the upstream Froude number F r up and the obstruction ratio r up (the height of a bottom obstacle, the underlying geometry inducing the effective space-time, divided by the upstream water depth) are essential to distinguish subcritical, trans-critical and supercritical zones in the -F r up versus r up -hydraulic and nondispersive diagram. The relationship between both global parameters for transcritical flows turns out to be a peculiar limit of the behaviour of boats navigating in confined media like canals or locks with a generalized obstruction factor based on the ratio between the boat section and the canal section. Here, we revisit the classification of flows over obstacles in open water channel taking into account both effects of dispersion and scale, two neglected topics so far. For the first time, we give a complete classification of flows in an open water channel based on sub-pixel detection method measurements of the free surface supported by numerical simulations. We generalized the obstruction factor by a filling factor taking into account the maximum height of the water channel, a crucial parameter that was overlooked so far. Our ultimate purpose is to understand how to reproduce in the laboratory analogues of curved space-times from the dynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>DWR-Drag: A new generation software for the Double Wall-Ring Interfacial Shear Rheometer's data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double wall-ring (DWR) rotational configuration is nowadays the instrument of choice regarding interfacial shear rheometers (ISR) in rotational configurations. Complex numerical schemes must be used in the analysis of the output data in order to appropriately deal with the coupling between interfacial and bulk fluid flows, and to separate viscous and elastic contribution or the interfacial response. We present a second generation code for analyzing the interfacial shear rheology experimental results of small amplitude oscillatory measurements made with a DWR rotational rheometer. The package presented here improves significantly the accuracy and applicability range of the previous available software packages by implementing: i) a physically motivated iterative scheme based on the probe's equation of motion, ii) an increased user selectable spatial resolution, and iii) a second order approximation for the velocity gradients at the ring surfaces. Moreover, the optimization of the computational effort allows, in many cases, for on-the-fly execution during data acquisition in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating near-surface wind speeds simulated by the CRCM6-GEM5 model using AmeriFlux data over North America</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of various configurations of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6-GEM5) in simulating 10-meter wind speeds using data from 27 AmeriFlux stations across North America. The assessment employs a hierarchy of error metrics, ranging from simple mean bias to advanced metrics that account for the dependence of wind speeds on variables such as friction velocity and stability. The results reveal that (i) the value of roughness length (z0) has a large effect on the simulation of wind speeds, (ii) using a lower limit for the Obhukov length instead of a lower limit for the lowest level wind speed seems to deteriorate the simulation of wind speeds under very stable conditions, (iii) the choice of stability function has a small but noticeable impact on the wind speeds, (iv) the turbulent orographic form drag scheme shows improvement over effective roughness length approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most passive droplet transport strategies rely on spatial variations of material properties to drive droplet motion, leading to gradient-based mechanisms with intrinsic length scales that limit the droplet velocity or the transport distance. Here, we propose droplet {\it fibrotaxis}, a novel mechanism that leverages an anisotropic fiber-reinforced deformable solid to achieve spontaneous and gradient-free droplet transport. Using high-fidelity simulations, we identify the fluid wettability, fiber orientation, anisotropy strength and elastocapillary number as critical parameters that enable controllable droplet velocity and long-range droplet transport. Our results highlight the potential of fibrotaxis as a droplet transport mechanism that can have a strong impact on self-cleaning surfaces, water harvesting and medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>On the laminar solutions and stability of accelerating and decelerating channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of acceleration and deceleration on the stability of channel flows. To do so, we derive an exact solution for laminar profiles of channel flows with arbitrary, time-varying wall motion and pressure gradient. This solution then allows us to investigate the stability of any unsteady channel flow. In particular, we restrict our investigation to the nonnormal growth of perturbations about time-varying base flows with exponentially decaying acceleration and deceleration, with comparisons to growth about a constant base flow (i.e., the time-invariant simple shear or parabolic profile). We apply this acceleration and deceleration through the velocity of the walls and through the flow rate. For accelerating base flows, perturbations never grow larger than perturbations about a constant base flow, while decelerating flows show massive amplification of perturbations - at a Reynolds number of 500, properly timed perturbations about the decelerating base flow grow $\mathscr{O}(10^5)$ times larger than perturbations grow about a constant base flow. This amplification increases as we raise the rate of deceleration and the Reynolds number. We find that this amplification arises due to a transition from spanwise perturbations leading to the largest amplification, to streamwise perturbations leading to the largest amplification that only occurs in the decelerating base flow. By evolving the optimal perturbations through the linearized equations of motion, we reveal that the decelerating base flow achieves this massive amplification through the Orr mechanism, or the down-gradient Reynolds stress mechanism, which accelerating and constant base flows cannot maintain.</description>

      <title>A comparison of different approaches to compute surface tension contribution in incompressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

Abstract: The current study aims to evaluate and investigate the development of projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for efficient and accurate RDE simulations. Specifically, we focus on assessing the projection-based ROM construction utilizing three different approaches: the linear static basis, nonlinear quadratic basis, and an adaptive model order reduction (MOR) formulation. First, an ~\textit{a priori} analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the linear static and nonlinear quadratic bases in representing the detonation-wave dynamics. The~\textit{a priori} analysis reveals that compared to the linear basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis provides significantly improved representation of detonation-wave dynamics within the training regime. However, it exhibits limited capabilities in representing the dynamics beyond the training regime, either in the future state or under a different operating parameter (i.e., inlet velocity). Second, the investigations proceed to the adaptive MOR formulation, which constructs an \textit{online} adaptive ROM with a small amount of offline training data. It is demonstrated that the adaptive ROM can provide significantly enhanced predictive capabilities in modeling the RDE dynamics in the future state, and subject to parametric variations. More importantly, the adaptive ROM is shown to be capable of capturing the initial transience in establishing the detonation wave.</description>

      <title>Twist, turn and encounter: the trajectories of small atmospheric particles unravelled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11487</link>

Abstract: Every solid particle in the atmosphere, from ice crystals and pollen to dust, ash, and microplastics, is non-spherical. These particles play significant roles in Earth's climate system, influencing temperature, weather patterns, natural ecosystems, human health, and pollution levels. However, our understanding of these particles is largely based on the theories for extremely small particles and experiments conducted in liquid mediums. In this study, we used an innovative experimental setup and particle-resolved numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of sub-millimetre ellipsoids of varying shapes in the air. Our results revealed complex decaying oscillation patterns involving numerous twists and turns in these particles, starkly contrasting their dynamics in liquid mediums. We found that the frequency and decay rate of these oscillations have a strong dependence on the particle shape. Interestingly, disk-shaped particles oscillated at nearly twice the frequency of rod-shaped particles, though their oscillations also decayed more rapidly. During oscillation, even subtly non-spherical particles can drift laterally up to ten times their volume-equivalent spherical diameter. This behaviour enables particles to sweep through four times more air both vertically and laterally compared to a volume-equivalent sphere, significantly increasing their encounter rate and aggregation possibility. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-range transport and naturally occurring aggregate formation of highly non-spherical particles such as snowflakes and volcanic ash.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>
