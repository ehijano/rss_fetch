      <title>How Visa-Free Policies Fuel International Research Collaboration: Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visa regimes constitute significant institutional barriers to the cross-border mobility of researchers. Utilizing China's phased implementation of a unilateral visa-free policy since 2023 as a quasi-natural experiment, this study employs a staggered difference-in-differences design to assess the policy's effect on international scientific collaboration. Results indicate that the policy significantly increased the volume of Sino-foreign co-authored publications. The mechanism analysis indicates that this effect is primarily achieved by enhancing transportation accessibility and human mobility, which in turn facilitates cross-border research collaboration among scholars. Further evidence suggests that academic conferences partially attenuated the policy's impact, indicating a substitutive relationship across collaboration channels. Moreover, the effect was more pronounced for countries with greater geographical distance or lower research capacity. This study elucidates the mechanisms through which visa facilitation promotes international scientific collaboration and offers new insights into how institutional barriers shape research cooperation and knowledge production.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Robust Multilingual Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale digitization initiatives have unlocked massive collections of historical newspapers, yet effective computational access remains hindered by OCR corruption, multilingual orthographic variation, and temporal language drift. We develop and evaluate a multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline specifically designed for question answering on noisy historical documents. Our approach integrates: (i) semantic query expansion and multi-query fusion using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to improve retrieval robustness against vocabulary mismatch; (ii) a carefully engineered generation prompt that enforces strict grounding in retrieved evidence and explicit abstention when evidence is insufficient; and (iii) a modular architecture enabling systematic component evaluation. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on Named Entity Recognition and embedding model selection, demonstrating the importance of syntactic coherence in entity extraction and balanced performance-efficiency trade-offs in dense retrieval. Our end-to-end evaluation framework shows that the pipeline generates faithful answers for well-supported queries while correctly abstaining from unanswerable questions. The hybrid retrieval strategy improves recall stability, particularly benefiting from RRF's ability to smooth performance variance across query formulations. We release our code and configurations at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RAGs-C5AE/, providing a reproducible foundation for robust historical document question answering.</description>

      <title>Citation importance-aware document representation learning for large-scale science mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective science mapping relies on high-quality representations of scientific documents. As an important task in scientometrics and information studies, science mapping is often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of citations. While previous studies have attempted to improve document representations by integrating citation and semantic information, the heterogeneity of citations is often overlooked. To address this problem, this study proposes a citation importance-aware contrastive learning framework that refines the supervisory signal. We first develop a scalable measurement of citation importance based on location, frequency, and self-citation characteristics. Citation importance is then integrated into the contrastive learning process through an importance-aware sampling strategy, which selects low-importance citations as hard negatives. This forces the model to learn finer-grained representations that distinguish between important and perfunctory citations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we fine-tune a SciBERT model and perform extensive evaluations on SciDocs and PubMed benchmark datasets. Results show consistent improvements in both document representation quality and science mapping accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the trained model to over 33 million documents from Web of Science. The resulting map of science accurately visualizes the global and local intellectual structure of science and reveals interdisciplinary research fronts. By operationalizing citation heterogeneity into a scalable computational framework, this study demonstrates how differentiating citations by their importance can be effectively leveraged to improve document representation and science mapping.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Scalable Digital Twin Deployment in Smart Campus Building Facility Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) offers significant opportunities for enhancing facility management (FM) in campus environments. However, existing research often focuses narrowly on isolated domains, such as point-cloud geometry or energy analytics, without providing a scalable and interoperable workflow that integrates building geometry, equipment metadata, and operational data into a unified FM platform. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for scalable digital-twin deployment in smart campus buildings by integrating 3D laser scanning, BIM modeling, and IoT-enabled data visualization to support facility operations and maintenance. The methodology includes: (1) reality capture using terrestrial laser scanning and structured point-cloud processing; (2) development of an enriched BIM model incorporating architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, conveying, and sensor systems; and (3) creation of a digital-twin environment that links equipment metadata, maintenance policies, and simulated IoT data within a digital-twin management platform. A case study of the Price Gilbert Building at Georgia Tech demonstrates the implementation of this workflow. A total of 509 equipment items were modeled and embedded with OmniClass classifications into the digital twin. Ten interactive dashboards were developed to visualize system performance. Results show that the proposed framework enables centralized asset documentation, improved system visibility, and enhanced preventive and reactive maintenance workflows. Although most IoT data were simulated due to limited existing sensor infrastructure, the prototype validates the feasibility of a scalable digital twin for facility management and establishes a reference model for real-time monitoring, analytics integration, and future autonomous building operations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Main Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Main path analysis has long been used to trace knowledge trajectories in citation networks, yet it lacks solid theoretical foundations. To understand when and why this approach succeeds, we analyse directed acyclic graphs created from two types of artificial models and by looking at over twenty networks derived from real data.
  We show that entropy-based variants of main path analysis optimise geometric distance measures, providing its first information-theoretic and geometric basis. Numerical results demonstrate that existing algorithms converge on near-geodesic solutions. We also show that an approach based on longest paths produces similar results, is equally well motivated yet is much simpler to implement.
  However, the traditional single-path focus is unnecessarily restrictive, as many near-optimal paths highlight different key nodes. We introduce an approach using ``baskets'' of nodes where we select a fraction of nodes with the smallest values of a measure we call ``generalised criticality''. Analysis of large vaccine citation networks shows that these baskets achieve comprehensive algorithmic coverage, offering a robust, simple, and computationally efficient way to identify core knowledge structures. In practice, we find that those nodes with zero unit criticality capture the information in main paths in almost all cases and capture a wider range of key nodes without unnecessarily increasing the number of nodes considered. We find no advantage in using the traditional main path methods.</description>

      <title>A Software Package for Generating Robust and Accurate Potentials using the Moment Tensor Potential Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Plan for Robust and Accurate Potentials (PRAPs), a software package for training and using moment tensor potentials (MTPs) in concert with the Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) software package. PRAPs provides an automated workflow to train MTPs using active learning procedures, and a variety of utilities to ease and improve workflows when utilizing the MLIP software. PRAPs was originally developed in the context of crystal structure prediction, in which one calculates convex hulls and predicts low energy metastable and thermodynamically stable structures, but the potentials PRAPs develops are not limited to such applications. PRAPs produces two potentials, one capable of rough estimates of the energies, forces and stresses of almost any chemical structure in the specified compositional space -- the Robust Potential -- and a second potential intended to provide more accurate descriptions of ground state and metastable structures -- the Accurate Potential. We also present a Python library, mliputils, designed to assist users in working with the chemical structural files used by the MLIP package.</description>

      <title>How permanent are metadata for research data? Understanding changes in DataCite metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the move towards open research information, the DOI registration agency DataCite is increasingly used as a source for metadata describing research data, for example to perform scientometric analyses. However, there is a lack of research on how DataCite metadata describing research data are created and maintained. This paper adresses this gap by using DataCite metadata provenance information to analyze the overall prevalence and patterns of change to DataCite metadata records. Metadata change was observed for 12.18 % of metadata records in the sample, and change tends to be incremental and not extensive. DataCite metadata records offer reliable descriptions of datasets and are stable enough to be used in scientometric research. The rate of change differs from previous studies of metadata change in other contexts, suggesting that there are differences in metadata practices between research data repositories and more traditional cataloging environments. The observed changes do not seem to fully align with idealized conceptualizations of metadata creation and maintenance for research data. In particular, the data does not show that metadata records are maintained routinely and continuously. Metadata change also has a limited effect on metadata completeness.</description>
