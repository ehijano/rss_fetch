      <title>Strong interactions and isospin symmetry breaking in a supermoir\'e lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multilayer moir\'e heterostructures, the interference of multiple twist angles ubiquitously leads to tunable ultra-long-wavelength patterns known as supermoir\'e lattices. However, their impact on the system's many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoir\'e-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoir\'e lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near $\nu=-2$, possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoir\'e lattices as a tunable parameter for designing novel quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>A new theoretical approach to disordered Majorana nanowires: Studying disorder without any disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of disorder and short finite wire length is the crucial physics hindering progress in the semiconductor-superconductor nanowire platform for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZM). Disorder effectively segments the nanowire into isolated patches of quantum dots (QD) which act as subgap Andreev bound states often mimicking MZMs. In this work, we propose and develop a new theoretical approach to model disorder, effectively a spatially varying effective mass model, which does not rely on incorporating unknown microscopic details of disorder into the Hamiltonian. This model effectively segments the wire into multiple QDs, characterized by highly enhanced effective mass at impurity sites leading to the segmentation of the wire into effective random QDs. We find that this model can reproduce disorder physics, providing a crystal clear way to understand the effects of disorder by comparing the mean free path to the superconducting coherence length. In addition, this model allows precise control over the disorder regime, enabling us to evaluate the reliability of topological invariants (TI) in predicting MZMs. We find that TIs alone may yield a significant false positive rate as indicators for topology in the actual wire with increasing disorder strength. Therefore, we propose new indicators to characterize the spatial distribution of the zero-energy state, emphasizing the key necessity for isolated MZMs localized at wire ends. Employing this set of new indicators for stringent characterizations, we explore their experimental relevance to the measured differential conductance spectra. Our findings highlight the critical role of isolated localized states, beyond the TI, in identifying topological MZMs. We believe that this approach is a powerful tool for studying realistic Majorana nanowires where disorder and short wire length obfuscate the underlying topological physics.</description>

      <title>Giant and negative magnetoresistances in conical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetotransport in conical helimagnet crystals. Spin dependent magnetoresistance exhibits dramatic properties for high and low electron concentrations at different temperatures. For spin up electrons we find negative magnetoresistance despite only considering a single carrier type. For spin down electrons we observe giant magnetoresistance due to depletion of spin down electrons with an applied magnetic field. For spin up carriers, the magnetoresistance is negative, due to the increase in charge carriers with a magnetic field. In addition, we investigate spin dependent Hall effect. If a magnetic field reaches some critical value for spin down electrons, giant Hall resistance occurs, i.e., Hall current vanishes. This effect is explained by the absence of spin down carriers. For spin up carriers, the Hall constant dramatically decreases with field, due to the increase in spin up electron density. Because of the giant spin dependent magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity, conical helimagnets could be useful in spin switching devices.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in a ballistic single-channel nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken, superconducting circuits may exhibit a so-called diode effect, where the critical currents for opposite directions of the current flow differ. In recent years, this effect has been observed in a multitude of systems and the different physical ingredients that may yield such an effect are well understood. On a microscopic level, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field may give rise to a diode effect in a single Josephson junction. However, so far there is no analytical description of the effect within a simple model. Here we study a single channel nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and subject to a Zeeman field. We show that the different Fermi velocities and spin projections of the two pseudo-spin bands lead to a diode effect. Simple analytical expressions for the efficiency can be obtained in limiting cases.</description>

      <title>Real-space Calculation of Orbital Hall Responses in Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an efficient numerical approach to compute the different components of the orbital Hall responses in disordered materials from the Berry phase theory of magnetization. We propose a theoretical framework based on the Chebyshev expansion of Green's functions and the position operator for systems under arbitrary boundary conditions. The capability of this scheme is illustrated by computing the orbital Hall conductivity for gapped graphene and Haldane model in the presence of nonperturbative disorder effects. This methodology opens the door to realistic simulations of orbital Hall responses in arbitrary complex models of disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable High-Chern-number quasiflat bands in twisted antiferromagnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated flat bands with significantly quenched kinetic energy of electrons could give rise to exotic strongly correlated states from electron-electron interactions. More intriguingly, the interplay between topology and flat bands can further lead to richer physical phenomena, which have attracted much interest. Here, taking advantage of the recently proposed intertwined Dirac states induced from the anisotropic coupling between top and bottom surface states of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin film, we show the emergence of a high-Chern-number (quasi)flat-band state through Moir\'e engineering of the surface states. Remarkably, the flat bands are isolated from other bands and located near the Fermi level. Furthermore, topological phase transitions between trivial and nontrivial flat-band states can be driven by tuning the out-of-plane electric field. Our work not only proposes a new scheme to realize high-Chern-number flat-band states, but also highlights the versatility of the intertwined Dirac-cone states.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells near the crossover between $\varGamma$- and $X$-valley confined electron states. The time-integrated photoluminescence experiment at $T=$4.8 K revealed three simultaneously observed optical transitions resulting from (a) a direct exciton recombination, involving an electron and a hole states both located in the $\varGamma$-valley in the quantum well layer, and (b) two spatially and momentum indirect excitons, comprising of the confined electron states in the $X$-valley in the AlAs barrier with different effective masses and quantum well holes in the $\varGamma$-valley. The measured spatial extent, density dependence and temperature dependence of the structure photoluminescence revealed characteristics necessary to pinpoint the states' nature and provided their characterization crucial in future device design. Temporal dynamics observed in the time-resolved photoluminescence measurement showed the complexity of the capture and recombination dynamics, largely affected by nonradiative processes, what is additionally critical in the system's use. This solid state platform hosting both direct and indirect excitons in a highly tunable monolithic system can benefit and underline the operation principles of novel electronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Superionic Fluoride Gate Dielectrics with Low Diffusion Barrier for Advanced Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of new dielectrics with large capacitive coupling is an essential topic in modern electronics when conventional dielectrics suffer from the leakage issue near breakdown limit. To address this looming challenge, we demonstrate that rare-earth-metal fluorides with extremely-low ion migration barriers can generally exhibit an excellent capacitive coupling over 20 $\mu$F cm$^{-2}$ (with an equivalent oxide thickness of ~0.15 nm and a large effective dielectric constant near 30) and great compatibility with scalable device manufacturing processes. Such static dielectric capability of superionic fluorides is exemplified by MoS$_2$ transistors exhibiting high on/off current ratios over 10$^8$, ultralow subthreshold swing of 65 mV dec$^{-1}$, and ultralow leakage current density of ~10$^{-6}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Therefore, the fluoride-gated logic inverters can achieve significantly higher static voltage gain values, surpassing ~167, compared to conventional dielectric. Furthermore, the application of fluoride gating enables the demonstration of NAND, NOR, AND, and OR logic circuits with low static energy consumption. Notably, the superconductor-to-insulator transition at the clean-limit Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ can also be realized through fluoride gating. Our findings highlight fluoride dielectrics as a pioneering platform for advanced electronics applications and for tailoring emergent electronic states in condensed matters.</description>

      <title>QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging energies and sensor dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosciences largely rely on plasmons which are quasiparticles constituted by collective oscillations of quantum electron gas composed of conduction band electrons that occupy discrete quantum states. Our work has introduced non-perturbative plasmons with oscillation amplitudes that approach the extreme limit set by breakdown in characteristic coherence. In contrast, conventional plasmons are small-amplitude oscillations. Controlled excitation of extreme plasmons modeled in our work unleashes unprecedented Petavolts per meter fields. In this work, an analytical model of this new class of plasmons is developed based on quantum kinetic framework. A controllable extreme plasmon, the surface "crunch-in" plasmon, is modeled here using a modified independent electron approximation which takes into account the quantum oscillation frequency. Key characteristics of such realizable extreme plasmons that unlock unparalleled possibilities, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect in a CVD-grown oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) are promising for investigating correlated quantum phenomena. In particular, 2D oxides provide a platform that can host various quantum phases such as quantized Hall effect, superconductivity, or magnetism. The realization of such quantum phases in 2D oxides heavily relies on dedicated heterostructure growths. Here we show the integer quantum Hall effect achieved in chemical vapor deposition grown Bi2O2Se - a representative member of a more accessible oxide family. A single or few sub-band 2DES can be prepared in thin films of Bi2O2Se, where the film thickness acts as the sole design parameter and the sub-band occupation is determined by the electric field effect. This new oxide platform exhibits characteristic advantages in structural flexibility due to its layered nature, making it suitable for scalable growth. The unique small mass distinguishes Bi2O2Se from other high-mobility oxides, providing a new platform for exploring quantum Hall physics in 2D oxides.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. For the first time, we see that the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear transport regimes are achieved using quantum point contacts in the same setup.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a fractal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state, which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a Sierpi\'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify these predictions in designer quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Structural and Magnetic Properties of RFeO3 (R=Dy, Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orthoferrites the rare-earth (R) ion has a big impact on structural and magnetic properties in particular the ionic size influences the octahedral tilt and the R3+- Fe3+ interaction modifies properties like the spin reorientation. Growth induced strain in thin films is another means to modify materials properties since the sign of strain affects the bond length and therefore directly the orbital interaction. Our study focuses on epitaxially grown (010) oriented DyFeO3 and LuFeO3 thin films, thereby investigating the impact of compressive lattice strain on the magnetically active Dy3+ and magnetically inactive Lu3+ compared to uniaxially strained single crystal DyFeO3. The DyFeO3 films exhibits a shift of more than 20K in spin-reorientation temperatures, maintain the antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4 phase of the Fe-lattice below the spin reorientation, and show double step hysteresis loops for both in-plane directions between 5 K and 390 K. This is the signature of an Fe-spin induced ferromagnetic Dy3+ lattice above the N\'eel temperature of the Dy. The observed shift in the film spin reorientation temperatures vs lattice strain is in good agreement with isostatic single crystal neutron diffraction experiments with a rate of 2 K/ kbar bar.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity production from fossil fuels is among the main contributors to global warming. To suppress climate change, energy-efficient systems, devices, and technologies must be implemented. This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical photoresponses of gated nanowire photoconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional photoconductors have extraordinarily high photoresponse and gain, which can be modulated by gate voltages as shown in literature. However, the physics of gate modulation remains elusive. In this work, we investigated the physics of gate modulation in silicon nanowire photoconductors with the analytical photoresponse equations. It was found that the impact of gate voltage varies vastly for nanowires with different size. For the wide nanowires that cannot be pinched off by high gate voltage, we found that the photoresponses are enhanced by at least one order of magnitude due to the gate-induced electric passivation. For narrow nanowires that starts with a pinched-off channel, the gate voltage has no electric passivation effect but increases the potential barrier between source and drain, resulting in a decrease in dark and photo current. For the nanowires with an intermediate size, the channel is continuous but can be pinched off by a high gate voltage. The photoresponsivity and photodetectivity is maximized during the transition from the continuous channel to the pinched-off one. This work provides important insights on how to design high-performance photoconductors.</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin polarization in lightly Cr-substituted layered antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>

Abstract: Tuning magnetic properties in layered magnets is an important route to realize novel phenomenon related to two-dimensional (2D) magnetism. Recently, tuning antiferromagnetic (AFM) properties through substitution and intercalation techniques have been widely studied in MPX3 compounds. Interesting phenomena, such as diverse AFM structures and even the signatures of ferrimagnetism, have been reported. However, long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the magnetic properties of the previously unreported Cr-substituted NiPS3. We found that Cr substitution is extremely efficient in controlling spin orientation in NiPS3. Our study reveals a field-induced spin polarization in lightly (9%) Cr-substituted NiPS3, which is likely attributed to the attenuation of AFM interactions and magnetic anisotropy due to Cr doping. Our work provides a possible strategy to achieve FM phase in AFM MPX3, which could be useful for investigating 2D magnetism as well as potential device applications.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Without External Magnetic Fields from Individual CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), the latest generation of colloidal QD family, exhibit outstanding optical properties which are now exploited as both classical and quantum light sources. Most of their rather exceptional properties are related to the peculiar exciton fine-structure of band-edge states which can support unique bright triplet excitons. The degeneracy of the bright triplet excitons is lifted with energetic splitting in the order of millielectronvolts, which can be resolved by the photoluminescence (PL) measurements of single QDs at cryogenic temperatures. Each bright exciton fine-structure-state (FSS) exhibits a dominantly linear polarization, in line with several theoretical models based on the sole crystal field, exchange interaction and shape anisotropy. Here, we show that in addition to a high degree of linear polarization, the individual exciton FSS can exhibit a non-negligible degree of circular polarization even without external magnetic fields by investigating the four Stokes parameters of the exciton fine-structure in individual CsPbBr3 QDs through Stokes polarimetric measurements. We observe a degree of circular polarization up to ~38%, which could not be detected by using the conventional polarimetric technique. In addition, we found a consistent transition from left- to right-hand circular polarization within the fine-structure triplet manifold, which was observed in magnetic field dependent experiments. Our optical investigation provides deeper insights into the nature of the exciton fine-structures and thereby drives the yet-incomplete understanding of the unique photophysical properties of this novel class of QDs, potentially opening new scenarios in chiral quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Band mixing in the quantum anomalous Hall regime of twisted semiconductor bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkable recent experiments have observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects at zero field and unusually high temperatures in twisted semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$. Intriguing observations in these experiments such as the absence of integer Hall effects at twist angles where a fractional Hall effect is observed, do however remain unexplained. The experimental phase diagram as a function of twist angle remains to be established. By comprehensive numerical study, we show that band mixing has large qualitative and quantitative effects on the energetics of competing states and their energy gaps throughout the twist angle range $\theta\leq 4^\circ$. This lays the ground for the detailed realistic study of a rich variety of strongly correlated twisted semiconductor multilayers and an understanding of the phase diagram of these fascinating systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Uncorrelated On-site Scalar Potential and Mass Disorder on Transport of Two-Dimensional Dirac Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of massive Dirac fermions subjected to uncorrelated scalar potential disorder, and mass disorder. Using a finite difference method, the conductance is calculated for a wide variety of combinations of these two disorder strengths. By calculating the scaling of conductivity with system size we find that, depending on the combination, the system can have an insulating, scale invariant, and metallic behavior. We identify the critical values of these disorder strengths where the phase transitions occur. We study both the zero and nonzero average mass cases to examine the effect of scalar potential disorder on band gap. Our results suggest a suppression of the band gap by the scalar potential disorder.</description>

      <title>Easy-to-configure zero-dimensional valley-chiral modes in a graphene point junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D materials can be manipulated for low-dissipation quantum electronics called valleytronics. At the boundary between two regions of bilayer graphene with different atomic or electrostatic configuration, valley-polarized current has been realized. However, the demanding fabrication and operation requirements limit device reproducibility and scalability toward more advanced valleytronics circuits. We demonstrate a new device architecture of a point junction where a valley-chiral 0D PN junction is easily configured, switchable, and capable of carrying valley current with an estimated polarization of ~80%. This work provides a new building block in manipulating valley quantum numbers and scalable valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Generation, manipulation and detection of snake state trajectories of a neutral atom in a ring-cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a set-up to create and detect the atomic counterpart of snake state trajectories which occur at the interface where the magnetic field reverses direction. Such a magnetic field is generated by coupling two counter-propagating modes of a ring cavity to a two-level atom. The spatial distribution and the strength of the induced magnetic field are controlled by the transverse mode profile of the cavity modes and the number of photons in the two modes, respectively. By analysing the atomic motion in such a magnetic field while including the cavity back-action, we find that the atom follows snake state trajectories which can be non-destructively detected and reconstructed from the phase and the intensity of the light field leaking from the cavity. We finally show that the system parameters can be tuned to modify the transport properties of the snake states and even amplify the effect of cavity feedback which can completely alter their topology.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area-Grown PbTe-Pb Planar Josephson Junctions for Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are predicted to host Majorana zero modes. The material platforms in previous studies are two dimensional electron gases (InAs, InSb, InAsSb and HgTe) coupled to a superconductor such as Al or Nb. Here, we introduce a new material platform for planar JJs, the PbTe-Pb hybrid. The semiconductor, PbTe, was grown as a thin film via selective area epitaxy. The Josephson junction was defined by a shadow wall during the deposition of the superconductor Pb. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a sharp semiconductor-superconductor interface. Gate-tunable supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections are observed. A perpendicular magnetic field causes interference patterns of the switching current, exhibiting Fraunhofer-like and SQUID-like behaviors. We further demonstrate a prototype device for Majorana detection, wherein phase bias and tunneling spectroscopy are applicable.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Stochastic Neurons Based on Strain Engineered Low Barrier Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are efficient hardware accelerators for solving a large variety of combinatorial optimization problems. "Binary" stochastic neurons (BSN) are those whose states fluctuate randomly between two levels +1 and -1, with the probability of being in either level determined by an external bias. "Analog" stochastic neurons (ASNs), in contrast, can assume any state between the two levels randomly (hence "analog") and can perform analog signal processing. They may be leveraged for such tasks as temporal sequence learning, processing and prediction. Both BSNs and ASNs can be used to build efficient and scalable neural networks. Both can be implemented with low (potential energy) barrier nanomagnets (LBMs) whose random magnetization orientations encode the binary or analog state variables. The difference between them is that the potential energy barrier in a BSN LBM, albeit low, is much higher than that in an ASN LBM. As a result, a BSN LBM has a clear double well potential profile, which makes its magnetization orientation assume one of two orientations at any time, resulting in the binary behavior. ASN nanomagnets, on the other hand, hardly have any energy barrier at all and hence lack the double well feature. That makes their magnetizations fluctuate in an analog fashion. Hence, one can reconfigure an ASN to a BSN, and vice-versa, by simply raising and lowering the energy barrier. If the LBM is magnetostrictive, then this can be done with local (electrically generated) strain. Such a reconfiguration capability heralds a powerful field programmable architecture for a p-computer, and the energy cost for this type of reconfiguration is miniscule.</description>
