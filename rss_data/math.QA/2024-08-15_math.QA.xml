      <title>Vertex operator expressions for Lie algebras of physical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lie algebra of physical states associated with certain vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. By applying the no-ghost theorem from string theory we express the corresponding Lie brackets in terms of vertex algebra operations. In the special case of the Moonshine module this result answers a question of Borcherds, posed in his paper on the Monstrous moonshine conjecture.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, I: Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this first of a series of two papers, we investigate two different equivalence relations obtained by generalizing the notion of genus of even lattices to the setting of vertex operator algebras (or two-dimensional chiral algebras). The bulk genus equivalence relation was defined in arXiv:math/0209333 and groups (suitably regular) vertex operator algebras according to their modular tensor category and central charge. Hyperbolic genus arXiv:2004.01441 tests isomorphy after tensoring with a hyperbolic plane vertex algebra. Physically, two rational chiral algebras are said to belong to the same bulk genus if they live on the boundary of the same 2+1d topological quantum field theory; they belong to the same hyperbolic genus if they can be related by current-current exactly marginal deformations after tensoring a non-chiral compact boson.
  As one main result, we prove the conjecture that the hyperbolic genus defines a finer equivalence relation than the bulk genus. This is based on a new, equivalent characterization of the hyperbolic genus that uses the maximal lattice inside a vertex operator algebra and its commutant (or coset).
  We discuss the implications of these constructions for the classification of rational conformal field theory. In particular, we propose a program for (partially) classifying $c=32$, holomorphic vertex operator algebras (or chiral conformal field theories), and obtain novel lower bounds, via a generalization of the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula, on the number of vertex operator algebras at higher central charges. Finally, we conjecture a Siegel-Weil identity which computes the "average" torus partition function of an ensemble of chiral conformal field theories defined by any hyperbolic genus, and interpret this formula physically in terms of disorder-averaged holography.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of automorphisms on the bosonic extension of arbitrary type and show that they satisfy the braid relations. They preserve the global basis and the crystal basis. Using this braid group action, we define a subalgebra for each positive braid word, which possesses the PBW type basis. As an application, we show that the tensor product decomposition of the positive bosonic extionsion,</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a negative definite plumbed three-manifold, we give an integral representation of the appropriate average of the GPPV invariants of Gukov--Pei--Putrov--Vafa, which implies that this average admits a resurgent asymptotic expansion, the leading term of which is the Costantino--Geer--Patureau-Mirand invariant of the three-manifold. This proves a conjecture of Costantino--Gukov--Putrov.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the quandle polynomial. We prove that our polynomial is an invariant of stuquandles. Furthermore, we use the invariant of stuquandles to define a polynomial invariant of stuck links. As a byproduct, we obtain a polynomial invariant of RNA foldings. Lastly, we provide explicit computations of our polynomial invariant for both stuck links and RNA foldings.</description>

      <title>A categorical interpretation of Morita equivalence for dynamical von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\G}{\mathbb{G}}\DeclareMathOperator{\Rep}{Rep} \DeclareMathOperator{\Corr}{Corr}$Let $\G$ be a locally compact quantum group and $(M, \alpha)$ a $\G$-$W^*$-algebra. The object of study of this paper is the $W^*$-category $\Rep^{\G}(M)$ of normal, unital $\G$-representations of $M$ on Hilbert spaces endowed with a unitary $\G$-representation. This category has a right action of the category $\Rep(\G)= \Rep^{\G}(\mathbb{C})$ for which it becomes a right $\Rep(\G)$-module $W^*$-category. Given another $\G$-$W^*$-algebra $(N, \beta)$, we denote the category of normal $*$-functors $\Rep^{\G}(N)\to \Rep^{\G}(M)$ compatible with the $\Rep(\G)$-module structure by $\operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ and we denote the category of $\G$-$M$-$N$-correspondences by $\operatorname{Corr}^{\G}(M,N)$. We prove that there are canonical functors $P: \Corr^{\G}(M,N)\to \operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ and $Q: \operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))\to \operatorname{Corr}^{\G}(M,N)$ such that $Q \circ P\cong \operatorname{id}.$ We use these functors to show that the $\G$-dynamical von Neumann algebras $(M, \alpha)$ and $(N, \beta)$ are equivariantly Morita equivalent if and only if $\Rep^{\G}(N)$ and $\Rep^{\G}(M)$ are equivalent as $\Rep(\G)$-module-$W^*$-categories. Specializing to the case where $\G$ is a compact quantum group, we prove that moreover $P\circ Q \cong \operatorname{id}$, so that the categories $\Corr^{\G}(M,N)$ and $\operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ are equivalent. This is an equivariant version of the Eilenberg-Watts theorem for actions of compact quantum groups on von Neumann algebras.</description>

Abstract: We define a monoidal category $\operatorname{\mathbf{W}}$ and a closely related 2-category $\operatorname{\mathbf{2Weyl}}$ using diagrammatic methods. We show that $\operatorname{\mathbf{2Weyl}}$ acts on the category $\mathbf{TL} :=\bigoplus_n \operatorname{TL}_n\operatorname{-mod}$ of modules over Temperley-Lieb algebras, with its generating 1-morphisms acting by induction and restriction. The Grothendieck groups of $\operatorname{\mathbf{W}}$ and a third category we define $\operatorname{\mathbf W}^\infty$ are closely related to the Weyl algebra. We formulate a sense in which $K_0(\operatorname{\mathbf W}^\infty)$ acts asymptotically on $K_0(\mathbf{TL})$.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove linear independence of the combinatorial spanning set for standard $C_\ell^{(1)}$-module $L(k\Lambda_0)$ by establishing a connection with the combinatorial basis of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspace $W(k\Lambda_0)$ of $C_{2\ell}^{(1)}$-module $L(k\Lambda_0)$. It should be noted that the proof of linear independence for the basis of $W(k\Lambda_0)$ is obtained by using simple currents and intertwining operators in the vertex operator algebra $L(k\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Compatible structures of operads by polarization, their Koszul duality and Manin products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic structures with multiple copies of a given type of operations interrelated by various compatibility conditions have long being studied in mathematics and mathematical physics. They are broadly referred as linearly compatible, matching, and totally compatible structures. This paper gives a unified approach to these structures in the context of operads. We first generalize the process of polarization for polynomials in invariant theory to the one for operads, leading to the general notion of linearly compatible operads. Refining the polarization by partitioning it into foliations, we obtain a notion of matching operads consolidating those appeared recently from applications of regularity structures, and Volterra integral equations. Distinguished among them is the leveled matching compatibility, which is unique with respect to a fix ordering of the vertices in tree monomials. Equating all matching compatibilities of a given operad leads to the totally compatible operad of this operad.
  For unary/binary quadratic operads, the linear compatibility and the total compatibility are in Koszul dual to each other, and there is a Koszul self-duality among the matching compatibilities. In particular, the leveled matching compatibility is Koszul self-dual. For binary quadratic operads, these three compatible operads can also be obtained by taking Manin black and white products. For some finitely generated binary quadratic operad, Koszulity is preserved under taking the compatibilities.</description>
