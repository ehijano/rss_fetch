      <title>Luminosity and Beam-Induced Background Studies for the Cool Copper Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-energy electron-positron collider has been widely recognized by the particle physics community to be the next crucial step for detailed studies of the Higgs boson and other fundamental particles and processes. Several proposals for such colliders, either linear or circular, are currently under evaluation. Any such collider will be required to reach high lumimosities, in order to collect enough data at a reasonable time scale, while at the same time coping with high rates of background particles produced from beam-beam interactions during the collisions. In this paper, we analyze the luminosity and beam-beam interaction characteristics of the Cool Copper Collider (C$^3$) and perform a comparison with other linear collider proposals. We conclude that C$^3$ can reach the same or higher collision rates as the other proposals, without having to cope with higher beam-induced background fluxes. Thus, C$^3$ emerges as an attractive option for a future electron-positron collider, benefiting from the collective advancements in beam delivery and final focus system technologies developed by other linear collider initiatives.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive cavity-based charge diagnostic for plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge contained in an electron bunch is one of the most important parameters in accelerator physics. Several techniques to measure the electron bunch charge exist. However, many conventional charge diagnostics face serious drawbacks when applied to plasma accelerators. For example, integrating current transformers (ICTs or toroids) have been shown to be sensitive to the electromagnetic pulses (EMP) originating from the plasma, whereas scintillating screens are sensitive to background radiation such as betatron radiation or bremsstrahlung and only allow for a destructive measurement of the bunch charge. We show measurements with a noninvasive, cavity-based charge diagnostic (the DaMon), which demonstrate its high sensitivity, high dynamic range and resistance towards EMP. The measurements are compared to both an ICT and an absolutely calibrated scintillating screen.</description>
