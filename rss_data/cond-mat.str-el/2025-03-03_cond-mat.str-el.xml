      <title>Duality viewpoint of noninvertible symmetry protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generalized symmetries have drawn significant attention to gapped phases of matter exhibiting novel symmetries, such as noninvertible symmetries. By leveraging the duality transformations, the classification and construction of gapped phases with noninvertible symmetry can be mapped to those involving conventional group symmetries. We demonstrate this approach by classifying symmetry-protected topological phases with a broad class of noninvertible symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our results reveal new classifications that extend beyond those based on group symmetries. Additionally, we construct lattice models in $(1+1)d$ and $(2+1)d$ that realize these new phases and explore their anomalous interfaces.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic tensor and hydrodynamics of altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>

      <title>Formation of Frustrated Charge Density Waves in Kagome Metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW), a translational symmetry breaking electronic liquid, plays a pivotal role in correlated quantum materials, such as high-T$_c$ superconductors and topological semimetals. Recently, CDWs that possibly intertwine with superconductivity and magnetism are observed in various kagome metals. However, the nature of CDWs and the role of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in these materials remain an unresolved challenge. In this letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a "yield sign"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly complete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2). The scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as decreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at Q$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short phase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first principles calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice interactions that are modulated by the FS topology. These results shed light on the interplay between FS and CDW in quantum materials with nearly degenerate structural deformation patterns.</description>

      <title>Order parameter fluctuation effects on current-induced magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of order parameter fluctuations on magnetoelectric effects in metallic systems using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on a a chiral quadrupole order in a distorted kagome lattice in a model incorporating conduction electrons and classical orbital moments. The ordered orbital moments break mirror symmetry and couple with the conduction electrons, leading to a current-induced magnetization driven by the quadrupole order. Our findings reveal that order parameter fluctuations significantly affect the current-induced magnetization, strongly suppressing the response over a broad temperature range below the transition temperature. Additionally, we analyze the influence of Fermi surface properties and associated matrix elements on this phenomenon. Our results highlight the crucial role of fluctuation effects, demonstrating a qualitatively distinct temperature dependence of the current-induced magnetization compared to that of the order parameter itself.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of Kondo-like behavior in the 3$d$-electron heavy-fermion compound YFe$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy fermion (HF) state of $d$-electron systems is of great current interest since it exhibits various exotic phases and phenomena that are reminiscent of the Kondo effect in $f$-electron HF systems. Here, we present a combined infrared spectroscopy and first-principles band structure calculation study of the $3d$-electron HF compound YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. The infrared response exhibits several charge-dynamical hallmarks of HF and a corresponding scaling behavior that resemble those of the $f$-electron HF systems. In particular, the low-temperature spectra reveal a dramatic narrowing of the Drude response along with the appearance of a hybridization gap ($\Delta \sim$ 50 meV) and a strongly enhanced quasiparticle effective mass. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the infrared response indicates a crossover around $T^{\ast} \sim$ 100 K from a coherent state at low temperature to a quasi-incoherent one at high temperature. Despite of these striking similarities, our band structure calculations suggest that the mechanism underlying the HF behavior in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is distinct from the Kondo scenario of the $f$-electron HF compounds and even from that of the $d$-electron iron-arsenide superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. For the latter, the HF state is driven by orbital-selective correlations due to a strong Hund's coupling. Instead, for YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ the HF behavior originates from the band flatness near the Fermi level induced by the combined effects of kinetic frustration from a destructive interference between the direct Fe-Fe and indirect Fe-Ge-Fe hoppings, band hybridization involving Fe $3d$ and Y $4d$ electrons, and electron correlations. This highlights that rather different mechanisms can be at the heart of the HF state in $d$-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Linear magnetoresistance, anomalous Hall effect and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in antiferromagnetic SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among magnetism, electron correlations, and complex electronic structures in rare-earth materials requires both high-quality single crystals and systematic investigation of their electronic properties. In this study, we have successfully grown a single crystal of SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ and investigated its anisotropic physical properties and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations through experimental and theoretical approaches. SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ crystallizes in the well known ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type tetragonal structure with lattice parameters, $a~=~4.226$~\AA~ and $c~=~11.051$~\AA. Electrical transport and magnetization measurements indicate that it is metallic and exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering below the N\'{e}el temperature, $T_{\rm N}$ = 9.2~K. SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ exhibits a linear non-saturating magnetoresistance, reaching $\sim 97$\% at $2$~K for applied magnetic field $B$~$\parallel~[001]$ and a significant anomalous Hall effect with an anomalous Hall angle of $0.10-0.14$. Additionally, magnetization measurements reveal dHvA quantum oscillations for magnetic fields greater than $8$~T. Our calculated electronic structure, quantum oscillations, and anomalous Hall effect in the canted antiferromagnetic state closely align with experimental results, underscoring the role of complex electronic structure and spin-canting-driven non-zero Berry curvature in elucidating the physical properties of SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$</description>

      <title>Hidden States and Dynamics of Fractional Fillings in tMoTe2 Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2). Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at v = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moir\'e unit cell). In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between v = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (v &gt; 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at v = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moir\'e conduction and valence bands.</description>

      <title>Large Seebeck coefficient driven by "pudding mold" flat band in hole-doped CuRhO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, of the metallic electronic structure of the hole-doped thermoelectric oxide CuRh$_{0.9}$Mg$_{0.1}$O$_2$. The material is found to have a ``pudding mold'' type band structure, with a nearly flat band edge located near the Fermi level, which is thought to be the origin of the thermoelectric behavior of this material. The experimental data match the density functional theory of the undoped parent compound, simply corrected by a rigid shift of the bands. Transport calculations based on the observed band structure yield a Seebeck coefficient of $\sim 200 \,\mu$V/K for the undoped parent material, consistent with experimental measurements. Our results show that CuRhO$_2$ is a textbook example of how pure band-structural effects can result in a large thermoelectric figure of merit, demonstrating that flat band edges in oxides are a realistic route for the efficient conversion of thermal energy.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of 2-spinon excitations in the doped 1D cuprate Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+{\delta}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent photoemission experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional Ba-based cuprates suggest that doped holes experience an attractive potential not captured using the simple Hubbard model. This observation has garnered significant attention due to its potential relevance to Cooper pair formation in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. To scrutinize this assertion, we examined signatures of such an attractive potential in doped 1D cuprates Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ by measuring the dispersion of the 2-spinon excitations using Cu $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). Upon doping, the 2-spinon excitations appear to weaken, with a shift of the minimal position corresponding to the nesting vector of the Fermi points, $q_F$. Notably, we find that the energy scale of the 2-spinons near the Brillouin zone boundary is substantially softened compared to that predicted by the Hubbard model in one-dimension. Such a discrepancy implies missing ingredients, which lends support for the presence of an additional attractive potential between holes.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through an $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen[1,2]. We measure the tunneling exponent $g = 0.334 \pm 0.001$, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the transformer density operator ansatz for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting steady states.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Broken Kondo Screening and Zero-Energy Mode in the Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.</description>

Abstract: Interplay of lattice, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom in complex oxide materials has hosted a plethora of exotic quantum phases and physical properties. Recent advances in synthesis of freestanding complex oxide membranes and twisted heterostructures assembled from membranes provide new opportunities for discovery using moir\'e design with local lattice control. To this end, we designed moir\'e crystals at the coincidence site lattice condition, providing commensurate structure within the moir\'e supercell arising from the multi-atom complex oxide unit cell. We fabricated such twisted bilayers from freestanding SrTiO3 membranes and used depth sectioning-based TEM methods to discover ordered charge states at the moir\'e interface. By selectively imaging SrTiO3 atomic planes at different depths through the bilayer, we clearly resolved the moir\'e periodic structure at the twisted interface and found that it exhibits lattice-dependent charge disproportionation in the local atomic registry within the moir\'e supercell. Our density-functional modelling of the twisted oxide interface predicts that these moir\'e phenomena are accompanied by the emergence of a two-dimensional flat band that can drive new electronic phases. Our work provides a novel guideline for controlling moir\'e periodicity in twisted oxides and opens pathways to exploit the new functionalities via moir\'e lattice-driven charge-orbital correlation.</description>

      <title>Is chiral supersymmetry emanant or emergent?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Majorana Nicolai model is one of the simplest models of supersymmetry realized on a fermionic chain in $1+1$ dimensions. Within a certain parameter region, the extended theory breaks the supersymmetry spontaneously, but it has a distinguished feature that the general counting rule of the Nambu-Goldstone mode does not apply: we observe twice as many low-energy degrees of freedom than the broken lattice symmetry. We argue that the extra degrees of freedom originate from the spontaneous breaking of the emergent chiral supersymmetry. This chiral supersymmetry becomes an emanant symmetry in the non-interacting limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the nontrivial thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional topological systems. For the Chern insulator, we show that the Seebeck coefficient is fully determined by the Kelvin formula, while the Nernst coefficient vanishes. For a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interactions we reveal how the Berry curvature affects the thermoelectric coefficients, and derive the Mott-like equation for thermopower. We predict a strong variation of the thermopower of a two-dimensional topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry in the ballistic and dissipative regimes. The Kelvin formula applies in the ballistic regime, while the Mott formula holds in the dissipative regime. Importantly, in a system with trapezoidal geometry, the combination of ballistic and dissipative regimes leads to the anomalous Nernst effect. Finally, we analyze a two-dimensional Anderson insulator, where edge modes show distinct temperature behavior of the Seebeck coefficient near the weak localization-strong localization transition temperatures. In the trivial phase, the thermopower exhibits a strong power law temperature dependence, while in the topological phase both power law and exponential dependences coexist.</description>

      <title>Atomically Modulating Competing Exchange Interactions in Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Hosts GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin states enabling high-density, low-power spin electronics. Despite growing efforts to find new skyrmion host systems, the microscopic mechanisms leading to skyrmion phase transitions at specific temperatures and magnetic fields remain elusive. Here, we systematically study the isostructural centrosymmetric magnets- GdRu2X2 (X = Si and Ge), and the role of X-p orbitals in modifying magnetic exchange interactions. GdRu2Ge2 single crystals, synthesized by arc melting, exhibit two high-entropy pockets associated with skyrmion phases at 0.9 T &lt; H &lt; 1.2 T and 1.3 T &lt; H &lt; 1.7 T, 2 K &lt; T &lt; 30 K-more accessible condition at lower fields and higher temperatures than that in the Si counterpart. Entropy estimations from heat capacity measurements align with magnetization data, and transport studies confirm a topological Hall effect, highlighting the system's nontrivial spin textures and Berry curvature. Compared to GdRu2Si2, electronic structure and exchange interaction evaluations reveal the more extended Ge-4p orbitals enhance competing exchange interactions in GdRu2Ge2, thereby manifesting the rich skyrmion behavior. This work demonstrates how modifying exchange interactions at the atomic level enables the tunability of topologically nontrivial electronic states while advancing our understanding of skyrmion formation mechanisms for future spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical mean-field calculations of the three-band Emery model at the one- and two-particle level for material-realistic parameters of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Our study shows that even within dynamical mean-field theory, which accounts solely for temporal fluctuations, the intrinsic multi-orbital nature of the Emery model introduces effective non-local correlations. These correlations lead to a non-Curie-like temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in the pseudogap regime. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the uniform static spin susceptibility obtained by single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we find indications of emerging oxygen-copper singlet fluctuations, explicitly captured by the model. Despite correctly describing the hallmark of the pseudogap at the two-particle level, such as the drop in the Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamical mean-field theory fails to capture the spectral properties of the pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Charge Dynamics of an Unconventional Three-Dimensional Charge Density Wave in Kagome FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal pronounced optical anisotropy along the $a$- and $c$-axis, as well as an unusual response associated with three-dimensional CDW order. Above $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$, there is a notable transfer of spectral weight (SW) from high to low energies, promoted by the magnetic splitting-induced shift in bands. Across the CDW transition, we observe a sudden SW transfer from low to high energies over a broad range, along with the emergence of new excitations around 1200 cm$^{-1}$. These results contrast with observations from other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs leads to a clear CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by a $2\times2\times2$ CDW ground state driven by a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, and charge order, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in FeGe.</description>

      <title>2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras and Domain Walls in 2+1D Topological Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalence. From a physical perspective, this is equivalent to providing a criterion for when different $E_2$ condensable algebras result in the same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon condensation process. By considering the left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$ and provide a method to recover $E_1$ condensable algebras from 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras. We also prove that intersecting Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$ with its left and right components generates all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper establishes a complete interplay between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$.
  The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated into their module categories, which correspond to domain walls in topological orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of domain walls. We also show that an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may lead to a nontrivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite groups. We also discuss examples beyond group symmetries. Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt-equivalent modular tensor categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the flat-band superconductivity in such a system. Additionally, we show that our results are robust even in the presence of a small amount of disorder. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. At the microscopic level, a generalized $\pi$-flux square lattice model with imbalance in the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions among spinless fermions between the nearest-neighbor sites gives rise to pseudospin-3/2 NH Dirac fermions in terms of internal, namely sublattice, degrees of freedom. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to the Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed.

      <description>arXiv:2409.03665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study by analytical and numerical means a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigenspectrum of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</description>
