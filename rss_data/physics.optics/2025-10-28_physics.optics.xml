      <title>Silica meta-optics: When high-performance does not need a high-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces -- planar arrays of subwavelength nanostructures -- are typically realized with high-index dielectrics, while low-index platforms are often dismissed for their weaker contrast. Here, we identify and experimentally verify regimes where a low-index platform (SiO$_2$) surpasses a high-index counterpart (TiO$_2$). We demonstrate that a low index suppresses higher-order Bloch modes, enabling the design of efficient devices with relaxed feature sizes. Low-index metasurfaces also offer two intrinsic advantages: a broad, well-behaved chromatic response without the need for explicit dispersion engineering, and strong tolerance to fabrication errors. We validate these features experimentally with silica metagratings, metalenses, and structured-light phase plates at $\lambda=632\ nm$. The metagratings reach $\geq$50% absolute diffraction efficiency over a $200\ nm$ bandwidth, the metalenses deliver 75% absolute diffraction efficiency with diffraction-limited performance, and the vortex phase plates achieve 80% conversion efficiency at the design wavelength and 60% with $100\ nm$ wavelength detuning. These results delineate conditions where low-index metasurfaces outperform high-index designs, suggesting a route to scalable, broadband, fabrication error-resilient flat optics.</description>

      <title>Zernike Mode Sorting with Vortex Phase Filters: Perfect Coronagraphs and Ideal Wavefront Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial mode sorting has come to prominence as an optical processing modality capable of saturating fundamental limits to numerous sensing tasks including wavefront sensing, coronagraphy, and superresolution imaging. But despite their promising theoretical advantages, contemporary mode sorters often feature large crosstalk, high loss, or sort modes that are poorly adapted to conventional imaging systems (e.g., Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss). Here, we introduce an alternative architecture that sorts spatial modes natural to circularly symmetric apertures: Zernike polynomials. Using conventional optics hardware and even-order vortex phase plates, we show how to assemble a series of vortex phase filters that can in principle separate the various Zernike polynomials losslessly and without crosstalk. This idea is demonstrated via application to wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, where we propose an optical system that saturates the quantum sensitivity limits to both tasks. We expect our work to prove useful for high-contrast imaging of extrasolar planets, improving both wavefront control and coronagraph performance.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Wannier equations: a real-time, real-space approach to the nonlinear optical response in crystals (ATATA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the semiconductor Wannier equations (SWEs), a real-time, real-space formulation of ultrafast light-matter dynamics in crystals, by deriving the equations of motion for the electronic reduced density matrix in a localized Wannier basis. Working in real space removes the structure-gauge ambiguities that hinder reciprocal-space semiconductor Bloch equations. Electron--electron interactions are included at the time-dependent Hartree plus static screened-exchange (TD-HSEX) level. Decoherence is modeled with three complementary channels: pure dephasing, population relaxation, and distance-dependent real-space dephasing; providing physically grounded damping for strong-field phenomena such as high-harmonic generation. Conceptually, the SWEs bridge real-space semiclassical intuition with many-body solid-state optics, offering a numerically robust and gauge-clean alternative to reciprocal-space approaches for nonlinear optical response and attosecond spectroscopy in solids.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling beyond the High-Q Limit and Linewidth Narrowing in a Multi-Exciton Planar Microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate unconventional linewidth narrowing and strong exciton-photon coupling in a planar hybrid microcavity (MC) with a low quality factor Q of around 300. As the broad photonic resonance approaches the heavy- and light-hole exciton transitions in GaAs quantum wells, three well-separated exciton-polariton branches emerge, accompanied by a counter-intuitive fourfold narrowing of the total linewidth. This behavior challenges conventional two-oscillator strong-coupling models and is only partially reproduced by transfer-matrix and Green's-function calculations, suggesting the involvement of frequency-dependent self-energies or correlated dissipation. Our findings demonstrate that strong coupling and coherence enhancement can occur even in highly lossy cavities, questioning the conventional requirement for high-Q microcavities and opening new design possibilities for polaritonic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Wavefront Corrections Using Beam Modulation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New experimental technique have been proposed to discuss the turbulence impact reduction using beam shaping technique. In first phase of experiments, turbulence Impacted Vortex beam shaping technique has been introduced for a propagating beam which is effected by Kolmogorov type lab based turbulence simulator using Pseudo Random Phase Plate (PRPP). The new technique is executed with a spatially filtered collimated Gaussian beam that is propagated through computer controlled rotating PRPP to introduce the lab based turbulence on the beam profile. The turbulence impacted beam is then propagated through Vortex Phase Plate (VPP) to shape that beam into different topological charged Laguerre Gaussian modes and further collimated using two lens based configuration. We have measured the scintillation index of the spatial intensity profile collected from CCD. Comparative studies have been done by placing the image plane in five different positions on the propagation path of the beam so that we can detect Collimated, diverging and converging outputs. Four topological charges of LG beams and Gaussian beam have been used to envisage results.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Inverse Design for Photonics via Integrated Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint-based inverse design yields compact, high-performance nanophotonic devices, but the mapping from pixel-level layouts to optical figures of merit remains hard to interpret. We present a simple pipeline that (i) generates a large set of wavelength demultiplexers (WDMs) with SPINS-B, (ii) records each final 2D layout and its spectral metrics (e.g., transmitted power at 1310 nm and 1550 nm), and (iii) trains a lightweight convolutional surrogate to predict these metrics from layouts, enabling (iv) gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients (IG) to highlight specific regions most responsible for performance. On a corpus of sampled WDMs, IG saliency consistently localizes to physically meaningful features (e.g., tapers and splitter hubs), offering design intuition that complements adjoint optimization. Our contribution is an end-to-end, data-driven workflow--SPINS-B dataset, CNN surrogate, and IG analysis--that turns inverse-designed layouts into interpretable attributions without modifying the physics solver or objective, and that can be reused for other photonic components.</description>

      <title>Giant Cotton-Mouton effect of suspensions of iron nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cotton-Mouton (CM) effect, referring to linear birefringence induced by a magnetic field, is usually very weak in natural materials. We propose theoretically that a giant CM effect may be achieved in the THz region with the suspension of iron nanorods. The unusual effect stems from the dual nature of the iron nanorods, which exhibit both ferromagnetic and plasmonic characteristics. Our results suggest that, with an ultralow magnetic field of 20 mT, a large linear birefringence up to 0.10 can be realized. The CM coefficient attains 2.2*10 7 T-2m-1, four orders of magnitude larger than that obtained currently in optical range. The results may advance the study and applications of the THz CM effect in artificial magneto-optic materials.</description>

      <title>Beam shaping techniques for pulsed laser ablation in liquids: Unlocking tunable control of nanoparticle synthesis in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle synthesis via pulsed laser ablation in liquids has gained prominence as a versatile and environmentally friendly approach for producing ligand-free colloids with controlled composition, size, and morphology. While pulsed laser ablation in liquids offers unparalleled advantages in terms of nanoparticle purity and material versatility, enhancing the size control and productivity require modifications of the standard pulsed laser ablation in liquid technique such as the incorporation of beam shaping techniques. Recent developments in spatial and temporal beam shaping have demonstrated their potential to revolutionize pulsed laser ablation in liquids by enabling more precise energy deposition and modified nanoparticle production dynamics. This review highlights the critical role of beam shaping, encompassing spatial shaping of the beam to influence laser-material interaction, and temporal modification to optimize pulse duration and energy delivery. The current advancements in beam shaping techniques, their impact on the nanoparticle characteristics, and their broader implications for scaling pulsed laser ablation in liquids to meet industrial demands are highlighted, offering a comprehensive perspective on the future of this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Tunable narrowband THz generation in the organic crystal BNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of tunable narrowband pulses is increasingly being pursued in terahertz science, for example to study the nonlinear response of individual modes of solids and molecules. Here, we extend the chirp-and-delay method to achieve collinear phase-matched difference-frequency generation in the organic crystal N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA-S), which results in tunable narrowband terahertz pulses. In this configuration, the fundamental frequency of a Ti:sapphire amplifier is used - eliminating the need for optical parametric amplifiers typically required for THz generation in other organic crystals. Chirped-pulse excitation suppresses multiphoton absorption in BNA, improving stability and extending crystal lifetime. The source delivers THz transients tunable from 0.25 THz to 2.1 THz with adjustable spectral width.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical behavior of confined electrons under torsion and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior. This work highlights the potential of geometric and topological engineering in low-dimensional systems to control and enhance nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Coherent Perfect Absorption: Zero Reflection Without Linewidth Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent claims, we revisit how coherent perfect absorption (CPA) influences cavity and polaritonic linewidths. Using standard input output theory and measurements on single port bare microwave cavities and cavity magnon hybrids, we find that CPA drives the on resonance reflection to zero while the spectral width remains set by the total decay rate. Apparent narrowing observed near CPA is found to be a visual artifact that does not remain upon quantitative analysis. Extending the analysis to cavity magnomechanics, we show that logarithmic plots can exhibit apparent polaromechanical normal mode splitting, whereas linear scale spectra display no true splitting. These results clarify when CPA modifies amplitudes versus spectral poles, offer practical guidance for data presentation, and indicate that CPA alone is not a route to linewidth suppression or polaromechanical mode splitting in the linear, weak-probe regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Digital Synthetic Wavelength Optical Absolute Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of optical range and time-of-flight are crucial for a variety of high-precision technologies. Competitive optical measurement techniques have been developed that balance precision with accuracy and system complexity. Here, we present a continuous-wave synthetic wavelength interferometry technique that employs digitally tunable electro-optic frequency combs. With a software-defined radio, our approach can dynamically sweep the synthetic wavelength and measure absolute optical range. We demonstrate this digital approach over a free-space optical delay line of 1 m and over an 40 km fiber link. The best obtained precision over the delay line is better than 60 nm (0.2 fs). Through a 40 km fiber spool, this precision degrades to 15 um (50 fs), which is a fractional error on the order of 2e-10 m/m. Our design is simple to implement, and only relies on continuous-wave interference, decreasing system complexity.</description>

      <title>All-photonic W-band terahertz receiver based on THz-to-optical carrier conversion with soliton microcomb dual carriers for high-speed OOK wireless transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-photonic terahertz receiver for a data-modulated signal, targeting a 106-GHz, 2.97-Gb/s OOK link. The scheme employs dual-wavelength optical carriers referenced to a soliton microcomb and performs THz-to-optical carrier conversion via nonpolarimetric electro-optic downconversion using an electro-optic polymer modulator. RF spectra and eye diagrams confirmed error-free transmission with a Q-factor of 5.78 and a bit-error rate of 3.73 x 10^-9, well below the hard-decision forward-error-correction (HD-FEC) threshold (Q = 2.67, BER = 3.8 x 10^-3). Comparative measurements using a single-wavelength optical-carrier configuration clearly revealed the superior signal-to-noise performance of the dual-wavelength scheme. System-level modeling further indicated scalability of the transmission distance beyond 100 m. These results establish soliton microcomb-referenced dual carriers as a promising platform for compact, integrated receivers enabling seamless wireless-optical convergence in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>UC2-ESP: A General-Purpose Framework for Open-Source Microscopy Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building the optical setup for investigating biological questions comes with challenges. A major such challenge is setting up and synchronizing the control of multiple hardware components such as stages, cameras and lasers. With UC2-ESP we present a compact electronics system powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to provide general-purpose control for various components in microscopy setups. Our system can interface with stepper motors, directed current (DC) motors, lasers (transistor-transistor logics, TTL or pulse width modulation, PWM), light emitting diodes (LEDs), and analog voltage outputs (galvo mirrors, led current control), allowing precise control over microscopy hardware. The platform is highly flexible, supporting custom pin configurations and multiple communication interfaces such as Bluetooth, universal serial bus (USB-serial), and HTTP via a built-in Webserver. A PlayStation controller can be used for haptic hardware manipulation, while commands are transmitted in a human-readable JSON format to ensure modularity and extensibility. The firmware is designed to receive parameters and execute actions dynamically, supporting complex control loops such as motor homing, stage scanning and temperature regulation via integrated controllers. Furthermore, the system integrates seamlessly with ImSwitch as well as MicroManager and offers a browser-based control tool using Web Serial. This open-source firmware enables microscopy research groups to develop custom setups and expand functionality efficiently, at low cost and high flexibility.</description>

      <title>Single mode lasing and spectral narrowing in photonic crystal line-defect cavities via spatially selected Bloch modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-efficiency and miniaturized on-chip light sources drives continuous innovation in photonic crystal (PhC) microcavity lasers. The presence of slow-light effects in PhC microcavities leads to the mode competition between Bloch modes resulting in multi-mode lasing, which obstructs the dense integration of PhC lasers. Here, we theoretically verify a technical scheme for the single-mode lasing of PhC line-defect-cavity lasers by spatially pumping a certain Bloch mode via optical interference.We demonstrate the capability to select a specific longitudinal mode to lase with a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) exceeding 30 dB. The interaction between optical interference fringes and the vacuum electromagnetic field inside the PhC cavity improves the linewidth and noise characteristics of lasers. This scheme of Bloch mode selection provides a novel and viable tool for the manipulation of PhC microcavity lasers.</description>

      <title>Automated control strategy for setting and stabilization of photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Wheatstone bridge configuration for enabling real-time and closed-loop stabilization and calibration of photonic devices integrated on chip. The measurement of the optical power propagating in a waveguide is achieved by leveraging the photo-thermal resistance variation of one of the resistors that comprise a bridge, which is either part of the waveguide or in close contact with the waveguide. The voltage generated by a monitor is applied through a processing unit to preceding actuators with a view to locking a system at the desired signal level. As all the "resistors" consisting of the Wheatstone bridge are placed on a single material platform in proximity to each other, the bridge is insensitive to temperature variations. Consequently, it functions exclusively as a monitor for the optical power propagating in a waveguide. Due to the high sensitivity of the monitor, automatic re-tuning of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be achieved with a recovery time defined by the material properties of the bridge "resistor". The material platform and arrangement can be implemented for both monitoring and activating the actuators, which makes the proposed system an attractive candidate for closed-loop control of optical devices. Furthermore, in contradistinction to the majority of monitors and photodetectors, which provide electrical current as an outcome of measuring an optical signal, the proposed circuit provides voltage, thereby eradicating the necessity to convert current to voltage at a later stage. This serves to firstly streamline the entire circuit and secondly contribute to a substantial diminution in the noise level in the circuit.</description>

      <title>Photon-starved imaging through turbulence at the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving diffraction-limited resolution through atmospheric turbulence is a fundamental challenge for ground-based imaging systems, especially in the photon-starved regime. Conventional methods, such as adaptive optics and speckle imaging, struggle to achieve optimal performance when turbulence is severe and photons are limited. We present Turbulence-Aware Poisson Blind Deconvolution (TAP-BD), a framework designed for robust image recovery in these extreme conditions. TAP-BD exploits phase modulations on the incoming photons coupled with physics-informed optimization to extract more information from the available signal than traditional methods. Experimentally, our approach achieves a target PSNR of 24 dB with just tens of noisy measurements, under severe turbulence up to D/r0~24. This robust performance in photon-starved conditions unlocks new capabilities in space situational awareness and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Chiral bound states in the continuum: a higher-order singularity for on-chip control of quantum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a fully integrable and reconfigurable platform for controlling quantum emission by harnessing chiral bound states in the continuum (BICs) as a higher-order non-Hermitian singularity. Our architecture employs dual-microring resonators evanescently coupled to two waveguides, supporting symmetry-protected BICs. By integrating an integrated reflector coupled with one resonator as a unidirectional feedback, a pair of orthogonal BICs gets transformed into a single, chiral BIC residing on an exceptional surface. The phase terms in external coupling and inter-modal coupling serve as two independent tuning knobs, enabling unprecedented dynamic control over the spontaneous emission dynamics of individual quantum emitters, including the Purcell enhancement and the emission lineshape. The efficiency in reconfiguring the output intensity gets promoted by more than a factor of two compared to alternative schemes, offering a promising path toward high-speed quantum optical switches and active lifetime control in integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus Classical Descriptions of Spontaneous Emission in Nanophotonic Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that quantum and classical descriptions generally yield different results for the spontaneous emission in nanophotonic cavities. Starting from the quantized single-mode field in a general context of dispersive and lossy cavities, we derive the expression for emission rate enhancement as well as key relevant parameters such as mode volume and quality factor. For general nanophotonic cavities, this ratio of the quantum to the classical description is typically below unity and varies with the material dispersion properties, scattering-to-absorption ratio and morphology of the cavity. Notably, the two descriptions converge for lossless, non-dispersive dielectric cavities and for noble-metal plasmonic cavities with sufficiently low scattering losses.</description>

      <title>Coherent all-optical tuning of large-area phase-gradient metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable active metasurfaces have become a major research focus in recent years. Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because it requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy, interference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in ultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces, coherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a single Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality. Here we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables large-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to tune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search algorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using this principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface for continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same framework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics, including varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and related dynamic focusing elements.</description>

      <title>Mismatch reconstruction theory for unknown measurement matrix in imaging through multimode fiber bending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms. This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance. The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory. The code is available: https://github.com/yanglebupt/mismatch-solution.</description>

      <title>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Generation and Detection of Hyperentangled Bell States at an Ultra-High Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate both the generation and detection of an ultra-high flux of polarization Bell states using broadband hyper-entangled bi-photons that are quantum-correlated in both polarization and time-energy. Bell states of polarization embody the most basic form of two-state entanglement, and are a key component of quantum protocols of communication and sensing. High-speed generation, processing and detection of polarization Bell-states is therefore critical for quantum technology. However, all current protocols that employ polarization entangled photons are inherently slow, primarily due to the photo-detectors (Photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photo-diodes, etc.) that can handle only $10^{6-7}$ photons/s, whereas sources may easily produce $10^{10-13}$ photons/s or more (if properly designed). We fully alleviate this detection bottleneck by resorting to physical detection of the bi-photons with nonlinear interferometry. We harness a generalized, dual polarization SU1,1 interferometer to generate, manipulate \textit{and measure} all the triplet Bell-states at a flux of $\sim\!5\times10^{11}$ photons/s, enhancing the speed of quantum processing by &gt;5 orders of magnitude compared to standard methods.</description>

      <title>Deterministic single-photon source with on-chip 5.6 GHz acoustic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Control of Valence Electron Motion in Xe Cation Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussians envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>

      <title>Spoofing resilience for simple-detection quantum illumination LIDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection and range finding using a weak light source is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks by an intruder. Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.</description>

Abstract: Electrical control of light in integrated photonics is central to a wide range of research and applications. It is conventionally achieved with thermo-optic tuning, but this suffers from high energy consumption and crosstalk. Nanoelectromechanical photonics could resolve these issues, but integrating this technology with conventional multilayer metal architectures is challenging, and conventional approaches do not allow crossings of electrical wires and photonic waveguides. Here, we use topology optimization to devise a single-layer electronic-photonic circuit crossing with up to 99.8 % optical transmission across a 20 nm electrical isolation trench. We focus our experiments on 100 nm trenches and measure an average transmission of 92.9 % over a 100 nm bandwidth, in excellent agreement with theory. We use these concepts to demonstrate a monolithic silicon nanoelectromechanical add-drop switch in which the flow of photons, electrons, and mechanical motions are fully integrated within the same layer. Our work addresses an important challenge in incorporating opto-electro-mechanical topologies into photonic integrated circuits and may lead to new functionalities in nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems, optomechanics, and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

Abstract: At resonance, the optical response of a homogeneous medium to incident light is governed by temporal dispersion, which induces changes in the refractive index (RI). However, recent experimental results reveal RI enhancements exceeding the fundamental limit of 5 in spatially confined systems. Herein, we study the off-resonance enhancement of RI in sub-5 nm gold nanoparticles using electronic light scattering (ELS). We discuss that the RI driven by the distribution and dynamics of excited-state charge-carriers can be locally boosted through the breaking of spatial symmetry in matter. These findings are critical for optically probing RI variations in spatially confined media using ELS.</description>

      <title>Loss-driven gain enhancements driven by topological singularities in non-Hermitian photonic crystals defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that purely lossy defects in one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic crystals can induce transmission matrix singularities not accessible with lossless defects. These singularities in turn can enable dramatic enhancement in overall system gain not accessible through conventional means. We further show that the underlying mechanism behind the loss-induced gain enhancement is due to the resonances being located specifically at topological branch cut singularities in the reflection coefficient with nontrivial winding numbers. The resulting resonances can exhibit exceptionally high quality factors in excess of $\sim 10^4$. Our work highlights the counterintuitive role of loss in engineering singularities in the gain response in non-Hermitian systems and its connection to topological phenomena in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable absorption spectrum splitting in a pulse-driven three-level system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a two-level system is driven on resonance by a strong incident field, its emission spectrum is characterized by the well-known Mollow triplet. If the absorption from the excited state, in this continuously driven two-level system, to a third, higher energy level, is probed by a weak field, the resulting absorption spectrum features the Autler-Townes doublet with two peaks separated by the Rabi frequency of the strong driving field. It has been shown that when the two-level system is instead driven by a periodic pulse sequence, the emission spectrum obtained has similarities with the Mollow triplet even though the system is only driven during the short application time of the pulses and is allowed to evolve freely between pulses. Here, we evaluate the absorption spectrum of the three-level system in the ladder/cascade configuration when the bottom two levels are driven by a periodic pulse sequence while the transition between the middle and the highest level is probed by a weak field. The absorption spectrum displays similarities with the Autler-Townes doublet with frequency separation between the main peaks defined by the inter-pulse delay. In addition, this spectrum shows little dependence on the pulse carrier frequency. These results demonstrate the capacity to modulate the absorption spectrum of a three-level system with experimentally achievable pulse protocols.</description>

      <title>Image formation theory of optical coherence tomography with optical aberrations and its application for computational aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational corrections of defocus and aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers a promising approach to realize high-resolution imaging with deep imaging depth, but without additional high hardware costs. However, these techniques are not well understood owing to a lack of accurate theoretical models and investigation tools. The image formation theory for OCT with optical aberrations is thus formulated here. Based on this theory, a numerical simulation method is developed, and computational refocusing and computational aberration correction (CAC) methods are designed. The CAC method based on the image formation theory is applied to simulated OCT signals and OCT images of a microparticle phantom and an in vivo human retina for simultaneous multi-depth correction of systematic aberration. The numerical simulation under the effective numerical aperture of 0.2 and 1.05 um central wavelength shows that the proposed method can obtain the Strehl ratios of more than 0.8 over a $\pm$ 100 um defocus range, while the conventional method cannot achieve this under the simulated conditions. Imaging results show that the CAC method designed based on the image formation theory can correct optical aberrations and improve the image quality more than the conventional CAC method. The proposed method improved the frequency component corresponding to the density of cone photoreceptors in OCT photoreceptor images by 1.2 to 1.4 times under the multi-depth correction. This theoretical model-based approach provides a powerful aid for understanding OCT imaging properties and processing method design.</description>

      <title>Revisiting PSF models: unifying framework and high-performance implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization microscopy often relies on detailed models of point spread functions. For applications such as deconvolution or PSF engineering, accurate models for light propagation in imaging systems with high numerical aperture are required. Different models have been proposed based on 2D Fourier transforms or 1D Bessel integrals. The most precise ones combine a vectorial description of the electric field and precise aberration models. However, it may be unclear which model to choose, as there is no comprehensive comparison between the Fourier and Bessel approaches yet. Moreover, many existing libraries are written in Java (e.g. our previous PSF generator software) or MATLAB, which hinders the integration into deep learning algorithms. In this work, we start from the original Richards-Wolf integral and revisit both approaches in a systematic way. We present a unifying framework in which we prove the equivalence between the Fourier and Bessel strategies and detail a variety of correction factors applicable to both of them. Then, we provide a high-performance implementation of our theoretical framework in the form of an open-source library that is built on top of PyTorch, a popular library for deep learning. It enables us to benchmark the accuracy and computational speed of different models, thus allowing for an in-depth comparison of the existing models for the first time. We show that the Bessel strategy is optimal for axisymmetric beams while the Fourier approach can be applied to more general scenarios. Our work enables efficient PSF computation on CPU or GPU, which can then be included in simulation and optimization pipelines.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles</title>

Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fields Formulation for Electromagnetic Waves Confined in Dielectric Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an easy-to-implement numerical method for analyzing electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric rings. Our approach employs a finite-difference-based solver in cylindrical coordinates, solving a mixed electric-magnetic field formulation to accurately enforce boundary conditions and compute resonant modes. The method avoids geometric transformations; instead, it directly discretizes the Helmholtz wave equation in cylindrical coordinates and solves the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem. We validate our model against commercial solvers for various structures, including a Si3N4 ring embedded in SiO2, a ring on a thin-film-coated substrate, and a torus, achieving agreement in effective refractive indices within 0.3%. The formulation accurately captures field confinement, curvature effects, and dispersion, enabling precise determination of propagation constants and mode profiles. As an application, we model optical frequency comb generation in a high-Q microresonator, predicting a free spectral range of 99.6 GHz and a loaded quality factor of 1.6 million, corroborated by experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric chirp transfer to high-energy ultraviolet pulses via gas-based chirped four-wave mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectro-temporal shaping of high-power femtosecond ultraviolet (UV) pulses remains a key challenge in ultrafast optics. Tailoring high-energy, ultrashort UV pulses underpins applications in ultrafast dynamics, high-precision spectroscopy, strong-field physics, charged-particle radiation sources, and industrial microfabrication. However, the transmission and damage threshold of the dielectric optics limit programmable shaping for high-power UV pulses. Towards overcoming this challenge, we demonstrate an antisymmetric dispersion transfer from near-infrared (NIR) pulses to UV pulses via chirped four-wave mixing (CFWM) in noble gas, whereby negatively chirped NIR pulses map quasi-linearly to positively chirped UV in a gas-filled hollow capillary fiber (HCF) at the expense of a moderate conversion efficiency of 13%. This antisymmetric chirp transfer approach broadens the basis for tailoring UV pulses by leveraging the high damage tolerance, large bandwidth acceptance, and intrinsically low dispersion of noble gases, rather than relying on conventional nonlinear crystals.</description>

Abstract: Spin lasers leverage electron spin-polarisation to control photon polarisation, offering the potential for lower thresholds, rapid modulation, and all-optical data processing. We report successful spin injection into a commercial Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) using optical pumping at wavelengths of 794 nm and 810 nm. Maximum circular polarisation achieved was about 20% at 794 nm, whereas this falls to 5% with exciting at 810 nm. We attribute this to reduced spin injection due to the longer excitation wavelength in line with previous measurements on quantum wells under optical orientation. We extend the Spin-Flip Model (SFM) to account for realistic excitation conditions and find our theoretical analysis accurately reproduces experimental trends.</description>

Abstract: Nanoparticles are ubiquitous, and methods that reveal insights into single-particle properties are highly desired to enable their advanced characterization. Techniques that achieve label-free single-nanoparticle detection often lack bandwidth or do not provide quantitative information. Here, we present a cavity-based dispersive sensing method that achieves a high bandwidth to capture all relevant timescales of translational diffusion, and a sensitivity to detect and size single particles with diameters down to 3 nm. We develop an analytical model describing the autocorrelation function for particle diffusion in a standing-wave sensing geometry and propose a method to address the challenges posed by the transient nature of single-particle signals. With this, we achieve quantitative particle sizing with high precision and accuracy, and provide an important tool to analyze single-particle diffusion.</description>

      <title>Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Optical interconnects are the most promising solution to address the data-movement bottleneck in data centers. Silicon microdisks, benefiting from their compact footprint, low energy consumption, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capability, have emerged as an attractive and scalable platform for optical modulation. However, microdisk resonators inherently exhibit low fabrication error tolerance, limiting their practical deployment. Here, utilizing a CMOS photonics platform, we demonstrate 1.2 Tb/s of off-die bandwidth through a 64 microdisk modulator system. In addition, we develop an automated, close-looped, non-reversible, low-loss, and picometer-precision permanent wavelength tuning technique using laser trimming. The trimming technique reduces 33 % of the energy consumption needed to thermally tune the microdisk resonant wavelength. Using this technique, we achieve a fully passive, 5-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM, 50 GHz spacing) transmitter. The integration of the high speed (1.2 Tb/s), low energy consumption (29 fJ/bit) and the permanent wavelength trimming lays a robust foundation for next-generation optical interconnect systems, poised to facilitate scaling of future AI and computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-Diffracting Beams for Resilient Near-Field Millimeter-Wave Communications A Quantitative Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu) under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture. Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.</description>

Abstract: Soliton dynamics in coupled Kerr microcavities is an important aspect of frequency comb technologies, with applications in optical communication and precision metrology. We investigate a minimal system consisting of two nearly identical coupled Kerr microresonators, each operating in the soliton regime and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and stability. Numerical simulations indicate that asymmetric perturbations can alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings highlight previously unexplored regimes of dissipative soliton organization and suggest new strategies for controlling soliton ensembles in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study coherent light scattering from linear crystals with up to twelve $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, acting as single photon emitters. Light-scattering is induced by two-photon laser excitation, starting from the S$_{1/2}\rightarrow$ D$_{5/2}$ quadrupole transition at 729~nm followed by the D$_{5/2}\rightarrow$ P$_{3/2}$ dipole transition at 854~nm, from where the ions decay back to the S$_{1/2}$ ground state via emission of a photon near 393~nm. We realize spin-selective excitation from the Zeeman-split ground states S$_{1/2}$, m$= \pm 1/2$, of the $\text{Ca}^+$ ions and observe in the far field spin-dependent interference patterns displaying the spin textures of the ion crystals. We investigate their dynamics by measuring the temporal evolution of the spatial Fourier frequencies of the observed patterns.</description>

      <title>Quantum matched filtering: breaking time-energy separability by 12 orders of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of signals buried in noise is the major challenge for sensing. Classically, the optimal detector is a matched filter, whose sensitivity meets the classical limit of correlation between the filter target and the measured signal within the noise. For classical signals, the correlation is limited by the separability criterion in frequency-time. Quantum states, however are not necessarily separable, and the correlation between entangled particles can surpass the classical limits. Specifically, time-energy entangled photons can be simultaneously correlated in time difference and frequency sum with no minimum limit, potentially leading to a drastic enhancement of sensitivity for diversified sensing applications. Yet, to enjoy this quantum enhancement, a unique, global detector is needed that can recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot, i.e. measure the combined correlated variables of time-difference and frequency-sum without measuring the individual frequencies or times. Such a global measurement could, in principle, be realized using the reverse disentangling interaction, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level have long been prohibitively inefficient, significantly restricting practical implementations. Here we overcome this barrier: We measure simultaneously and efficiently both the frequency-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (relative group delay/dispersion) by stimulating the SFG recombination with a strong pump. We generate biphotons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty of time-difference and frequency-sum that violates the classical separability bound by &gt;12 orders of magnitude. Our experiment and supporting theory pave the way for quantum sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar).</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.</description>

      <title>Strongly chirped dissipative solitons in normal and anomalous dispersion regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an adiabatic theory for strongly chirped dissipative solitons governed by the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and analyze their existence regions in both normal- and anomalous-dispersion regimes. Closed-form expressions for the spectrum, peak power, and energy allow a compact dimensionless parameterization of the dissipative soliton parametric space. The analysis reveals that dissipative-soliton resonance, i.e., chirp-driven temporal stretching with bounded peak power, naturally emerges on the scalable branch, providing a direct pathway to high-energy femtosecond oscillators without the need for external amplification. We establish a basis for interpreting these results within a thermodynamic framework that connects energy ``condensation'' in the soliton to a BEC-like metaphor, providing quantitative indicators for energy scalability limits and breakup onsets, and aligning with a recently formulated thermodynamic methodology for dissipative solitons. Beyond immediate laser design guidance, our approach suggests a generalized thermodynamic theory of strongly chirped dissipative solitons, including measurable entropy/temperature proxies and a phase diagram that delineates single- versus multi-soliton states. This unifies practical laser-engineering criteria with many-body concepts, pointing to optics-based, metaphorical simulations of condensate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.</description>

      <title>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as a new approach in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where strong-coupled magnon-photon modes can be achieved using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilization of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its experimental feasibility and wide generality as manifested in hematite.</description>

      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach for spatial super-resolution of heterodyne wind lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wind speed measurements using heterodyne lidars are limited in spatial resolution because of the current signal processing methods. This limit is equal to c $\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\tau$ is the laser pulse duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns: backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>
