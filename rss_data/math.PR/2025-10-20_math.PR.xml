      <title>Central limit theorem for the sine-$\beta$ point process at $\beta \le 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the analogue of the Soshnikov Central Limit Theorem for the sine-$\beta$ process at $\beta \le 2$. We consider regularized additive functionals, which correspond to 1-Sobolev regular functions $f(x/R)$, in the limit $R\to\infty$. Their convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric at the rate $(\ln R)^{-1/2}$ is established.
  The proof is based on the convergence of the circular $\beta$-ensemble to the sine-$\beta$ process, which was shown by Killip and Stoiciu. We find a convenient bound for the Laplace transforms of additive functionals under the circular $\beta$-ensemble, which holds under the scaling limit, suggested by Killip and Stoiciu. Further, we show that the additive functionals under the circular $\beta$-ensemble with $n$ particles converge to the gaussian distribution as $n\to\infty$ for all $1/2$-Sobolev regular functions for $\beta\le 2$, as was conjectured by Lambert.
  Finally, in order to prove the limit theorem for the circular $\beta$-ensemble we derive the connection between expectations of multiplicative functionals and the Jack measures, which generalizes the connection between the circular unitary ensemble and the Schur measures given by Gessel's theorem.</description>

      <title>A simple lemma concerning the Doeblin minorization condition and its applications to limit theorems for inhomogeneous Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we provide an elementary proof that a certain type of nonuniform sequential Doeblin minorization condition implies non-uniform sequential "geometric" ergodicity. Using this result several limit theorems for inhomogeneous Markov chains follow immediately from existing results [7,8,12]. We then focus our attention to Markov chains in random dynamical environment and deduce effective mixing rates which imply limit theorems for such processes by using the methods of [16] (which were formulated in a dynamical setup). The crucial part of the proof is to obtain effective convergence rates towards the random equivariant distribution, which has its own interest and yields, for instance, effective mixing times estimates together with results for the corresponding skew products</description>

      <title>On the short-time behaviour of up-and-in barrier options using Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the short-maturity asymptotics of up-and-in barrier options under a broad class of stochastic volatility models. Our approach uses Malliavin calculus techniques, typically used for linear stochastic partial differential equations, to analyse the law of the supremum of the log-price process. We derive a concentration inequality and explicit bounds on the density of the supremum in terms of the time to maturity. These results yield an upper bound on the asymptotic decay rate of up-and-in barrier option prices as maturity vanishes. We further demonstrate the applicability of our framework to the rough Bergomi model and validate the theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Martingale theory for Dynkin games with asymmetric information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of randomised stopping times to form a saddle point of a zero-sum Dynkin game with partial and/or asymmetric information across players. The framework is non-Markovian and covers essentially any information structure. Our methodology relies on the identification of suitable super and submartingales involving players' equilibrium payoffs. Saddle point strategies are characterised in terms of the dynamics of those equilibrium payoffs and are related to their Doob-Meyer decompositions.</description>

      <title>Spin glass analysis of the invariant distribution of a Lotka-Volterra SDE with a large random interaction matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Lotka-Volterra stochastic differential equation with a symmetric food interaction matrix is frequently used to model the dynamics of the abundances of the species living within an ecosystem when these interactions are mutualistic or competitive. In the relevant cases of interest, the Markov process described by this equation has an unique invariant distribution which has a Hamiltonian structure. Following an important trend in theoretical ecology, the interaction matrix is considered in this paper as a large random matrix. In this situation, the (conditional) invariant distribution takes the form of a random Gibbs measure that can be studied rigorously with the help of spin glass techniques issued from the field of physics of disordered systems. Considering that the interaction matrix is an additively deformed GOE matrix, which is a well-known model for this matrix in theoretical ecology, the free energy of the model is derived in the limit of the large number $n$ of species, making rigorous some recent results from the literature. The free energy analysis made in this paper could be adapted to other situations where the Gibbs measure is non compactly supported.</description>

      <title>On the moments of the volume for random convex chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be the triangle in the plane with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(0,1)$ and $(0, 1)$. The convex hull $T_n$ of points $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$ and $n$ independent random points uniformly distributed in $T$ is the random convex chain. In this paper we study the moments of the volume of random polytope $T_n$ and derive exact formulas for $k$-th moments for any integer $k\ge 0$. As an intermediate result, we find an explicit representation for the probability generating function of the number of vertices of $T_n$, from which an alternative formula for the probability that $T_n$ has $k$ vertices follows.</description>

      <title>Local Statistics of the $M_n$-Dimer Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical dimer model is concerned with the (weighted) enumeration of perfect matchings of a graph. An $n$-dimer cover is a multiset of edges that can be realized as the disjoint union of $n$ individual matchings. For a probability measure recently defined by Douglas, Kenyon, and Shi, which we call the $M_n$-dimer model, we study random $n$-dimer covers on bipartite graphs with matrix edge weights and produce formulas for local edge statistics and correlations. We also classify local moves that can be used to simplify the analysis of such graphs.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves and large deviations for 2D pure gravity deep water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves are extreme ocean events characterized by the sudden formation of anomalously large crests, and remain an important subject of investigation in oceanography and mathematics. A central problem is to quantify the probability of their formation under random Gaussian sea initial data. In this work, we rigorously characterize the tail probability for the formation of rogue waves of the pure gravity water wave equations in deep water, the most accurate quasilinear PDE modeling waves in open ocean. This large deviation result confirms various conjectures from the oceanography literature in the weakly nonlinear regime. Moreover, the result holds up to the optimal timescales allowed by deterministic well-posedness theory. The proof shows that rogue waves most likely arise through "dispersive focusing", where phase quasi-synchronization produces constructive amplification of the water crest. The main difficulty in justifying this mechanism is propagating statistical information over such long timescales, which we overcome by combining normal forms and probabilistic methods. Unlike prior work, this novel approach does not require approximate solutions to be Gaussian. Our general method tracks the tail probability of solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs with an integrable normal form and random Gaussian initial data, even in the absence of (quasi-)invariant measures.</description>

      <title>(Almost) Perfect Discrete Iterative Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete, iterative load balancing via matchings on arbitrary graphs. Initially each node holds a certain number of tokens, defining the load of the node, and the objective is to redistribute the tokens such that eventually each node has approximately the same number of tokens. We present results for a general class of simple local balancing schemes where the tokens are balanced via matchings. In each round the process averages the tokens of any two matched nodes. If the sum of their tokens is odd, the node to receive the one excess token is selected at random. Our class covers three popular models: in the matching model a new matching is generated randomly in each round, in the balancing circuit model a fixed sequence of matchings is applied periodically, and in the asynchronous model the load is balanced over a randomly chosen edge.
  We measure the quality of a load vector by its discrepancy, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum load across all nodes. As our main result we show that with high probability our discrete balancing scheme reaches a discrepancy of $3$ in a number of rounds which asymptotically matches the spectral bound for continuous load balancing with fractional load.
  This result improves and tightens a long line of previous works, by not only achieving a small constant discrepancy (instead of a non-explicit, large constant) but also holding for arbitrary instead of regular graphs. The result also demonstrates that in the general model we consider, discrete load balancing is no harder than continuous load balancing.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions in reducible state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary distributions and quasi-limiting behavior of Markov chains in general reducible state spaces with absorption. We propose a set of assumptions dealing with particular situations where the state space can be decomposed into three subsets between which communication is only possible in a single direction. These assumptions allow us to characterize the exponential order of magnitude and the exact polynomial correction, called polynomial convergence parameter, for the leading order term of the semigroup for large time. They also provide explicit convergence speeds to this leading order term. We apply these results to general Markov chains with finitely or denumerably many communication classes using a specific induction over the communication classes of the chain. We are able to explicitely characterize the polynomial convergence parameter, to determine the complete set of quasistationary distributions and to provide explicit estimates for the speed of convergence to quasi-limiting distributions in the case of finitely many communication classes. We conclude with an application of these results to the case of denumerable state spaces, where we are able to prove that, in general, there is existence of a quasi-stationary distribution without assuming irreducibility before absorption. This actually holds true assuming only aperiodicity, the existence of a Lyapunov function and the existence of a point in the state space from which the return time is finite with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Long-range first-passage percolation on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a geometric version of first-passage percolation on the complete graph, known as long-range first-passage percolation. Here, the vertices of the complete graph $\mathcal K_n$ are embedded in the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb T_n^d$, and each edge $e$ is assigned an independent transmission time $T_e=\|e\|_{\mathbb T_n^d}^\alpha E_e$, where $E_e$ is a rate-one exponential random variable associated with the edge $e$, $\|\cdot\|_{\mathbb T_n^d}$ denotes the torus-norm, and $\alpha\geq0$ is a parameter. We are interested in the case $\alpha\in[0,d)$, which corresponds to the instantaneous percolation regime for long-range first-passage percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$ studied by Chatterjee and Dey, and which extends first-passage percolation on the complete graph (the $\alpha=0$ case) studied by Janson. We consider the typical distance, flooding time, and diameter of the model. Our results show a $1,2,3$-type result, akin to first-passage percolation on the complete graph as shown by Janson. The results also provide a quantitative perspective to the qualitative results observed by Chatterjee and Dey on $\mathbb Z^d$.</description>

      <title>Empirical martingale projections via the adapted Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a collection of multidimensional pairs $\{(X_i,Y_i):1 \leq i\leq n\}$, we study the problem of projecting the associated suitably smoothed empirical measure onto the space of martingale couplings (i.e. distributions satisfying $\mathbb{E}[Y|X]=X$) using the adapted Wasserstein distance. We call the resulting distance the smoothed empirical martingale projection distance (SE-MPD), for which we obtain an explicit characterization. We also show that the space of martingale couplings remains invariant under the smoothing operation. We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d. or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated. Using these results, we introduce a novel consistent martingale coupling hypothesis test, which we apply to test the existence of arbitrage opportunities in recently introduced neural network-based generative models for asset pricing calibration.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic fluctuations of linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices with i.i.d. entries. We prove that for a complex analytic test function, the centered and normalized linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices converge to a normal distribution. We find the exact expression of the variance of the limiting normal distribution via combinatorial arguments. Moreover, we also argue that the limiting spectral distribution of properly scaled centrosymmetric matrices follows the circular law.</description>

      <title>Long-range competition on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study competition between two growth models with long-range correlations on the torus $\mathbb T_n^d$ of size $n$ in dimension $d$. We append the edge set of the torus $\mathbb T_n^d$ by including all non-nearest-neighbour edges, and from two source vertices $v^\ominus$ and $v^\oplus$ in $\mathbb T_n^d$ two infection processes $\ominus$ and $\oplus$ start spreading to other vertices. Each susceptible vertex can be infected by at most one infection type and when infected stays infected forever (i.e.\ competing SI models). A vertex $v$ infected with type $\square\in\{\ominus,\oplus\}$ infects a susceptible vertex $u$ at rate $\lambda_\square \|u-v\|^{-\alpha_\square}$, where $\lambda_{\ominus}=\lambda_\ominus(n),\lambda_\oplus=\lambda_\oplus(n)&gt;0$ and $\alpha_\ominus=\alpha_\ominus(n),\alpha_\oplus=\alpha_\oplus(n)\in[0,d)$ are allowed to depend on $n$. We study coexistence, the event that both infections reach an asymptotically positive proportion of the graph as $n$ tends to infinity, and identify precisely when coexistence occurs. In the case of absence of coexistence, we outline several phase transitions in the size of the infection that reaches a negligible proportion of the vertices, which depends on the ratio of the sum of infection rates across all vertices of type $\ominus$ and $\oplus$. The work extends known results for the case $\alpha_\ominus(n)=\alpha_\oplus(n)\equiv 0$ and $\lambda_\ominus(n)\equiv 1, \lambda_\oplus(n)\equiv \lambda&gt;0$, and includes general and novel results that cannot be observed when the model parameters are fixed and independent of $n$. The main technical contribution is a coupling of the competition process with branching random walks, where we are able to use the coupling even when coupling error between the competition process and the branching random walks is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the coupled processes.</description>

      <title>Which exceptional low-dimensional projections of a Gaussian point cloud can be found in polynomial time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed as models for random dendritic growth in two dimensions, and as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra in problems in classical function theory. These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <title>Empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in populations with density-dependent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a density-dependent Markov jump process describing a population where each individual is characterized by a type, and reproduces at rates depending both on its type and on the population type distribution. We are interested in the empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in the population process. First, we exhibit a time-inhomogeneous Markov process, which allows to capture the behavior of a sampled lineage in the population process. This is achieved through a many-to-one formula, which relates the expected value of a functional evaluated over the lineages in the population process to the expectation of the functional evaluated along this time-inhomogeneous process. This provides a direct interpretation of the underlying survivorship bias, as illustrated on a minimalistic population process. Second, we consider the large population regime, when the population size grows to infinity. Under classical assumptions, the population type distribution converges to a deterministic limit. Here, we focus on the empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in this large population limit, for which we establish a many-to-one formula. Using coupling arguments, we further quantify the approximation error which arises when sampling in this large population approximation instead of the finite-size population process.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping for multidimensional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the optimal stopping of multidimensional Brownian motion in a bounded domain. Under a geometric condition, we provide a simple proof that the value function is the pointwise infimum of Dirichlet Laplacian potentials dominating the gain function. Weakening this condition, approximations from differential geometry and potential theory provide a similar result when the infimum is taken over a branching set of piecewise potentials.</description>

Abstract: We consider a diffusion in a Gaussian random environment that is white in time and study the large-scale behavior of the quenched density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We show that under diffusive rescaling, the fluctuations of the density converge to a Gaussian limit, described by an additive stochastic heat equation. In the case where the environment is divergence-free, our result can be interpreted as computing the scaling limit of the first-order correction to the quenched Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Approximate Modeling for Supercritical Galton-Watson Branching Processes with Compound Poisson-Gamma Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study asymptotic properties of supercritical Galton-Watson (GW) branching processes in the asymptotic where the mean of the offspring distribution approaches 1 from above. We show that the population-size distribution of the GW branching processes at a sufficiently large generation in this asymptotic can be approximated by a compound Poisson-gamma distribution. Numerical experiments revealed that the compound Poisson-gamma models were in good agreement with the corresponding GW models for sufficiently large generations under a reasonable parameter regime. Our results can be regarded as supporting the use of the compound Poisson-gamma model as a model for cascaded multiplication processes, such as detection signals of electron multipliers and population sizes of individuals with specific biological characteristics.</description>

      <title>A few notes on the asymptotic behavior of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the optimum solution for vector inputs coincides with the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the gain due to power allocation over time is two. It is also established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian random code-books, achieves the optimum boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study isometries of $p$-Wasserstein spaces. In our first result, for every complete and separable metric space $X$ and for every $p\geq1$, we construct a metric space $Y$ such that $X$ embeds isometrically into $Y$, and the $p$-Wasserstein space over $Y$ admits mass-splitting isometries. Our second result is about embeddings into rigid constructions. We show that any complete and separable metric space $X$ can be embedded isometrically into a metric space $Y$ such that the $1$-Wasserstein space is isometrically rigid.</description>
