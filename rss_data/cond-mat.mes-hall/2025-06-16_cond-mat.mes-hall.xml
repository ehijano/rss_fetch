      <title>Tunable Photodetectors Based on 2D Hybrid Structures from Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Photochromic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in two-dimensional (2D) hybrid structures that integrate transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with photochromic molecules for photodetector applications. Atomically thin TMD semiconductors offer strong light-matter interaction, tunable bandgaps, and efficient carrier transport, making them suitable for photodetectors. Photochromic molecules, capable of reversible structural changes in response to external light, can modulate their chemical, optical, and electronic properties. The combinations of various light-adaptive compounds and TMDs provide a versatile platform to explore optically programmable behaviors such as wavelength-selective photoresponse, nonvolatile switching, and multilevel memory characteristics. TMD/photochromic hybrids offer new functional capabilities that are difficult to achieve with either component alone. This mini-review summarizes material properties, interfacial integration strategies, working mechanisms, and representative device demonstrations. We conclude by highlighting future research directions toward the practical implementation of photoresponsive hybrid systems in high-performance adaptive optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Antichiral edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in a two-dimensional proximity-induced superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Magnon-magnon interaction induced by nonlinear spin wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave dynamics can induce an effective resonant interaction between non-resonant magnon modes in a yttrium iron garnet disk. Under strong pumping near the ferromagnetic resonance mode, we observe a spectral splitting that emerges with increasing drive amplitude. This phenomenon is well captured by a theoretical framework based on the linearization of a magnon three-wave mixing Hamiltonian, which at high power leads to parametric Suhl instabilities. The access and control of nonlinear magnon-parametric processes enables the development of experimental platforms in an unexplored parameter regime for both classical and quantum computation protocols.</description>

      <title>Magnon-plasmon hybridization mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two-dimensional crystals: tuning with electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, based on spin-orbit interaction associated with mobile (conduction) electrons has been proposed. Here, we consider another mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization, which is based on spin-orbit coupling attributed to localized spins and leading to the antisymmetric exchange (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction. The basic element of the mechanism of magnon-plasmon coupling relies on the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction by the electric field associated with plasmons. We show, that the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya components due to electric field accompanied by plasmons may lead to hybridization of magnons and plasmons. Moreover, we also show that an external electric field normal to the layer (due to a gate voltage, for instance) can be used as a tool to tune the strength of the magnon-plasmon coupling.</description>

      <title>Current-Controlled Magnon-Magnon Coupling in an On-Chip Cavity Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing spin currents to control magnon dynamics enables new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we demonstrate current-controlled magnon-magnon coupling between cavity and boundary modes in an ultrathin film of Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). Cavity modes emerge in a BiYIG region between two Pt nanostripes, where interfacial anisotropy modifies the magnon dispersion. These modes hybridize with boundary magnons confined within the Pt-capped BiYIG, resulting in an anticrossing gap. Modeling based on dipole-exchange spin-wave dispersion accurately reproduces the observed modes and their hybridization. Spin current injection via the spin Hall effect in a Pt nanostripe disrupts the cavity boundary conditions and suppresses both cavity modes and hybridization upon driving the system beyond the damping compensation threshold. Furthermore, tuning the microwave power applied to a microstrip antenna enables controlled detuning of the anticrossing gap. Our findings provide a platform for exploring spin current-magnon interactions and designing on-chip reconfigurable magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Characteristic Equations: A Unified Non-Bloch Band Theory via Wavefunction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics, where determining the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions is a fundamental problem. Non-Bloch band theory, based on the characteristic equation $\text{det}[E - H(\beta)] = 0$, has emerged as a key tool for this task. However, we show that this framework becomes insufficient in systems with certain symmetries, where identical characteristic equations can yield different spectra. To resolve this, we develop a unified theory that incorporates additional wavefunction information beyond the characteristic equation. Our framework accurately captures spectral properties such as the energy spectrum and the end-to-end signal response in a broad class of systems, particularly those with high symmetry. It reveals the essential role of wavefunction information and symmetry in shaping non-Hermitian band theory.</description>

      <title>Orbital Pumping in Ferrimagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of pure orbital currents generated by both coherent and thermal magnons in the magnetic insulator Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). The pumping of orbital and spin currents is jointly investigated in nano-devices made of naturally oxidized Cu, pure Cu, Pt, and Cr. The absence of charge conduction in BiYIG and the negligible spin-to-charge conversion of oxidized Cu allows us to disambiguate the orbital current contribution. Comparative measurements on YIG and BiYIG show that the origin of the orbital pumping in BiYIG/oxidized Cu is the dynamics of the orbital magnetization in the magnetic insulator. In Cr, the pumping signal is dominated by the negative spin Hall effect rather than the positive orbital Hall effect, indicating that orbital currents represent a minority of the total angular momentum current pumped from the magnetic insulator. Our results also evidence that improving the interfacial transparency significantly enhances pumping efficiencies not only for spin, but also for orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Synaptic plasticity in Co/Nb:STO memristive devices: The role of oxygen vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to develop energy-efficient devices that mimic biological synapses. One promising approach involves memristive devices that can dynamically adjust their electrical resistance in response to stimuli, similar to synaptic weight changes in the brain. However, a key challenge is understanding and controlling the coexistence of different types of synaptic plasticity, such as short-term and long-term plasticity. In this work, we show that plasticity behaviors in Co/Nb:STO Schottky memristors originate from oxygen vacancy electromigration, which modulates the Schottky barrier and enables both short-term and long-term plasticity. Our experiments reveal that resistance changes follow a power-law during reading (short-term plasticity) and increase stepwise with successive pulses (long-term memory retention). These behaviors are successfully reproduced by our model, which demonstrates the correlation between oxygen vacancy distribution and Schottky barrier modulation. Our findings highlight these memristors as promising candidates for neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (&lt; 0.35 nm/$\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ &lt; 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards 4D modelisation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical picture of thermal field-emission (TFE) from semiconductors has been limited to 1D and 2D models. This can be attributed to the complex and interdependent phenomena that is involved in TFE from semiconductors which makes the calculations cumbersome. Such limitations result in a partial understanding of the underlying physics of semiconducting surfaces under high electrical fields, which requires the addition of the temporal dimension (4D) to yield a realistic model. Here we develop a 3D model of TFE from semiconductors that can take arbitrary geometries and doping levels. Our model successfully reproduces the characteristic saturation plateau of some semiconductors, as well as its dependence in temperature. The model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data from ntype Germanium at a qualitative level. We propose this model as a platform for future extensions into the full 4D framework, incorporating temporal dynamics for a more complete and predictive description of thermal-field emission from semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Braiding in a Chiral Mach-Zehnder Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum statistics are the defining characteristic of anyons. Measuring the phase generated by an exchange of anyons is challenging, as standard interferometry setups -- such as the Fabry-P\'erot interferometer -- suffer from charging effects that obscure the interference signal. Here, we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in an optical-like Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on co-propagating interface modes. By avoiding backscattering and deleterious charging effects, this setup enables pristine and robust Aharonov-Bohm interference without any phase slips. At various fractional filling factors, the observed flux periodicities agree with the fundamental fractionally charged excitations that correspond to Jain states and depend only on the bulk topological order. To probe anyonic statistics, we use a small, charged top-gate in the interferometer bulk to induce localized quasiparticles without modifying the Aharonov-Bohm phase; however, with introducing periodic phase slips. The magnitude of the observed phase slips and their signs align with the expected value at filling 1/3, but their direction shows systematic deviations at fillings 2/5 and 3/7. Control over added individual quasiparticles in this design is essential for measuring the coveted non-Abelian statistics in the future.</description>

Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference of fractional quasiparticles in the quantum Hall Effect generally reveals their elementary charge ($e^*$)[1-15]. Recently, our interferometry experiments with several particle states reported flux periods of ${\Delta}{\Phi}=(e/e^*){\Phi}_0$ the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures[16]. Here, we report interference measurements of particle-hole conjugated states at filling factor ${\nu}=2/3, 3/5, 4/7$, revealing unexpected flux periodicities of ${\Delta}{\Phi}={\Phi}_0/{\nu}$. The measured shot noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the interferometers quantum point contacts (QPCs), was found to be, $F={\nu}$[17], and not that of the elementary charge, $F=e^*/e$[18,19]. These observations point to interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles as coherent pairs, triples, and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate, TG), deposited in the center of the interferometer bulk, forming an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the (anti)dots perimeter. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the bunched quasiparticles and thus recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary quasiparticles charge. However, the shot noise Fano factor (of each QPC) consistently remained at $F={\nu}$, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanied the conjugated states. The two observations - bunching and debunching (or dissociation) - are not expected by current theories. Similar effects may likely arise in Jains particle states (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator FQH states[20]</description>

      <title>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Brightening dark excitons and trions in systems with a Mexican-hat energy dispersion: example of InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of momentum-dark excitons and trions formed in two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit an inverted Mexican-hat-shaped dispersion relation, taking monolayer InSe as an example. We employ variational techniques to obtain the momentum-dark and bright ground-states (non-zero and zero quasiparticle momenta, respectively). These states are of particular interest due to their peaks in the quasiparticle density of states, the largest contribution comes from the momentum-dark ground state due to the presence of a van Hove singularity (VHS). These momentum-dark systems require a physical process to provide the necessary momentum to become bright. We study the brightening of this state due to coupling with phonons and compute the resulting photoluminescence spectrum. This work opens new avenues of research, such as exploiting dark excitons in solar cells and other semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule phosphorescence and intersystem crossing in a coupled exciton-plasmon system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning the sharp metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) over a molecule allows tuning the coupling between the tip plasmon and a molecular fluorescence emitter. This allows access to local variations of fluorescence field enhancement and wavelength shifts, which are central parameters for characterizing the plasmon-exciton coupling. Performing the same for phosphorescence with molecular scale resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the investigation of phosphorescence from isolated Pt-Phthalocyanine molecules by analyzing tip-enhanced emission spectra in both current-induced and laser-induced phosphorescence. The latter directly monitors singlet-to-triplet state intersystem crossing of a molecule below the tip. The study contributes to a detailed understanding of triplet excitation pathways and their potential control at sub-molecular length scales. Additionally, the coupling of organic phosphors to plasmonic structures is a promising route for improving light-emitting diodes.</description>

      <title>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton-polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Poor Man's Majoranon in Two Quantum Dots Dressed by Superconducting Quasi-Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a hybrid system consisting of two quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a superconductor (SC), zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance spectrum have been reported as potential signatures of Majorana fermions (MFs). However, such signatures typically appear only at specific parameter values of the QDs--so-called `sweet spots'--and are referred to as the Poor Man's Majorana (PMM). To investigate whether these signatures can be conclusively attributed to genuine MFs emerging over a continuous parameter range, we present an alternative approach that microscopically incorporates the superconducting effects into the QDs, rather than simply attribute them into two phenomenological parameters of QDs. This forms the dressed Majorana fermions (DMFs), which can be viewed as superpositions of quasi-excitations from both the QDs and the SC. We show that DMFs can localize at one end of a one-dimensional SC and persist across a continuous parameter range, thereby enhancing the feasibility of experimental detection. Our results provide a more accurate description of the PMM in such hybrid systems and offer practical guidance for observing end-localized PMM modes in continuous one-dimensional SC.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T &gt; 23 K) and low (T &lt; 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi Liquids from Subsystem Symmetry Breaking in van der Waals Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic switching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.</description>

      <title>A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation</title>

Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.</description>
