      <title>Polyhedral Collision Detection via Vertex Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision detection is a critical functionality for robotics. The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of reliability and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Surface Parametrization with HAND and LEG: Hausdorff Approximation from Node-wise Distances and Localized Energy for Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface parametrization plays a crucial role in various fields, such as computer graphics and medical imaging, and computational science and engineering. However, most existing techniques rely on the discretization of the surface into a triangular mesh. This paper addresses the problem of point cloud surface parametrization and presents two novel loss functions and a framework for point cloud surface parametrization based on deep neural networks. The first loss function aims to provide a soft constraint on parameter domain, allowing the handling of parameter domains with complex shapes or geometries. This loss function can also be used in generalizing landmark matching. The second loss function focuses on minimizing local distortion on the point cloud surface, demonstrating effectiveness in preserving the surface's local shape characteristics. We parametrized the functions involved using neural networks, and developed an algorithm for the minimization. Numerical experiments for shape matching, free-boundary and fixed-boundary surface parametrization and landmark matching, along with applications including surface reconstruction and boundary detection, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The algorithmic Fried Potato Problem in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conway's Fried Potato Problem seeks to determine the best way to cut a convex body in $n$ parts by $n-1$ hyperplane cuts (with the restriction that the $i$-th cut only divides in two one of the parts obtained so far), in a way as to minimize the maxuimum of the inradii of the parts. It was shown by Bezdek and Bezdek that the solution is always attained by $n-1$ parallel cuts. But the algorithmic problem of finding the best direction for these parallel cuts remains.
  In this note we show that for a convex $m$-gon $P$, this direction (and hence the cuts themselves) can be found in time $O(m \log^4 m)$, which improves on a quadratic algorithm proposed by Ca\~nete-Fern\'andez-M\'arquez (DMD 2022). Our algorithm first preprocesses what we call the dome (closely related to the medial axis) of $P$ using a variant of the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy, so that linear programs in the dome and in slices of it can be solved in polylogarithmic time.</description>

      <title>Indirect predicates for geometric constructions</title>

Abstract: Geometric predicates are a basic ingredient to implement a vast range of algorithms in computational geometry. Modern implementations employ floating point filtering techniques to combine efficiency and robustness, and state-of-the-art predicates are guaranteed to be always exact while being only slightly slower than corresponding (inexact) floating point implementations. Unfortunately, if the input to these predicates is an intermediate construction of an algorithm, its floating point representation may be affected by an approximation error, and correctness is no longer guaranteed. This paper introduces the concept of indirect geometric predicate: instead of taking the intermediate construction as an explicit input, an indirect predicate considers the primitive geometric elements which are combined to produce such a construction. This makes it possible to keep track of the floating point approximation, and thus to exploit efficient filters and expansion arithmetic to exactly resolve the predicate with minimal overhead with respect to a naive floating point implementation. As a representative example, we show how to extend standard predicates to the case of points of intersection of linear elements (i.e. lines and planes) and show that, on classical problems, this approach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions based on lazy exact intermediate representations.</description>

      <title>ZigzagNetVis: Suggesting temporal resolutions for graph visualization using zigzag persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent complex systems and track the evolution of their constituents over time. Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Regularity for Relatively Perfect Discrete Morse Gradient Vector Fields of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One common function class in machine learning is the class of ReLU neural networks. ReLU neural networks induce a piecewise linear decomposition of their input space called the canonical polyhedral complex. It has previously been established that it is decidable whether a ReLU neural network is piecewise linear Morse. In order to expand computational tools for analyzing the topological properties of ReLU neural networks, and to harness the strengths of discrete Morse theory, we introduce a schematic for translating between a given piecewise linear Morse function (e.g. parameters of a ReLU neural network) on a canonical polyhedral complex and a compatible (``relatively perfect") discrete Morse function on the same complex. Our approach is constructive, producing an algorithm that can be used to determine if a given vertex in a canonical polyhedral complex corresponds to a piecewise linear Morse critical point. Furthermore we provide an algorithm for constructing a consistent discrete Morse pairing on cells in the canonical polyhedral complex which contain this vertex. We additionally provide some new realizability results with respect to sublevel set topology in the case of shallow ReLU neural networks.</description>
