      <title>Arc Spline Approximation of Envelopes of Evolving Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the envelope of deforming planar domains is a significant and challenging problem with a wide range of potential applications. We approximate the envelope using circular arc splines, curves that balance geometric flexibility and computational simplicity. Our approach combines two concepts to achieve these benefits.
  First, we represent a planar domain by its medial axis transform (MAT), which is a geometric graph in Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{2,1}$ (possibly with degenerate branches). We observe that circular arcs in the Minkowski space correspond to MATs of arc spline domains. Furthermore, as a planar domain evolves over time, each branch of its MAT evolves and forms a surface in the Minkowski space. This allows us to reformulate the problem of envelope computation as a problem of computing cyclographic images of finite sets of curves on these surfaces. We propose and compare two pairs of methods for approximating the curves and boundaries of their cyclographic images. All of these methods result in an arc spline approximation of the envelope of the evolving domain.
  Second, we exploit the geometric flexibility of circular arcs in both the plane and Minkowski space to achieve a high approximation rate. The computational simplicity ensures the efficient trimming of redundant branches of the generated envelope using a sweep line algorithm with optimal computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs as Metro Maps: Drawing Paths with Few Bends in Trees, Cacti, and Plane 4-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph consists of a set of vertices and a set of subsets of vertices, called hyperedges. In the metro map metaphor, each hyperedge is represented by a path (the metro line) and the union of all these paths is the support graph (metro network) of the hypergraph. Formally speaking, a path-based support is a graph together with a set of paths. We consider the problem of constructing drawings of path-based supports that (i) minimize the sum of the number of bends on all paths, (ii) minimize the maximum number of bends on any path, or (iii) maximize the number of 0-bend paths, then the number of 1-bend paths, etc. We concentrate on straight-line drawings of path-based tree and cactus supports as well as orthogonal drawings of path-based plane supports with maximum degree 4.</description>

      <title>Edge-Constrained Hamiltonian Paths on a Point Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22526v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let S be a set of distinct points in general position in the Euclidean plane. A plane Hamiltonian path on S is a crossing-free geometric path such that every point of S is a vertex of the path. It is known that, if S is sufficiently large, there exist three edge-disjoint plane Hamiltonian paths on S. In this paper we study an edge-constrained version of the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths on a point set. We first consider the problem of finding a single plane Hamiltonian path pi with endpoints s, t in S and constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) ab in pi; (ii) ab not in pi. We characterize those quintuples (S, a, b, s, t) for which pi exists. Secondly, we consider the problem of finding two plane Hamiltonian paths pi_1, pi_2 on a set S with constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and ab is an edge of pi_1; (ii) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and none of them includes ab as an edge; (iii) both pi_1 and pi_2 include ab as an edge and share no other edges. In all cases, we characterize those triples (S, a, b) for which pi_1 and pi_2 exist.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Unit Disk Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned one of c colors, where V(G) can be written as a union of a total of c subsets V_{1},...,V_{c} and V_{i} denotes the set of vertices of color i. A subset S of V(G) is called a selective subset if, for every i, every vertex v in V_{i} has at least one nearest neighbor in $S \cup (V(G) \setminus V_{i})$ that also lies in V_{i}. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem asks for a selective subset of minimum size.
  We show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs, even when c=2. As a consequence, the problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless P = NP. On the positive side, we present a PTAS for unit disk graphs, which works without requiring a geometric representation and applies for arbitrary c. We further prove that MSS remains NP-complete in unit disk graphs for arbitrary c. In addition, we show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on circle graphs, even when c=2.</description>

      <title>Helly theorem for affine spaces without dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-dimensional Helly theorem for affine spaces and convex sets using the unboundedness framework of Aronov, Goodman, and Pollack (Computational Geometry, 2002). This generalizes the fundamental result of Adiprasito, B\'ar\'any, Mustafa, and Terpai on the no-dimensional Helly theorem for points and convex sets (Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry, 2020). Additionally, we establish the optimality of our result.</description>

      <title>On a Geometry of Interbrain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.</description>
