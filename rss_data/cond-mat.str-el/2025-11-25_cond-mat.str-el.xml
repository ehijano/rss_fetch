      <title>Functional renormalization with interaction flows: A single-boson exchange perspective and application to electron-phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.</description>

      <title>Many-body electronic structure in pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyrochlore lattice materials can exhibit geometrical frustration, while the related many-body electronic states remain elusive. In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2{\Delta}/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Power-Law correlated Disorder and Long-Range Hopping in One Dimension: Mobility Edges, Criticality, and ML-Based Phase Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding model in which onsite
  potentials $\{\varepsilon_i\}$ exhibit power-law spatial correlations
  (with exponent $\alpha$) and the hopping amplitudes decay as
  $t_{ij}\sim |i-j|^{-\beta}$. This two-parameter family interpolates
  continuously between short-range Anderson-like disorder, correlated
  disorder with conventional hopping, and long-range hopping models with
  nontrivial delocalization tendencies. Using large-scale exact
  diagonalization, we construct a comprehensive phase map in the
  $(\alpha,\beta)$ plane by combining spectral statistics, density-of-states
  analysis, and energy-resolved localization indicators such as the
  participation ratio, single-particle entanglement entropy, level-spacing
  ratio $r$, and the ratio of the geometric to arithmetic density of
  states. From these observables we define phase-indicator functions that
  compactly quantify localization behaviour across the spectrum. Our analysis reveals robust mobility edges and multiple regimes of
  spectral coexistence between localized, extended, resonant, and critical
  states. Finite-size scaling, implemented via an explicit smoothness-based
  cost function, enables extraction of critical exponents and delineation
  of transition lines across the $(\alpha,\beta)$ parameter space.
  To validate and complement these physics-based diagnostics, we employ a
  supervised autoencoder that learns high-level representations of
  eigenstate structure directly from raw features and reliably reproduces
  the phase classification defined by the indicator functions. Together,
  these approaches provide a coherent and internally consistent picture of
  the spectral transitions driven by correlated disorder and long-range
  hopping, establishing a unified framework for characterizing mobility
  edges in long-range one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A non-equilibrium quantum transport framework for spintronic devices with dynamical correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-terminal spintronic devices remain challenging to model under realistic operating conditions, where the interplay of complex electronic structures, correlation effects and bias-driven non-equilibrium dynamics may significantly impact charge and spin transport. Existing {\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18526v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-layered perovskite Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, characterized by a 4$d^4$ electron configuration, has been studied from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation, with inclusion of strong on-site Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SO+$U$), in the framework of the fully relativistic, spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) band-structure method. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials.</description>

      <title>Competition between charge-density-wave and superconducting orders on eight-leg square Hubbard cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of whether $d$-wave superconductivity (SC) occurs in the square-lattice Hubbard model with $U$ of order of the bandwidth has been one of the most debated issues to emerge from the study of high temperature SC. Here, we report variational results on eight-leg cylinders with next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the range $-0.5 t \leq t'\leq 0.25 t$ with $U = 8t$ and $12t$ and doped hole concentrations $\delta=1/12$ and $1/8$. For $t'\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'&gt;0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Web of Non-invertible Dualities for (2+1) Dimensional Models with Subsystem Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Enhanced Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Study of LaTe$_3$: Absence of a Photoinduced Secondary CDW in the Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical control offers a compelling route for tailoring material properties on an ultrafast time scale. Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour.</description>

      <title>Bound states for systems with quartic energy-momentum dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states and its energies for systems with the quartic energy-momentum dispersion $E(p) \sim p^4$ and polynomial potentials are studied using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) semiclassical approximation and the Wentzel complex method taking into account higher order WKB corrections. The obtained energies are compared with numerical values found by applying the variational approach utilizing the universal Gaussian basis. It is found that the wave functions of the ground and higher-energy states for systems with quartic dispersion have nodes in the classically forbidden region. Thus, the well-known oscillation theorem for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is not, in general, applicable for systems with quartic dispersion. Still it is observed that the oscillation theorem holds in the classically allowed region in all considered examples. The properties of bound state wave functions are compared with the solutions of the exactly solvable problem of a square well potential.</description>

      <title>Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Diagnosis of mixed-state topological phases in strongly correlated systems via disorder parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing topological phases for strongly interacting fermions in the mixed-state regime remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles.</description>

      <title>Kondo screening and random-singlet formation in highly disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model to capture the anomalous low-temperature thermodynamics of doped semiconductors, such as Si:P, across the metal-insulator transition. We consider pairs of local magnetic moments coupled to a highly disordered, non-interacting electronic bath that undergoes a metal-insulator transition with increasing doping. Using a large-$\mathcal{N}$ variational approach, we capture both the inhomogeneous local Fermi-liquid and the insulating random-singlet phase, and find that the local moment susceptibility exhibits a robust power-law behavior, $\chi(T) \propto T^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ evolving smoothly with doping before saturating in the metal. Our results highlight the competition between Kondo screening and random-singlet formation as the key ingredient in constructing a complete theory for the low-temperature behavior of strongly disordered interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid instability of the Kitaev honeycomb model with crystallographic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb gapless spin liquid in the presence of Stone-Wales-type local lattice defects with odd-sided plaquettes. While the clean Kitaev model has no finite-temperature phase transitions, we find that introducing a finite defect density $n_d\approx 10^{-4}$--$10^{-2}$ produces a true phase transition with a sizeable $T_c \approx 2 n_d$ in units of the Kitaev exchange. The resulting non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid exhibits scalar spin chirality and electron orbital magnetization which peak near lattice defects. This disorder-driven instability relies on an emergent long range ferromagnetic interaction $r^{-\gamma}$ ($\gamma \approx 2.7$) between defect chiralities, mediated by the nearly-gapless fermions, with implications for topology generation in Dirac cones with fluctuating mass terms.</description>

      <title>Exploring fixed points and eigenstates of quantum systems with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.</description>

      <title>Probing Antiferromagnetic Hysteresis on Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Brute-force positivization of $J_1-J_2$ model ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring sign structures of quantum wave functions attracts considerable attention due to the potential for advances in modeling complex phases of matter. This stimulates developing different optimization procedures for imitating and manipulating sign structures of quantum states. In this work, utilizing a brute force approach based on a set of single-qubit transformations we evaluate protocols enabling positivization of the one-dimensional $J_1 -J_2$ model ground states in the regime of strong frustration. Based on the obtained positivization results, we show the difference between the cases of periodic and open boundary conditions, and also establish the dependence of the sign structure on parity of the simulated spin chains.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Electronic Structures of V$X_3$ ($X$ = Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal halides V$X_3$ ($X$ = Br and I) have emerged as promising candidates for two dimensional spintronic and quantum applications due to their layer-dependent magnetism and tunable electronic states. However, experimental insights into their ground state electronic structures remain limited. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of V$X_3$ using high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) combined with ligand field multiplet calculations. The RIXS spectra reveal distinct $dd$ and charge-transfer excitations, allowing precise determination of electronic structure parameters, including the crystal field splitting, trigonal distortion, and Racah parameters. The determined parameters showed clear variation, indicating an increase in covalency from Br to I. The trigonal distortion parameters $\Delta_{D_{3d}}$ were determined to be -0.096 eV in VBr$_3$ and 0.07 eV in VI$_3$, indicating a sign opposition between the two compounds, reflecting good agreement with experimental RIXS data. Cluster model calculations yield a high-spin V$^{3+}$ $(S = 1)$ configuration, with an $e'^2_g$ ground state in VBr$_3$ and an $e'^1_ga^1_{1g}$ ground state in VI$_3$, consistent with trigonal elongation and compression, respectively. Our findings provide the most complete experimental determination of the low energy electronic structure in V$X_3$, offering valuable insights for designing 2D magnetic and spintronic materials based on vanadium halides.</description>

      <title>Doublon bound states in the continuum through giant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Berry phase in chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the order parameter in the intermediate phase between the superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking transitions of a $p_x+ip_y$ superconductor under strain. The application of in-plane strain reduces the underlying crystal symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the critical temperature between the $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals, resulting in a Dirac cone structure in the thermodynamic phase diagram. When the strain is varied adiabatically along a closed path enclosing the Dirac cone, the order parameter acquires a Berry phase of $\pi$, which originates from a half rotation of the superconducting gap function. This half rotation leaves a topological signature in the superfluid stiffness tensor, making it directly observable through the geometry of vortices and the upper critical field.</description>

      <title>Giant Domain Walls and Intrinsic Heterogeneity in 214 Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay of structural, charge and spin orders in layered cuprates leads to emergent phenomena, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. However, there is growing awareness that both the structure and electronic ordering that underpin them are not fully homogeneous. Here, we employ scanning three-dimensional X-ray diffraction to spatially resolve structural distortions in La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$, a prototypical system that exhibits a strong competition between superconductivity and charge density wave order, across its low-temperature orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition. We uncover two forms of intrinsic microstructural heterogeneity: at 300 K, we reveal remarkably wide tetragonal-like domain wall regions within the nominally orthorhombic crystal structure, and, upon cooling to 100 K, a fine microstructure of orthorhombic-like stripes embedded within the tetragonal matrix emerges. This spatially resolved view directly defines the microstructural architecture of phase coexistence in this system, demonstrating how structural distortions generate intrinsic heterogeneity that shapes the balance between superconductivity and charge density wave order as constrained by the restrictive orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, offering a pathway to control correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Boost of critical current density near quantum critical points in FeSe-Based superconductors with two superconducting domes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors. It was discovered that each dome is accompanied by a distinct nematic quantum critical point (QCP): one associated with a pure nematic QCP, and the other with a nematic QCP entangled with antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe. The mechanisms of vortex pinning and the influence of quantum critical fluctuations have been extensively explored, emphasizing the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations in modulating $J_{\rm{c}}$. Additionally, an increase in $J_{\rm{c}}$ was also noted near FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$, where its origin has been explored and discussed. This finding provides crucial clues about the existence of an ordered phase endpoint beneath the superconducting dome, offering an initial basis for further investigation into the potential presence of a QCP beneath it.</description>

      <title>Depairing critical current density and the vortex-free state in FeSe nanobridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depairing limit and the vortex-free state in a superconductor is crucial for both the study of supercurrent related physics and the application eliminating noise linked to vortex motion. In this work, we report the evidence of depairing limit and the vortex-free state achieved by geometric constraint in FeSe superconductors. A series of narrow bridges with varying widths at the same location of a single crystal were prepared by the \textquotedblleft pickup\textquotedblright method using successive focused ion beam millings. By simply reducing the width of bridge, the magnitude of critical current density ($J_{\rm{c}}$) is enhanced more than one order, evidence the achievement of depairing limit. Moreover, in the bridge with a width smaller than the penetration depth ($\lambda$), $J_{\rm{c}}$ is found to be robust against magnetic field up to 1 kOe. The field-robust $J_{\rm{c}}$ is a strong piece of evidence for vortex-free state, which is created by the enhancement of lower critical fields due to geometric constraint.</description>

      <title>Increase of critical current density in FeSe superconductor by strain effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional $J_c$-enhancement methods like doping and irradiation often introduce extrinsic elements or defects, altering intrinsic properties. Here, we report a significant $J_c$ enhancement in FeSe single crystals through compressive strain applied using a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic substrate with anisotropic thermal contraction during cooling. Under zero field at 2 K, $J_{\text{c}}$ increases by a factor of $\sim$4 from $\sim 2.3 \times 10^{4}$ to $\sim 8.7 \times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$; at 5 T, it achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement, rising from $\sim 1.0 \times 10^{3}$ to $\sim 1.0 \times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Analysis based on the Dew-Hughes model of the $f_{\text{p}}$(h) relationship shows that strain strengthens vortex pinning, and shifts the pinning mechanism from point-like pinning to combined point and surface pinnings. This work offers an effective method to enhance FeSe's current-carrying limitation, deepens understanding of iron-based superconductors' pinning mechanisms, and highlights strain engineering's potential for optimizing superconducting performance.</description>

      <title>Expansion of Momentum Space and Full 2$\pi$ Solid Angle Photoelectron Collection in Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy by Applying Sample Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) directly probes the energy and momentum of electrons in quantum materials, but conventional setups capture only a small fraction of the full 2$\pi$ solid angle. This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$\pi$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of many-qubit systems is an outstanding problem that has recently driven significant advances in both numerical methods and programmable quantum processing units. In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs. In particular, our work connects classical simulability to different regimes associated with quantum dynamics in Rydberg arrays - namely, quasi-adiabatic dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and quantum quenches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for topology- and correlation-driven quantum states, kagome lattice materials have garnered significant interest for their band structures, featuring flat bands (FBs) from the quantum destructive interference of the electronic wavefunction. Tuning an FB to the chemical potential could induce electronic instabilities and emergent orders. Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their role in emergent orders in bulk materials remains lacking. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and density functional theory, we show that the low-energy structure of the Cr-based kagome metal superconductor {\Cr} is dominated by FBs at the Fermi level. We also observe low-energy magnetic excitations evolving across the low-temperature transition, largely consistent with the FB shift. Our results suggest that the low-temperature order contains a magnetic origin and that the kagome FBs may play a role in the emergence of this order.</description>

Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</description>

Abstract: Theintertwining of electron-hole correlation and nontrivial topology is known to give rise to exotic topological
  excitonic insulators. Here, we show that the involvement of quantum geometry can characterize more exotic
  excitonic phases exhibiting physical properties that are not influenced by their topology but by geometry.
  Starting from a topological band insulator and gradually reducing the band gap, many-body interaction can
  initially generate a p + ip-wave and then an s-wave excitonic insulator. Interestingly, they bear the same Chern
  number but exhibit completely different spin textures and magneto-optical Kerr responses, reflecting the intricate
  geometric distinctions in their wave functions. We also propose to enhance the correlation effect via Floquet
  engineering, which provides a systematic way to realize these topological excitonic insulators and their phase
  transitions in the nonequilibrium steady states. Our results demonstrate correlated phenomena characterized by
  quantum geometry, beyond the conventional topological classifications.</description>

      <title>Spin structures and phase diagrams of the spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ under magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</description>

      <title>Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order</title>

Abstract: Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Three Types of Non-Fermi-Liquid Fixed Point for a Triplet Quantum Impurity in a Cubic Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cubic metals, a local, magnetic moment with a triplet ground state coupled to $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons can give rise to various non-Fermi liquid (NFL) quantum critical behaviors. To date, only those exchange couplings have been studied that are spherically symmetric already in the high-temperature, local moment regime. Namely, only the effects of potential scattering, dipolar spin exchange, i.e. Kondo, and quadrupolar exchange couplings were considered, and two types of NFL fixed points have been identified. However, in cubic symmetry, six independent exchange couplings can be present in the Hamiltonian: in addition to the spherically symmetric potential scattering and Kondo exchange, there are four independent, spherical-symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian terms: two quadrupolar-quadrupolar, a dipolar-octupolar and a quadrupolar-octupolar exchange interaction, where the first/second element of the compound adjectives refers to the impurity/conduction-electron transitions. While all of them flow to fixed points where rotational invariance is recovered, I found that one of the quadrupolar-quadrupolar couplings flows to a previously unidentified NFL fixed point. I derive the exchange couplings allowed by cubic symmetry, solve them with the numerical renormalization group, and present three types of NFL excitation spectrum$-$one of which is novel, at least in the context of a quantum impurity with a triplet ground state.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Lowest Landau Level: Unlocking More Robust Fractional States Using Flat Chern Bands with Higher Vortexability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moir\'e flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Universality of the Mott Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.</description>

      <title>Structural phase transitions in the van der Waals ferromagnets Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we provide a detailed study of the crystal structure and physical properties of the recently discovered vdW ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y&gt;2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y&lt;2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y &gt; 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\,K. All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K. Both the critical temperature for the structural transition and the Curie temperature are moderately suppressed with increasing Pd fraction $y$ and corresponding decreasing Fe fraction $x$, indicating that synthetic control over $x$ and $y$ paves way for the further exploration of these compounds.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Hall effect, a voltage drop develops perpendicularly to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Recent developments with quantum simulators have unveiled strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in a non-electronic system of strongly interacting fermions was not achieved to date. Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a cold-atom analogue of a solid-state Hall bar and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analogue quantum simulations and measurements performed in solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding tighter bounds compared to those obtained without coarse-graining.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. We argue that different superconducting states in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni $3d$ and O $2p$ states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ within the random phase approximation and find a transition between $d$-wave and sign-changing $s$-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic principle of emergent 1-form symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$, and the gap is found to fill instead of close with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Nesting-driven ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model. Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases, such as half-metallicity and cone magnetic structure, are studied.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of Berry phase estimation in topological phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berry phase is a fundamental quantity in the classification of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have $\textit{a priori}$ bound for ground state energy. Here, $\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption. These results advance the role of quantum computing in the study of topological phases of matter and provide a pathway for clarifying the connection between topological phases of matter and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Dual holography as functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</description>

      <title>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal flat bands with Chern number $C$ are commonly understood as color-entangled states constructed from $C$ copies of the lowest Landau level. In realistic moir\'e systems, however, the band geometry is generally non-ideal, and the mechanism that stabilizes such FCIs remains unclear. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene as a platform, we find two FCIs separated by a continuous transition driven by a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions.Below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable, and the resulting fractional phase is naturally described by the Halperin-$(112)$ state. Above the transition, the system is geometrically unstable, entering a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of standard quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this unconventional phenomenon, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: in the geometrically unstable regime, interactions hybridize electronic states near the $K$ point and generate an emergent ideal color component that supports the FCI. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," directly visualizing the ideal subcomponent in the single-particle level. Together, these results establish mechanisms which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, substantially enlarging their viable parameter space and clarifying the role of quantum geometry in strongly correlated topological phases.</description>
