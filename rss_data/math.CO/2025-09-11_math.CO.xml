      <title>The Eigenvalue Method in Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay down the foundations of the Eigenvalue Method in coding theory. The method uses modern algebraic graph theory to derive upper bounds on the size of error-correcting codes for various metrics, addressing major open questions in the field. We identify the core assumptions that allow applying the Eigenvalue Method, test it for multiple well-known classes of error-correcting codes, and compare the results with the best bounds currently available. By applying the Eigenvalue Method, we obtain new bounds on the size of error-correcting codes that often improve the state of the art. Our results show that spectral graph theory techniques capture structural properties of error-correcting codes that are missed by classical coding theory approaches.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the 2004 Albert-Grossman-Nowakowski-Wolfe Conjecture on Alternating Linear Clobber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clobber is an alternate-turn two-player game introduced in 2001 by Albert, Grossman, Nowakowski and Wolfe. The board is a graph with each node colored black (x), white (o), or empty (-). Player Left has black stones, player Right has white stones. On a turn, a player takes one of their stones that is adjacent to an opponent stone and clobbers the opponent's stone (replaces it with theirs). Whoever cannot move loses. Linear clobber is clobber played on a path, for example, one row of a Go board. In 2004 Albert et al. conjectured that, for every even-length alternating-color linear clobber position except oxoxox, the first player has a winning strategy. We prove their conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a graph $G$ admits a quasi-isometry $\phi$ to a graph $H$ of bounded path-width, then we can assign a non-negative integer length to each edge of $H$, such that the same function $\phi$ is a quasi-isometry to this weighted version of $H$, with error only an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. III. Excluding a fat tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour proved that for every finite tree $H$, there exists $k$ such that every finite graph $G$ with no $H$ minor has path-width at most $k$; and conversely, for every integer $k$, there is a finite tree $H$ such that every finite graph $G$ with an $H$ minor has path-width more than $k$. If we (twice) replace ``path-width'' by ``line-width'', the same is true for infinite graphs $G$.
  We prove a ``coarse graph theory'' analogue, as follows. For every finite tree $H$ and every $c$, there exist $k,L,C$ such that every graph that does not contain $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits an $(L,C)$-quasi-isonetry to a graph with line-width at most $k$; and conversely, for all $k,L,C$ there exist $c$ and a finite tree $H$ such that every graph that contains $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits no $(L,C)$-quasi-isometry to a graph with line-width at most $k$.</description>

      <title>Catalan structures arising from pattern-avoiding Stoimenow matchings and other Fishburn objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection with Vassiliev's knot invariants, Stoimenow introduced in 1998 a class of matchings, also known as regular linearized chord diagrams. These matchings are linked to various combinatorial structures, all of which are associated with the Fishburn numbers. In this paper, we address a problem posed by Bevan et~al.\ concerning the identification of subsets of Stoimenow matchings that are counted by the Catalan numbers. We present five solutions in terms of pattern-avoiding matchings. We also consider four infinite families of patterns that generalize four of the five forbidden patterns appearing in the solution to the problem we solved and prove that the matchings avoiding them are equinumerous. Finally, we establish numerous results on distributions and joint equidistribution of statistics over Catalan-counted subsets of Fishburn structures, namely Stoimenow matchings, $(2+2)$-free posets, ascent sequences, and Fishburn permutations, notably expressing some of them in terms of Narayana numbers and others in terms of ballot numbers.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Computing Integer Hulls of 2D Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\texttt{IntegerHull}$ function is part of Maple's $\texttt{PolyhedralSets}$ library, which calculates the integer hull of a given polyhedral set. This algorithm works by translating the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the input polyhedral set inwards till each hyperplane encounters at least one integer point. The polyhedral set is then divided into smaller regions and a brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.
  There are certain edge case scenarios where the computational cost of the existing algorithm can be high, for which we propose a new algorithm. We translate the supporting hyperplanes of the facets inwards from the (relative) opposite vertex till the hyperplanes encounter at least one integer point. Then, we can follow the same procedure as the old algorithm or use a recursive technique on the smaller regions.
  The edge case scenarios mentioned above occurs when there are integer points present on the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the polyhedral set. This increases the region on which the brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Beyond Additive Functions with Applications to Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setting where we have a ground set $M$ together with real-valued set functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$, and the goal is to partition $M$ into two sets $S_1,S_2$ such that $|f_i(S_1) - f_i(S_2)|$ is small for every $i$. Many results in discrepancy theory can be stated in this form with the functions $f_i$ being additive. In this work, we initiate the study of the unstructured case where $f_i$ is not assumed to be additive. We show that even without the additivity assumption, the upper bound remains at most $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
  Our result has implications on the fair allocation of indivisible goods. In particular, we show that a consensus halving up to $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ goods always exists for $n$ agents with monotone utilities. Previously, only an $O(n)$ bound was known for this setting.</description>

      <title>Injective edge-coloring of claw-free graphs with maximum degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An injective $k$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a mapping $\phi$: $E(G)\rightarrow\{1,2,...,k\}$, such that $\phi(e)\ne\phi(e')$ if edges $e$ and $e'$ are at distance two, or are in a triangle. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an injective $k$-edge-coloring is called the injective chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_i'(G)$. A graph is called claw-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph $K_{1,3}$. In this paper, we show that $\chi_i'(G)\le 13$ for every claw-free graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)\leq 4$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

      <title>Special restricted partition functions for the stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf a:=(a_1,\ldots,a_r)$ be a sequence of positive integers, $d\geq 2$ and $j\geq 1$, some integers. We study the functions $p_{\mathbf a,d}(n):=$ the number of integer solutions $(x_1,\dots,x_r)$ of $\sum_{i=1}^r a_ix_i=n$, with $x_i\geq 0$ and $x_i \equiv 0,1(\bmod\;d)$, for all $1\leq i\leq r$, and $p_{\mathbf a,d}(n;j):=$ the number of $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ as above which satisfy also the condition $\sum_{i=1}^r \left(x_i-(d-2)\left\lfloor \frac{x_i}{d} \right\rfloor\right) =j$.
  We give formulas for $p_{\mathbf a,d}(n)$ and its polynomial part $P_{\mathbf a,d}(n)$, and also for $p_{\mathbf a,d}(n;j)$. As an application, we compute the dimensions of the stable cohomology groups for certain line bundles associated to flag varieties, defined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the spectral gap of generalised pancake graphs is strictly less than 2 and strictly less than 1 for burnt pancake graphs. In addition, we establish lower bounds on the multiplicities of certain integer eigenvalues of generalised pancake graphs. Together, these results settle two recent conjectures of Blanco and Buehrle.</description>

      <title>On Legendre Cordial Labeling of Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. For a simple connected graph $G$ of order $n$, a bijective function $f:V(G)\to\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is said to be a Legendre cordial labeling modulo $p$ if the induced function $f_p^*:E(G)\to \{0,1\}$, defined by $f_p^* (uv)=0$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=-1$ or $f(u)+f(v)\equiv 0(\text{mod } p)$ and $f_p^* (uv)=1$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=1$, satisfies the condition $|e_{f_p^*}(0)-e_{f_p^*}(1)|\leq 1$ where $e_{f_p^*}(i)$ is the number of edges with label $i$ ($i=0,1$). This paper explores the characterization of the Legendre cordial labeling modulo $p$ of the complete graph $K_n$ using the concept of Legendre graph.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order Ten with Two Relations: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-net($n$) is a combinatorial design equivalent to $k-2$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. A relation in a net is a linear dependency over $\mathbb{F}_2$ in the incidence matrix of the net. A computational enumeration of all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order 10 whose corresponding nets have at least two nontrivial relations was achieved by Delisle in 2010 and verified by an independent search of Myrvold. In this paper, we confirm the correctness of their exhaustive enumerations with a satisfiability (SAT) solver approach instead of using custom-written backtracking code. Performing the enumeration using a SAT solver has at least three advantages. First, it reduces the amount of trust necessary, as SAT solvers produce independently-verifiable certificates that their enumerations are complete. These certificates can be checked by formal proof verifiers that are relatively simple pieces of software, and therefore easier to trust. Second, it is typically more straightforward and less error-prone to use a SAT solver over writing search code. Third, it can be more efficient to use a SAT-based approach, as SAT solvers are highly optimized pieces of software incorporating backtracking-with-learning for improving the efficiency of the backtracking search. For example, the SAT solver completely enumerates all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order ten with two nontrivial relations in under 2 hours on a desktop machine, while Delisle's 2010 search used 11,700 CPU hours. Although computer hardware was slower in 2010, this alone cannot explain the improvement in the efficiency of our SAT-based search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two incidence problems for integral curves of vector fields. The first is an analogue of the Euclidean joints problem, in which lines are replaced by integral curves of smooth vector fields taken from some finite-dimensional set. The second is a bilinear and more rigid version of the first, in which we have two vector fields and one family of integral curves tangent to each and wish to know how many intersecting pairs are possible. In both cases, a curvature condition of H\"ormander makes possible nontrivial bounds on the number of incidences in terms of the number of curves.</description>

      <title>Parke-Taylor varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parke-Taylor functions are certain rational functions on the Grassmannian of lines encoding MHV amplitudes in particle physics. For $n$ particles there are $n!$ Parke-Taylor functions, corresponding to all orderings of the particles. Linear relations between these functions have been extensively studied in the last years. We here describe all non-linear polynomial relations between these functions in a simple combinatorial way and study the variety parametrized by them, called the Parke-Taylor variety. We show that the Parke-Taylor variety is linearly isomorphic to the log canonical embedding of the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ due to Keel and Tevelev, and that the intersection with the algebraic torus recovers the open part, $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. We give an explicit description of this isomorphism. Unlike the log canonical embedding, this Parke-Taylor embedding respects the symmetry of the $n$ marked points and is constructed in a single-step procedure, avoiding the intermediate embedding into a product of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Growth and identities of monogenic free adequate monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in inverse semigroup theory, we investigate the growth of and identities satisfied by free left and free two-sided adequate monoids. We explicitly compute the growth of the monogenic free left adequate monoid with the usual unary monoid generating set and show it has intermediate growth owing to a connection with integer partitions. In the two-sided case, we establish a lower bound on the (idempotent) growth rate of the monogenic free adequate monoid, showing that it grows exponentially. We completely classify the enriched identities satisfied by the monogenic free left adequate monoid and deduce that it satisfies the same monoid identities as the sylvester monoid. In contrast, we show that the monogenic free two-sided adequate monoid satisfies no non-trivial monoid identities.</description>

      <title>Parity of the partition function in quadratic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1&lt;D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</description>

      <title>Boolean Rank via Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) has many applications in data mining, bioinformatics, and network analysis. The goal of BMF is to decompose a given binary matrix as the Boolean product of two smaller binary matrices, revealing underlying structure in the data. When interpreting a binary matrix as the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph, BMF is equivalent to the NP-hard biclique cover problem.
  By approaching this problem through the lens of commutative algebra, we utilize algebraic structures and techniques--particularly the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of combinatorially defined ideals--to establish new lower bounds for Boolean matrix rank.</description>

      <title>Geometry of critical discrete structures: percolation on the hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider balls $\Lambda_n$ of growing volumes in the $d$-dimensional hierarchical lattice, and place edges independently between each pair of vertices $x\neq y\in\Lambda_n$ with probability $1-\exp(-\beta J(x, y) )$ where $J(x, y) \asymp \| x-y \|^{-\alpha}$ for some $0&lt;\alpha&lt;5d/6$. We identify the critical window for this model and establish the metric scaling limit within the critical window. More precisely, we show that the metric scaling limit of the maximal components is Brownian, and that this model belongs to the Erdos-Renyi universality class when $0&lt;\alpha&lt;5d/6$. It was recently conjectured by Hutchcroft [43, Section~7.1] that this model is a member of the Erdos-Renyi universality class when $\alpha\in(d, 4d/3]$, and we believe that this is also true for all $\alpha\in (0, d]$. This paper proves a first result in that direction. We further show that when $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2d/3$, the girth of each maximal component in the critical window is $\Omega_P(|\Lambda_n|^{1/3})$, contrary to the situation when $d&lt;\alpha\leq 4d/3$ where the girth equals $3$ .
  Our key tool is a universality principle proven in [10, 13]. Our proof technique can be adapted for the analogous problem on long-range percolation on the discrete torus provided an upper bound on the barely subcritical two-point function is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$.</description>

      <title>Whirling injections, surjections, and other functions between finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.02411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a certain action called "whirling" that can be defined on any family of functions between two finite sets equipped with a linear (or cyclic) ordering. Many maps of interest in dynamical algebraic combinatorics, such as rowmotion of order ideals, can be represented as a composition of "toggling" involutions, each of which modifies its object only locally. Similarly whirling is made up of locally-acting whirling maps which directly generalize toggles, but cycle through more than two possible outputs. In this first paper on whirling, we consider it as a map on subfamilies of functions between finite sets.
  For whirling acting on the set of injections or the set of surjections, we prove that within each whirling orbit, any two elements of the codomain appear as outputs of functions the same number of times. This result can be stated in terms of the homomesy phenomenon, which occurs when a statistic has the same average across every orbit. We further explore homomesy results and conjectures for whirling on restricted-growth words, which correspond to set partitions. These results extend the collection of combinatorial objects for which we have interesting dynamics and homomesy, and open the door to considering whirling in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1808.06095 we have introduced the Knuth class of the word recording a sequence of locations for repeated internal insertion operations in the Sagan-Stanley skew RSK correspondence, with no prescribed external insertion of new cells, to be a preserver for the $P$-tableau. As a consequence the Benkart-Sottile-Stroomer switching involution on ballot tableau pairs allows a realization as a recursive internal insertion procedure. This amounts to explain the various presentations of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters and their coincidence predicted by Pak and Vallejo with contributions by Danilov and Koshevoi. As an instance, the coincidence of LR commuters is instrumental on bijections between branching models.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in nonnesting permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00336v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnesting permutations are permutations of the multiset $\{1,1,2,2,\dots,n,n\}$ that avoid subsequences of the form $abba$ for any $a\neq b$. These permutations have recently been studied in connection to noncrossing (also called quasi-Stirling) permutations, which are those that avoid subsequences of the form $abab$, and in turn generalize the well-known Stirling permutations. Inspired by the work by Archer et al. on pattern avoidance in noncrossing permutations, we consider the analogous problem in the nonnesting case. We enumerate nonnesting permutations that avoid each set of two or more patterns of length 3, as well as those that avoid some sets of patterns of length 4. We obtain closed formulas and generating functions, some of which involve unexpected appearances of the Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. Our proofs rely on decompositions, recurrences, and bijections.</description>

      <title>On Zarankiewicz's Problem for Intersection Hypergraphs of Geometric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypergraph Zarankiewicz's problem, introduced by Erd\H{o}s in 1964, asks for the maximum number of hyperedges in an $r$-partite hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each part that does not contain a copy of $K_{t,t,\ldots,t}$. Erd\H{o}s obtained a near optimal bound of $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ for general hypergraphs. In recent years, several works obtained improved bounds under various algebraic assumptions -- e.g., if the hypergraph is semialgebraic.
  In this paper we study the problem in a geometric setting -- for $r$-partite intersection hypergraphs of families of geometric objects. Our main results are essentially sharp bounds for families of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and families of pseudo-discs. For axis-parallel boxes, we obtain the sharp bound $O_{d,r}(tn^{r-1}(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})^{d-1})$. The best previous bound was larger by a factor of about $(\log n)^{d(2^{r-1}-2)}$. For pseudo-discs, we obtain the bound $O_r(tn^{r-1}(\log n)^{r-2})$, which is sharp up to logarithmic factors. As this hypergraph has no algebraic structure, no improvement of Erd\H{o}s' 60-year-old $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ bound was known for this setting. Futhermore, even in the special case of discs for which the semialgebraic structure can be used, our result improves the best known result by a factor of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{\frac{2r-2}{3r-2}})$.
  To obtain our results, we use the recently improved results for the graph Zarankiewicz's problem in the corresponding settings, along with a variety of combinatorial and geometric techniques, including shallow cuttings, biclique covers, transversals, and planarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An injective $k$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a mapping $\phi$: $E(G)\rightarrow\{1,2,...,k\}$, such that $\phi(e)\ne\phi(e')$ if edges $e$ and $e'$ are at distance two, or are in a triangle. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an injective $k$-edge-coloring is called the injective chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_i'(G)$. In this paper, we prove that $\chi_i'(G)\le 7$ for every graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)\leq 4$ and mad$(G)&lt;\frac{8}{3}$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

      <title>Joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with antipodal shadings</title>

Abstract: The study of joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same symmetric shadings was recently initiated by Kitaev and Lv, where 75 of 80 potential joint equidistributions were proven. In this paper, we prove 112 out of 126 potential joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same minus antipodal shadings. As a byproduct, we present 562 joint equidistribution results for non-symmetric and non-minus-antipodal shadings. To achieve this, we construct bijections, find recurrence relations, and obtain generating functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the joint distributions of several pairs of mesh patterns are related to the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the rank polynomial of the lattice of order ideals of a loop fence poset is unimodal. These posets arise as the in the lattice of good matchings of loop graphs associated with notched arcs. Equivalently, such polynomials can be obtained by evaluating all coefficient variables in an F-polynomial at a single variable q. We also conclude that the rank polynomial of any tagged arc, whether plain or notched, is not only unimodal but also satisfies a symmetry condition known as almost interlacing. Furthermore, when the lamination consists of a single curve, the cluster expansion-evaluated by setting all cluster variables to 1 and all coefficient variables to q-is also unimodal. We conjecture that polynomials in this case are log-concave.</description>

      <title>All Ordinals are Cop-Robber Ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>

Abstract: We first prove that the ring of graph splines over an edge-labeled graph is isomorphic to the limit of a diagram associated to the edge-labeled graph. This is used to establish a local--global principle for graph splines. We then use this to prove that the module of graph splines on an edge-labeled graph over $k[x,y]$ is free when the graph is locally trivial or determined by a cycle over suitable open sets. Finally, we describe how deletion and contraction on an edge-labeled graph affect the spectrum of the ring of splines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite $(p,q)$-theorem, or an $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem, involving two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of sets, states that if in every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ sets that are intersected by some set in $\mathcal{G}$, then there is a finite set $S_{\mathcal{F}}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ such that for every $C\in\mathcal{F}$, there is a $B\in S_{\mathcal{F}}$ with $C\cap B\neq\emptyset$. We provide an example demonstrating that there is no $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem for piercing compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with lines by constructing a family $\mathcal{F}$ of compact convex sets such that it does not have a finite line transversal, but for any $t\in\mathbb{N}$, every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains $t$ sets that are pierced by a line.</description>

      <title>Property O and Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres properties in linear hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An oriented $k$-uniform hypergraph, or oriented $k$-graph, is said to satisfy Property O if, for every linear ordering of its vertex set, there is some edge oriented consistently with this order. The minimum number $f(k)$ of edges in a $k$-graph with Property O was first studied by Duffus, Kay, and R\"{o}dl, and later improved by Kronenberg, Kusch, Lamaison, Micek, and Tran. In particular, they established the bounds $k! + 1 \le f(k) \le \left(\lfloor\tfrac{k}{2}\rfloor+1 \right) k! - \lfloor\tfrac{k}{2}\rfloor(k-1)!$ for every $k \ge 2$.
  In this note, we extend the study of Property O to the linear setting. We determine the minimum number $f'(k)$ of edges in a linear $k$-graph up to a $\operatorname{poly}(k)$ multiplicative factor, showing that $\frac{(k!)^2}{2e^2k^4} \le f'(k) \le (1+o(1)) \cdot 4 k^6 \ln^2 k \cdot (k!)^2$. Our approach also yields bounds on the minimum number $n'(k)$ of vertices in an oriented linear $k$-graph with Property O. Additionally, we explore the minimum number of edges and vertices required in a linear $k$-graph satisfying the newly introduced Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres properties.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert depth of monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09450v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be the ring of polynomials over a field $K$. Given two monomial ideals $0\subset I\subsetneq J \subset S$, we present a new method to compute the Hilbert depth of $J/I$. As an application, we show that if $u\in S$ is a monomial regular of $S/I$, then $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/(I,u))\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)-1.$
  Also, we reprove the formula of the Hilbert depth of a squarefree Veronese ideal.</description>

      <title>Regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex semisimple linear algebraic group. Fix a subset $\Theta$ of simple roots. Given a lower ideal $I$ in positive roots, one can define the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$ in the full flag variety $G/B$. For a $\Theta$-ideal $I$ (which is a special lower ideal), we can define the regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ in the partial flag variety $G/P$. In this manuscript we first provide a summand formula and a product formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. It is a well-known result from Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand that the cohomology ring of the partial flag variety $G/P$ is isomorphic to the invariants in the cohomology ring of the full flag variety $G/B$ under an action of the parabolic Weyl group $W_\Theta$ generated by $\Theta$. We generalize this result to regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. More concretely, we give an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ and the $W_\Theta$-invariant subring of the cohomology ring of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$. Furthermore, we provide a description of the cohomology ring for a regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ in terms of the $W_\Theta$-invariants in the logarithmic derivation module of the ideal arrangement $\mathcal{A}_I$, which is a generalization of the result by Abe-Masuda-Murai-Sato with the author.</description>

      <title>Explicit Identities and new results for Infinite Series associated with the Ratio of Central Binomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some classes of infinite series involving central binomial coefficients, particularly focusing on those arising from ratios such as $\binom{2n}{n}\binom{4n}{2n}^{-1}$,$\binom{4n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}^{-1}$ and related expressions. We derive several new explicit identities and closed-form evaluations, building on and refining previous results by Bhandari (2022) and Adegoke et al. (2022).</description>

      <title>Global fluctuations for standard Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</description>

      <title>Random-projector quantum diagnostics of Ramsey numbers and a prime-factor heuristic for $R(5,5)=45$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a statistical framework for estimating Ramsey numbers by embedding two-color Ramsey instances into a $Z_2 \times Z_2$-graded Majorana algebra. This approach replaces brute-force enumeration with two randomized spectral diagnostics applied to operators of a given dimension d associated with Ramsey numbers: a linear projector $P_{lin}$ and an exponential map $P_{exp}(\alpha)$, suitable for both classical and quantum computation. In the diagonal case, both diagnostics identify R(5,5) at n=45. The quantum realizations act on a reduced module and therefore require only five data qubits plus a few ancillas via block-encoding/qubitization for R(5,5)=45, in stark contrast to the $\binom{n}{2} \approx 10^3$ logical qubits demanded by direct edge encodings. We also provide few-qubit estimates for R(6,6) and R(7,7), and propose a simple "prime-sequence" consistency heuristic that connects R(5,5)=45 to constrained diagonal growth. Our method echoes Erd\H{o}s's probabilistic paradigm, emphasizing randomized arguments rather than explicit colorings, and parallels the classical coin-flip approach to Ramsey bounds. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this framework to machine learning with a limited number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Sharp Online Hardness for Large Balanced Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is $\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality. While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>
