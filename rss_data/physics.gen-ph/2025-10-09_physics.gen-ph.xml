      <title>On the Invariant and Geometric Structure of the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the invariant structure of a Holomorphic Unified Field Theory in which gravity and gauge interactions arise from a single geometric framework. The theory is formulated on a product principal bundle, with one connection, and curvature equipped with a Hermitian field on a complexification of spacetime. From a single Diff(M) $\times$ G-invariant action, variation yields the Einstein and Yang-Mills equations together with their paired Bianchi identities. A compatibility condition is implemented either definitionally or through an auxiliary penalty functional. It enforces that the antisymmetric part of our Hermitian field is exactly the gauge field's curvature on the real slice.</description>

      <title>Gravitational deflection of charged massive particle around charged galactic wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a novel charged wormhole spacetime based on Yoshiaki Sofue's exponential dark matter density profile, referred to as the Charged Galactic Wormhole. Our previous work explored the deflection of light and massive chargeless particles in this spacetime. Building upon this foundation, we now extend our study to investigate the deflection of charged massive particles around the charged galactic wormhole, unveiling new insights and opening several promising avenues for future research. To analyze this phenomenon, we employ two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes the Rindler-Ishak method, leveraging the Jacobi metric to compute the particle trajectories with high precision. The second approach adopts the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, providing a geometric and topological perspective of the deflection process. A detailed comparison of the results from these two approaches is presented, highlighting their consistency and differences, along with the physical implications. This work provides deeper insights into the interaction of gravitational and electromagnetic forces around charged galactic wormholes and their influence on particle motion, contributing to the theoretical understanding of such exotic spacetime structures.</description>
