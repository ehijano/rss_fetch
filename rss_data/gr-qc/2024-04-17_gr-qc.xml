      <title>Simple, efficient method of calculating the Detweiler-Whiting singular field to very high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most self-force calculations rely, in one way or another, on representations of a particle's Detweiler- Whiting singular field. We present a simple method of calculating the singular field to high order in a local expansion in powers of distance from the particle. As a demonstration, we compute the singular field to 14th order in distance, 10 orders beyond the previous state of the art, in the simple case of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We provide the result in both a 4-dimensional form and a decomposed form suitable for use in an m-mode puncture scheme. Our method should have applications in overcoming bottlenecks in current self-force calculations at both first and second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-domain spectral method for self-force calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order self-force calculations will be critical for modelling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and they are now known to have high accuracy even for binaries with mass ratios $\sim 1:10$. Many of the challenges facing these calculations are related to slow convergence of spherical-harmonic (or spheroidal harmonic) mode sums in a region containing the small companion. In this paper, we begin to develop a multi-domain framework that can evade those problems. Building on recent work by Osburn and Nishimura, in the problematic region of spacetime we use a puncture scheme and decompose the punctured field equations into a basis of Fourier and azimuthal $m$ modes, avoiding a harmonic decomposition in the $\theta$ direction. Outside the problematic region, we allow for a complete spherical- or spheroidal-harmonic decomposition. As a demonstration, we implement this framework in the simple context of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our implementation utilizes several recent advances: a spectral method in each region, hyperboloidal compactification, and an extremely high-order puncture.</description>

      <title>Can a radiation gauge be horizon-locking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short Note, I answer the titular question: Yes, a radiation gauge can be horizon-locking. Radiation gauges are very common in black hole perturbation theory. It's also very convenient if a gauge choice is horizon-locking, i.e. the location of the horizon is not moved by a linear metric perturbation. Therefore it is doubly convenient that a radiation gauge can be horizon-locking, when some simple criteria are satisfied. Though the calculation is straightforward, it seemed useful enough to warrant writing this Note. Finally I show an example: the $\ell$ vector of the Hartle-Hawking tetrad in Kerr satisfies all the conditions for ingoing radiation gauge to keep the future horizon fixed.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, in special the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.</description>

      <title>Dark photon - dark energy stationary axisymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Ernst formalism, stationary axisymmetric black hole solution in Einstein-dark matter-dark energy gravity has been elaborated. The dark sector was chosen as dark photon concept, where an auxiliary U(1)-gauge field coupled to ordinary Maxwell one was introduced, while dark energy was modelled by the existence of positive cosmological constant. Refining our studies to the case of vanishing cosmological constant, the uniqueness theorem for the black hole in question has been proved.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Approach to the Vis-viva Equation on Schwarzschild Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modification to the vis-viva equation that accounts for general relativistic effects is introduced to enhance the accuracy of predictions of orbital motion and precession. The updated equation reduces to the traditional vis-viva equation under Newtonian conditions and is a more accurate tool for astrodynamics than the traditional equation. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the application potential of the modified vis-viva equation for more complex n-body systems. Spherical symmetry is assumed in this approach; however, this limitation could be removed in future research. This study is a pivotal step toward bridging classical and relativistic mechanics and thus makes an important contribution to the field of celestial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative correction to thermodynamics of conformally dressed 3D black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of corrected thermodynamics for the 3D black holes conformally coupled to scalar field up to non-perturbative level. We calculate the exponential correction to entropy arises due to the microstate counting for quantum states on the boundary. This exponential correction in entropy attributes to the other thermodynamical quantities also. We study the stability and phase transition for this system of black hole under the influence of non-perturbative correction. We also discuss the quantum work associated with exponential corrected entropy. Finally, we justify the results from the view point of thermodynamic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Einstein's Strong Principle of Equivalence we consider the effects of quantum mechanics to the gravity-like phenomena experienced by an observer in a uniformly accelerating motion in flat spacetime. Among other things, our model of quantum gravity, derived from the first principles, predicts the Unruh effect, and a discrete area spectrum for spacelike two-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of the evolution of the early universe in Einstein-Cartan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform the phase space analysis to investigate the evolution of the early universe in Einstein-Cartan theory. By studying the stability of critical points in dynamical system, it is found that there exist two stable critical points which represent an expanding solution and an Einstein static solution respectively. After analyzing the phase diagram of the dynamical system, we find that there may exist a bouncing universe, an oscillating universe or an Einstein static universe in the early time of universe. In addition, by assuming that the early universe filled by the radiation with $\omega= 1/3$ , the initial states of the early universe are Einstein static universe or oscillating universe. When the equation of state $\omega$ decreases with time, the universe can exit from the initial state and evolve into an expanding phase.</description>

      <title>Linear instability of hairy black holes in Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Horndeski theory gives the most general model of scalar-tensor theories. It draws a lot of attentions in recent years on its black holes, celestial dynamics, stability analysis, etc. It is important to notice that, for certain subclasses of Horndeski models, one can obtain analytic solutions to the background fields. This provides us with a good opportunity to investigate the corresponding stability problems in details. Specially, we may find out the constraints to the model or theory, under which the stability conditions can be satisfied. In this paper, we focus on a subclass of the Horndeski theory and a set of analytic background solutions are considered. On top of that, the odd-parity gravitational perturbation and the 2nd-order Lagrangian are investigated. With careful analysis, the instability is identified within the neighborhood of event horizon. We are thus able to exclude a specific geometry for the model. It is interesting to notice that, such an instability is implanted in the structure of the corresponding Lagrangian, and will not by erased by simply adding numerical constraints on the coupling parameters. As a starting point of our research, this current work provides insights into further exploration of Horndeski theories.</description>

      <title>A Mathematica program for numerically computing real and complex critical points in 4-dimensional Lorentzian spinfoam amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a comprehensive algorithm and a Mathematica program to construct boundary data and compute real and complex critical points in spinfoam amplitudes. Our approach covers both spacelike tetrahedra and triangles in the EPRL model and timelike tetrahedra and triangles in the Conrady-Hnybida extension, aiming at addressing a wide range of physical scenarios such as cosmology and black holes. Starting with a single 4-simplex, we explain how to numerically construct boundary data and corresponding real critical points from any nondegenerate 4-simplex geometry. Extending this to the simplicial complex, we demonstrate the algorithm for constructing boundary data and critical points using examples with two 4-simplices sharing an internal tetrahedron. By revisiting the $\Delta_3$ triangulation with curved geometry, we demonstrate the numerical computation of the real critical point corresponding to the flat geometry and the deformation to the complex critical points. Additionally, the program evaluates the spinfoam action at the critical points and compare to the Regge action.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative black hole in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of non-commutative Schwarzschild black holes in the context of massive gravity. According to the investigation, corresponding to a minimal mass, the black hole can have two horizons, one horizon, or no horizon at all. Our results imply the existence of a stable black hole remnant, whose mass can be uniquely calculated in terms of the non-commutative parameter $\theta$ and gravity mass $m$. Thermodynamic features such as heat capacity and Hawking temperature are studied. We also examine a scalar linear perturbation on the black hole. Quasinormal frequencies are computed via Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin(WKB) method with Pade improvement. All quasinormal frequencies considered in this work have a negative imaginary part. In the eikonal limit, we investigate the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent as a function of $M/\sqrt{\theta}$. Additionally, we explore the black hole's shadow across various model parameters. Our findings indicate that non-commutativity leads to a reduction in the black hole's shadow, with this effect exhibiting a nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of a massive graviton in the theory results in an increase in the black hole's shadow radius, particularly at greater observer distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of anti-symmetric tensor effects, which trigger the Lorentz symmetry breaking, on charged spherically symmetric black holes. Initially, we address an overview of the model, laying the groundwork for deriving solutions to black holes. With this, we analyze the horizons, critical orbits, and geodesics. We compute quasinormal modes with a particular emphasis on vectorial perturbations. In addition, we derive the Hawking temperature to perform the calculation of the remnant mass. Additionally, we estimate the lifetime of the black holes until they reach their final stage after the evaporation process. Furthermore, we explore the emission rate, and the deflection angle. Finally, we investigate the correlation between quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Scaling symmetry, Smarr relation, and the extended first law in lower-dimensional Lovelock gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00620v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that lower-dimensional versions of Lovelock gravity exist as scalar-tensor theories that are examples of Horndeski gravity. We study the thermodynamics of the static black hole solutions in these theories up to cubic order through Euclidean methods. Considering solutions with spherical, planar and hyperbolic event horizons ($k=+1, 0, -1$), we show that the universality of the thermodynamics for planar black holes ($k=0$) and the extended 1st law that include the variation of the couplings together with their associated potentials hold also in lower dimensions. We find that in $D=4, 6$ where the 2nd- and the 3rd-order Lovelock Lagrangians are boundary terms respectively, the Smarr relation is modified since the entropy is not a homogenous function in these dimensions. We also present a derivation of the Smarr relation and its modified version based on the global scaling properties of the reduced action that is used to obtain the solutions consistently. Unlike the other hairy black hole solutions that have been analyzed before, despite the terms in the reduced action that break the scaling symmetry, the derivation still follows from a conserved Noether charge.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Idealization Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stephen Hawking's derivation of Hawking radiation relied on one particular spacetime model, that of a star collapsing into a black hole which then remains in existence forever. He then argued that Hawking radiation implies this model should be thrown away in favour of a different model, that of an evaporating black hole. This aspect of Hawking's argument is an example of an idealization that is pervasive in the literature on black hole thermodynamics, but which has not yet been widely discussed by philosophers. The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of Hawking's idealization, and to show a sense in which it leads to a paradox. After identifying this idealization paradox in classic derivations of Hawking radiation, I go on to show how various research programmes in black hole thermodynamics can be viewed as possible resolutions to the paradox. I give an initial analysis of the prospects for success of these various resolutions, and show how they shed light on both the philosophical foundations of both Hawking radiation on the nature of idealizations in physics.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreactions in (A)dS3 massive gravity and logarithmic asymptotic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between higher curvature terms and the backreaction of quantum fluctuations in 3-dimensional massive gravity in asymptotically (Anti-)de Sitter space. We focus on the theory at the special point of the parameter space where the two maximally symmetric vacua coincide. In the case of positive cosmological constant, this corresponds to the partially massless point, at which the classical theory admits de Sitter black holes and exhibits an extra conformal symmetry at linear level. We explicitly find the quantum corrected black hole geometry in the semiclassical approximation and show that it induces a relaxation of the standard asymptotic conditions. Nonetheless, the new asymptotic behavior is still preserved by an infinite-dimensional algebra, which, in addition to Virasoro, contains logarithmic supertranslations. Finally, we show that all the results we obtain for the quadratic massive gravity theory can be extended to theories including cubic and quartic terms in the curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct higher-derivative gravity theories in three dimensions that admit holographic $c$-theorems and exhibit a unique maximally symmetric vacuum, at arbitrary order $n$ in the curvature. We show that these theories exhibit special properties, the most salient ones being the decoupling of ghost modes around Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the enhancement of symmetries at linearized level, and the existence of a one-parameter generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole that, while being asymptotically AdS, is not of constant curvature but rather exhibits a curvature singularity. For such black holes, we provide a holographic derivation of their thermodynamics. This gives a microscopic picture of black hole thermodynamics for non-supersymmetric solutions, of non-constant curvature in higher-derivative theories of arbitrary order in the curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic duality conjectures a relation between strongly coupled quantum systems and quantum gravity in higher-dimensional spacetimes. Gravitational theories in two and three dimensions are meaningful examples for classical and quantum exploration due to their unique characteristics, notably the absence of propagating bulk degrees of freedom and the presence of only boundary degrees of freedom, distinguishing them from higher-dimensional counterparts. These gravitational theories exhibit complex interactions when the bulk spacetime has a finite size, regulated by Zamolodchikov's double-trace irrelevant $T\overline{T}$ operator.
  This thesis aims to gain a holographic understanding of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and JT gravity under the influence of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Under a finite radial cutoff, these theories exhibit perturbative behavior that implies the emergence of the Nambu-Goto action for the corresponding boundary graviton action. We also conducted semi-classical calculations of observables related to finite-cutoff gravity and its dual $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT description, including correlation functions involving stress tensors and gravitational Wilson lines, along with an analysis of their supersymmetric extensions. Additionally, we explored the implications of general stress tensor deformations within field-theoretic and holographic settings.
  This thesis integrates previously adapted publications while also pioneering new ground, notably exploring the definition of a quantum $T\overline{T}$ operator beyond two dimensions with $\frac{1}{N}$ corrections, investigating quantum-corrected higher point correlators for a planar boundary, and offering insights into a two-dimensional spherical boundary at a finite cutoff. Furthermore, throughout the thesis, we show more details in calculations at various points.</description>

      <title>The semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity via holography and mini-superspace approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the complex geometries dual to the semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity with positive or negative cosmological constant. We examine the semi-classical saddles in Liouville field theory and interpret them in terms of gravity theory. For this, we describe the gravity theory by Chern Simons theory and classify the possible saddles based on homotopy group argument. We further realize the semi-classical saddles using the mini-superspace model of quantum gravity and explicitly determine the integral contour. In the case of positive cosmological constant, we recovered the geometry used for no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking. In the case of negative cosmological constant, the geometry can be identified with Euclidean anti-de Sitter space attached with imaginary radius spheres. The geometry should be unphysical and several arguments on this issue are provided. Partial results were already presented in our earlier letter, and more detailed derivations and explanations on the results are given along with additional results. In particular, we reproduce the classical Liouville action from the Chern-Simons formulation of dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory is about the geometry of internal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the strong equivalence principle is underpinned by a geometrical interpretation of fields on spacetime: all fields and bodies probe the same geometry. This geometric interpretation implies that the parallel transport of all spacetime tensors and spinors is dictated by a single affine connection. Can something similar be said about gauge theory? Agreed, in gauge theory different symmetry groups rule the interactions of different types of charges, so we cannot expect to find the same kind of universality found in the gravitational case. Nonetheless, the parallel transport of all the fields that are charged under the same symmetry group is dictated by a single 'gauge connection', and they all transform jointly under a gauge transformation. Is this kind of 'restricted universality' as geometrically underpinned as in general relativity? Here I argue that it is. The key difference is that the gauge geometry concerns 'internal', as opposed to 'external', spaces. The gauge symmetry of the standard model is thus understood as merely the automorphism group of an internal geometric structure -- $C^3\otimes C^2\otimes C^1$ endowed with an orientation and canonical inner product -- in the same way as spacetime symmetries (such as Poincare transformations), are understood as the automorphism group of an external geometric structure (respectively, a Minkowski metric). And the Ehresmann connection can then be understood as determining parallelism for this internal geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes for multiple axion fields with comparable masses, motivated by string theory constructions, which typically exhibit a large number of light axions, with a broad range of masses. We show, in particular, that even though superradiant clouds for the heavier axion species grow faster, they are eventually reabsorbed by the black hole as the latter amplifies the lighter axion field(s), analogously to the dynamics of different species competing for the same resources in an ecosystem. We also incorporate in our study the effects of accretion and gravitational wave emission. We further demonstrate that the existence of multiple axion species with comparable masses may have a substantial impact on the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by axion clouds around black hole binary merger remnants, which could be probed with planned detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of scalar field dark matter interacting with dark energy. Adopting a fluid description of the dark matter field in the regime of rapid oscillations, we find that the equation of state for dark matter is non-zero and even becomes increasingly negative at late times during dark energy domination. Furthermore, the speed of sound of dark matter is non-vanishing at all length scales, and a non-adiabatic pressure contribution arises. The results indicate that there are still unexplored possible interactions within the dark sector that lead to novel background effects and can impact structure formation processes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation at the Crossroads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of Cosmic Inflation to explain the latest Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data is assessed by performing Bayesian model comparison within the landscape of nearly three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation. We present the first Bayesian data analysis based on the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra. In particular, the fourth Hubble-flow function $\epsilon_4$ remains unbounded while the third function verifies, at two-sigma, $\epsilon_{3}\in[-0.4,0.5]$, which is perfectly compatible with the slow-roll predictions for the running of the spectral index. We also observe some residual excess of $B$-modes within the BICEP/Keck data favoring, at a non-statistically significant level, non-vanishing primordial tensor modes: $\log(\epsilon_{1}) &gt; -3.9$, at $68\%$ confidence level. Then, for 283 models of single-field inflation, we compute the Bayesian evidence, the Bayesian dimensionality and the marginalized posteriors of all the models' parameters, including the ones associated with the reheating era. The average information gain on the reheating parameter $R_\mathrm{reh}$ reaches $1.3 \pm 0.18$ bits, which is more than a factor two improvement compared to the first Planck data release. As such, inflationary model predictions cannot meet data accuracy without specifying, or marginalizing over, the reheating kinematics. We also find that more than $40\%$ of the scenarios are now strongly disfavored, which shows that the constraining power of cosmological data is winning against the increase of the number of proposed models. In addition, about $20\%$ of all models have evidences within the most probable region and are all favored according to the Jeffreys' scale of Bayesian evidences.</description>

      <title>Frequency space derivation of linear and non-linear memory gravitational wave signals from eccentric binary orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect in gravitational wave (GW) signals is the phenomenon, wherein the relative position of two inertial GW detectors undergoes a permanent displacement owing to the passage of GWs through them. Measurement of the memory signal is an important target for future observations as it establishes a connection between observations with field-theoretic results like the soft-graviton theorems. Theoretically, the memory signal is predicted at the leading order quadrupole formula for sources like binaries in hyperbolic orbits. This can be in the realm of observations by Advanced LIGO, Einstein-Telescope, or LISA for black-holes with masses $\sim$ $O(10^3 \, M_\odot$) scattered by the super-massive black-hole at the galactic center. Apart from the direct memory component there is a non-linear memory signal in the secondary GW emitted from the primary GW chirp-signals emitted by coalescing binaries. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum using the field-theoretic method by computing the scattering amplitudes for eccentric elliptical and hyperbolic binary orbits. The field theoretic calculation gives us the gravitational waveforms of linear and non-linear memory signals directly in the frequency space. The frequency domain templates are useful for extracting signals from the data. We compare our results with other calculations of linear and non-linear memory signals in literature and point out novel features we find in our calculations like the presence of $\log(\omega)$ terms in the linear memory from hyperbolic orbits.</description>

      <title>The chaotic behavior of the Bianchi IX model under the influence of quantum effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum analysis of the vacuum Bianchi IX model is performed, focusing in particular on the chaotic nature of the system. The framework constructed here is general enough for the results to apply in the context of any theory of quantum gravity, since it includes only minimal approximations that make it possible to encode the information of all quantum degrees of freedom in the fluctuations of the usual anisotropy parameters. These fluctuations are described as canonical variables that extend the classical phase space. In this way, standard methods for dynamical systems can be applied to study the chaos of the model. Two specific methods are applied that are suitable for time-reparameterization invariant systems. First, a generalized version of the Misner-Chitre variables is constructed, which provides an isomorphism between the quantum Bianchi IX dynamics and the geodesic flow on a suitable Riemannian manifold, extending, in this way, the usual billiard picture. Secondly, the fractal dimension of the boundary between points with different outcomes in the space of initial data is numerically analyzed. While the quantum system remains chaotic, the main conclusion is that its strength is considerably diminished by quantum effects as compared to its classical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical model of a parabolic screen illuminating a black hole is proposed. This allows to avoid naturally the appearance of edge effects associated with photons moving along the plane of the screen. The temperature distribution along the radius of the screen corresponds to that for a relativistic disk (Novikov-Thorne disk). It is shown that the structure of the emerging black hole shadow differs significantly from the case when the photon source is a remote screen, since in the model considered, the photons subjected to strong gravitational lensing of the black hole are emitted by the "back side" of the screen, which would not be visible in the absence of a black hole. In the thin screen approximation, the shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole has been constructed in cases when the angle between the axis of symmetry of the illuminating screen and the direction towards the observer is 5, 30, 60, and 80 degrees. For the Kerr black hole, images are shown for angles of 60 and 80 degrees.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we generalize the Fokker-Planck equation to two-dimensional cases, including potential functions with periodic boundary conditions and piecewise-defined structures, to analyze the probability distribution in multi-field inflationary models. We employ the spectral method for spatial derivatives and the Crank-Nicolson method for the time evolution to solve the equation numerically for the slow-roll inflation. We find that the distribution in the Fokker-Planck equation was determined by the two-dimensional potential combined slow-roll parameters. And the volume weighting effect makes the distribution in the Fokker-Planck Volume equation is determined by the potential.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new geometric inequality that relates the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass of initial data to a quasilocal angular momentum of a marginally future trapped surface inner boundary. The inequality is expressed in terms of a 1-spinor, which satisfies an intrinsic first-order Dirac-type equation. Furthermore, we show that if the initial data is axisymmetric, then the divergence-free vector used to define the quasilocal angular momentum cannot be a Killing field of the generic boundary.</description>

      <title>Topological Interpretation of Black Hole Phase Transition in Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes are studied using Duan's $\phi-$ field topological current theory, where black holes are treated as topological defects in the thermodynamic parameter space. The kinetics of thermodynamic defects are studied using Duan's bifurcation theory. In this picture, a first-order phase transition between small/large black hole phases is interpreted as the interchange of winding numbers between the defects as a result of some action at a distance.We observe a first-order phase transition between small/large black holes for $D=5$ Gauss-Bonnet theory similar to Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in AdS space. This implies that these black hole solutions share the same topology and phase structure. We have also studied the phase transition of neutral black holes in $D\geq 6$ and found a transition between unstable small and large stable black hole phases similar to the case of neutral black holes in AdS space. Recently, it has been conjectured that black holes with similar topological structure exhibit the same thermodynamic properties. Our results strengthen the conjecture by connecting the topological nature of black holes to phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion and acceleration around Kerr-MOG black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important issues in relativistic astrophysics is to explain the origin mechanisms of (ultra)high energy charged particle components of cosmic rays. Black holes (BHs) being huge reservoirs of (gravitational) energy can be candidates for such particle sources. The main idea of this work is to study the effects of scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) on particle acceleration by examining charged particle dynamics and their acceleration through the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) near magnetized Kerr-MOG BHs. First, we study the horizon structure of the BH. Also, we study the effective potential to gain insight into the stability of circular orbits. Our results show that the magnetic field can extend the region of stable circular orbits, whereas the STVG parameter reduces the {instability} of the circular orbit. The motion of charged particles around the magnetized BH reveals various feasible regimes of the ionized Keplerian disk behavior. Thus, from the examination of particle trajectories we observe that at fixed values of other parameters, the Schwarzschild BH captures the test particle; in the case of Kerr BH, the test particle escapes to infinity or is captured by the BH, while in Kerr-MOG BH, the test particle is trapped in some region around BH and starts orbiting it. On investigating the MPP, we found that with increasing magnetic field, the behavior of orbits becomes more chaotic. As a result, the particle escapes to infinity more quickly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum hair associated with coherent states describing slowly rotating black holes and show how it can be naturally related with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and with 1-loop quantum corrections of the metric for the (effectively) non-rotating case. We also estimate corrections induced by such quantum hair to the temperature of the Hawking radiation through the tunnelling method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the thermal inflationary model, we introduce stochastic effects, incorporating a cutoff parameter $\sigma$ which distinguishes between quantum and classical modes. Testing the model against Planck 2018 data, we observe a preference for a non-zero $\sigma$ at least at 68\% C.L., suggesting the classicalization of most modes and providing a theoretical foundation for the quantum to classical transition. As a result of introducing the stochastic effects, we find that the solution to the large-scale power deficit requires a lower comoving temperature of inflaton.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves in non-singular matter bouncing cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel model-independent generic mechanism for primordial black hole formation within the context of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology. In particular, considering a short duration transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the potential bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailed in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for non-circularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries: the importance of radiation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated version of the TEOBResumS-Dali effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for spin aligned binaries on non-circularized orbits. Recently computed 4PN (nonspinning) terms are incorporated in the waveform and radiation reaction. The model is informed by a restricted sample ($\sim60$) of spin-aligned, quasi-circular, Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. In the quasi-circular limit, the model displays EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{\cal F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ (with median~ $1.06\times 10^{-3}$) (with Advanced LIGO noise and in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) for the dominant $\ell=m=2$ mode all over the 534 spin-aligned configurations available through the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime catalog of NR waveforms. Similar figures are also obtained with the 28 public eccentric SXS simulations and good compatibility between EOB and NR scattering angles is found. The quasi-circular limit of TEOBResumS-Dali is also found to be highly consistent with the TEOBResumS-GIOTTO quasi-circular model. We then systematically explore the importance of NR-tuning {\it also} the radiation reaction of the system. When this is done, the median of the distribution of quasi-circular ${\bar{\cal F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}$ is lowered to $3.92\times 10^{-4}$, though balanced by a tail up to $\sim 0.1$ for large, positive spins. The same is true for the eccentric-inspiral datasets. We conclude that an improvement of the analytical description of the spin-dependent flux (and its interplay with the conservative part) is likely to be the cornerstone to lower the EOB/NR unfaithfulness below the $10^{-4}$ level all over the parameter space, thus grazing the current NR uncertainties as well as the expected needs for next generation of GW detector like Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>The HI intensity mapping power spectrum: insights from recent measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurements of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum were recently made using the MeerKAT telescope. These measurements are on nonlinear scales, at redshifts 0.32 and 0.44. We develop a formalism for modelling small-scale power in redshift space, within the context of the mass-weighted HI halo model framework. This model is consistent with the latest findings from surveys on the HI-halo mass relation. In order to model nonlinear scales, we include the 1-halo, shot-noise and finger-of-god effects. Then we apply the model to the MeerKAT auto-correlation data, finding that the model provides a good fit to the data at redshift 0.32, but the data may indicate some evidence for an adjustment at $z \sim 0.44$. Such an adjustment can be achieved by an increase in the HI abundance or halo model bias.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. Central to this proposal is the result that in a $4+n$ dimensional theory with $n$ compact dimensions a tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states contributes an amount $m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ to the vacuum energy $\rho_4$, where $m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the KK scale of the tower. We show that the result $\rho_4 \sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ comes from a mistreatment of the asymptotics of the loop momenta in the $4+n$ original theory. When the latter are correctly treated, new UV-sensitive terms appear in $\rho_4$ that invalidate the prediction of the dark dimension. We also show that, despite recent claims to the contrary, it is always possible to perform consistent effective field theory calculations that include only a finite number of tower states.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays and Primordial Black Holes from a Supercooled Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit realistic model featuring a supercooled phase transition, which allows us to explain the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, is constructed. In this model the phase transition corresponds to radiative symmetry breaking (and mass generation) in a dark sector featuring a dark photon associated with the broken symmetry. The completion of the transition is ensured by a non-minimal coupling between gravity and the order parameter and fast reheating occurs thanks to a preheating phase. Finally, it is also shown that the model leads to primordial black hole production.</description>

      <title>On the dilation current in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ gravity in the metric-affine framework, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the divergence of the dilation current appearing in the hypermomentum tensor. We assume only linear couplings between the general affine connection and the matter fields (minimal coupling) and break projective invariance to preserve a nonvanishing dilation current. For $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ linear in $\mathcal{D}$ the dilation current dependence in the function $F(R,\mathcal{D})$ does not contribute to the field equations of the theory.
  We show that, on the other hand, in more complicated cases (e.g., considering the function $F(R,\mathcal{D})=R+\alpha \mathcal{D}^2$), the $\mathcal{D}$ contribution to the metric field equations is nontrivial and can affect the cosmology of the theory.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few to ten hours from nearby galactic nuclei. The origin of QPEs is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk model, where the disk is formed from a previous tidal disruption event (TDE). In this EMRI+TDE disk model, the QPEs are the result of collisions between a TDE disk and a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of EMRIs which are one of the primary targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. Taking GSN 069 as an example, we find the EMRI wherein is of low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.1$ at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level) and semi-major axis about $O(10^2)$ gravitational radii of the central SMBH, which is consistent with the prediction of the wet EMRI formation channel, while incompatible with alternatives.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>
