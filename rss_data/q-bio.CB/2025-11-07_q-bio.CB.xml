      <title>Diffusion Dynamics in Biofilms with Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A biofilm is a self-contained community of bacteria that uses signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to coordinate responses through the process of quorum sensing. Biofilms exhibit a dual role that drives interest in both combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and leveraging their potential in bioprocessing, since their products can have commercial potential. Previous work has demonstrated how the distinct anisotropic channel geometry in some biofilms affects AIs propagation therein. In this paper, a 2D anisotropic biofilm channel model is extended to be a time-varying channel (TVC), in order to represent the diffusion dynamics during the maturation phase when water channels develop. Since maturation is associated with the development of anisotropy, the time-varying model captures the shift from isotropic to anisotropic diffusion. Particle-based simulation results illustrate how the TVC is a hybrid scenario incorporating propagation features of both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid behavior aligns with biofilm maturation. Further study of the TVC includes characterization of the mutual information (MI), which reveals that an increased AI count, reduced transmitter -- receiver distance, greater degree of anisotropy, and shorter inter-symbol interference lengths increase the MI. Finally, a brief dimensional analysis demonstrates the scalability of the anisotropic channel results for larger biofilms and timescales.</description>

      <title>CAR T Cells from Code to Clinic: Framing Modeling Approaches with Current Translational Research Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has transformed immunotherapy for resistant cancers, yet it faces major limitations such as lack of persistence, toxicity, exhaustion, and antigen-negative relapse. Enhancing CAR T cells with genetic circuitry and synthetic receptors offers solutions to some of these problems, but often the theoretical design space is too large to explore experimentally. Mathematical modeling offers a powerful framework for addressing these translational bottlenecks by linking mechanistic understanding to design optimization and clinical application.
  This perspective embeds modeling methodologies within the therapeutic problems they aim to solve, framing the discussion around key translational challenges rather than modeling techniques. We critically evaluate the strengths, limitations, and data gaps of current approaches emphasizing how modeling supports the development of safer and more effective therapies. We highlight emerging approaches such as multiscale modeling, control theory, and data-driven methods that leverage high-dimensional datasets to guide predictive design, and we point toward underexplored areas in immune cell therapy including CAR NK and CAR macrophages as future modeling frontiers. We hope that the themes explored in this perspective will encourage readers to refine predictive models, enabling researchers to optimize CAR T cell therapies at the genetic, cellular, microenvironmental, and patient level to enhance their clinical performance.</description>
