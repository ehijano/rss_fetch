      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>

      <title>The Future of the Laser Lightning Rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of high average, high peak power lasers has revived the effort of using lasers as a potential tool to influence natural lightning. Although impressive, the current progress in laser lightning control technology may only be the beginning of a phase involving a positive feedback between powerful laser development and atmospheric research. In this review paper, we critically evaluate the past, present and future of the Laser Lightning Rod Technology (LLRT) approach, considering both technological and scientific significance in atmospheric research.</description>

      <title>On the bubble-bubbleless ocean continuum and its meaning for the lidar equation: Lidar measurement of underwater bubble properties during storm conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the NRL shipboard lidar and the first lidar dataset of underwater bubbles. The meaning of these lidar observations, the algorithms used and their current limitations are discussed. The derivation of the lidar multiple scattering regime is derived from the lidar observations and theory. The detection of the underwater bubble presence and their depth is straightforward to estimate from the depolarized laser return. This dataset strongly suggest that the whitecaps term in the lidar equation formalism needs to be revisited. Void fraction retrieval is possible and the algorithm is stable with a simple ocean backscatter lidar system. The accuracy of the void fraction retrieval will increase significantly with future developments.</description>

      <title>Polarized Adding Method of Discrete Ordinate Approximation for Ultraviolet-Visible and Near-Infrared Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization characteristics of atmospheric scattering are important and should not be ignored in radiative transfer simulations. In this study, a new vector radiative transfer model called the polarized adding method of discrete ordinate approximation (POLDDA) is proposed for use in remote sensing applications for ultraviolet-visible and near-infrared spectra. The single-layer radiative transfer process and inhomogeneous multi-layer connection are solved using the discrete ordinate method (DOM) and adding methods, respectively. By combining the advantages of DOM and the adding method, the Stokes vector (including the I-, Q-, U-, and V-components) calculated using the new method conforms to the results of PolRadtran/RT3, whether in a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere or the water cloud case. Moreover, the relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of the Stokes vector for the test cases between MYSTIC and the new method or RT3 prove the accuracy of the proposed method. Meanwhile, the new method has a higher computational efficiency than RT3, particularly for an atmosphere with a large scattering optical depth. Unlike RT3, the computation time of the proposed method does not increase with the optical depth of each layer.</description>

      <title>ClimODE: Climate and Weather Forecasting with Physics-informed Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate and weather prediction traditionally relies on complex numerical simulations of atmospheric physics. Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art.</description>

      <title>Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to merge precipitation data over mountainous area in Sierra Nevada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale. The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC). The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>
