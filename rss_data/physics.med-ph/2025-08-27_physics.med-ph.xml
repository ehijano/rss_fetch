      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512x512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high dose rate 6 MeV electron irradiation generates stable [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals suitable for medical imaging with dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by &gt;10^4-fold, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans. dDNP mechanistically takes place at ~1K, and requires unpaired electrons and microwaves. These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as UV irradiation, generate lower polarisation and require cryogenic transport. We present ultra-high-dose-rate electron irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation (17%) to trityl radicals used clinically (19%) through a novel mechanism we believe to involve partial ordering, and electron-electron interactions. Owing to the large radiation doses required, this process is sterilising, permits imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo in the rat kidney, and may aid clinically translating dDNP.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Demagnetizing Tensors in Arbitrary Orientations of General Ellipsoid: Implications for MRI Safety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the behaviour of demagnetizing tensors for general ellipsoids under arbitrary rotations in homogeneous magnetic fields. The work is motivated by the concerns in magnetic resonance imaging safety and their practical evaluation in clinical environments. Whereas demagnetizing tensor is a well-defined concept in the principal axes, its transformation under three-dimensional reorientation is often overlooked - a justifiable omission for solutions derived from Poisson equation, where the tensor can be directly rotated. However, this does not hold for common approximations, where such tensor is not explicitly defined. This work demonstrates the validity of directly rotating the orthogonal basis solutions, derived from Poissons equation, and uses the procedure to evaluate a practical approximation, based on orthogonal area-projections. The tensor rotation approach is also applied to generalize force and torque calculations for ellipsoids under three-dimensional re-orientation. The results show an exact match for translation force and torque when compared to the standard single axis rotation. Additionally, a unique connection to the well-known MRI magic angle is found as the point of convergence for prolate spheroid aspect ratios while solving the corresponding saturation field magnitudes. Finally, the evaluated approximate method was demonstrated to perform fairly across prolate and oblate spheroids. Similar approximations might extend to irregular shapes, but numerical validation would likely remain preferable due to the complexity of internal field distributions.</description>

      <title>Objective Task-based Evaluation of Quantitative Medical Imaging Methods: Emerging Frameworks and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need, multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks in the context of PET.</description>

      <title>Handcrafted vs. Deep Radiomics vs. Fusion vs. Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review of Machine Learning -Based Cancer Outcome Prediction in PET and SPECT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features (HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data (29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines, improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of grey matter has long been a key focus in neuroscience, as cell morphology varies by type and can be affected by neurological conditions. Understanding these variations is essential for studying brain function and disease. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for examining cellular microstructure in vivo. However, for dMRI to accurately reflect cellular features, it is crucial to determine which aspects of morphology influence its measurements. Proper interpretation of dMRI data depends on understanding its sensitivity to different cellular characteristics.
  Despite growing interest in cellular morphology, there has been no systematic report on the key features defining different neural cell types. To address this, we analyzed over 11,500 three-dimensional cellular reconstructions across three species and nine cell types, establishing reference values for critical morphological traits. These traits fall into three categories: structural features that define the cell's skeletal framework, shape features that describe spatial organization, and topological features that break down cellular structure to distinguish cell types. Beyond reporting these reference values, we examine their relevance for dMRI, identifying which neural features dMRI can detect and which cell types may be distinguishable. To complement the statistical analysis, we also provide high resolution 3D surface meshes representative of each cell type and species.
  This work provides essential benchmarks for grey matter research, offering new guidelines on linking neuroimaging measurements to neurobiology. These reference values will be a valuable resource for neuroscientists and neuroimaging researchers, aiding in the interpretation of imaging data and the refinement of brain tissue models.</description>
