      <title>Modelling the random spreading of fake news through a two-dimensional time-inhomogeneous birth-death process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional time-inhomogeneous birth-death process to model the time-evolution of fake news in a population. The two components of the process represent, respectively, (i) the number of individuals (say spreaders) who know the rumor and intend to spread it, and (ii) the number of individuals (say inactives) who have forgotten the rumor previously received. We employ the probability generating function-based approach to obtain the moments and the covariance of the two-dimensional process. We also analyze a new adimensional index to study the correlation between the two components. Some special cases are considered in which both the expected numbers of spreaders and inactives are equal to suitable sigmoidal curves, which are often adopted in modelling growth phenomena. Finally, we provide an application based on real data related to the diffusion of fake news, in which the optimal choice of the sigmoidal curve that fit the datasets is based on the minimization of the mean square error and of the relative absolute error.\</description>

      <title>Pathwise non-uniqueness for Brownian motion in a quadrant with oblique reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Skorokhod equation in the closed first quadrant: \[ X_t=x_0+ B_t+\int_0^t{\bf v}(X_s)\, dL_s,\] where $B_t$ is standard 2-dimensional Brownian motion, $X_t$ takes values in the quadrant for all $t$, and $L_t$ is a process that starts at 0, is non-decreasing and continuous, and increases only at those times when $X_t$ is on the boundary of the quadrant. Suppose ${\bf v}$ equals $(-a_1,1)$ on the positive $x$ axis, equals $(1,-a_2)$ on the positive $y$ axis, and ${\bf v}(0)$ points into the closed first quadrant. Let $\theta_i=\arctan a_i$, $i=1,2$. It is known that there exists a solution to the Skorokhod equation for all $t\geq 0$ if and only if $\theta_1+\theta_2&lt;\pi/2$ and moreover the solution is unique if $|a_1a_2|&lt;1$.
  Suppose now that $\theta_1+\theta_2&lt;\pi/2$, $\theta_2&lt;0$, $\theta_1&gt;-\theta_2&gt;0$ and $|a_1a_2|&gt;1$. We prove that for a large class of $(a_1,a_2)$, namely those for which \[\frac{\log|a_1|+\log|a_2|}{a_1+a_2}&gt;\pi/2,\] pathwise uniqueness for the Skorokhod equation fails to hold.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov SPDEs with H\"older continuous coefficients: existence, uniqueness, ergodicity, exponential mixing and limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well as the ergodicity and exponential mixing to invariant measures, and limit theorems for a class of McKean-Vlasov SPDEs characterized by H\"lder continuity. We rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for a specific class of finite-dimensional systems with H\"older continuous coefficients. Extending these results to the infinite-dimensional counterparts using the Galerkin projection technique. Additionally, we explore the properties of the solutions, including time homogeneity, the Markov and the Feller property. Building upon these properties, we examine the exponential ergodicity and mixing of invariant measures under Lyapunov conditions. Finally, within the framework of coefficients meeting the criteria of H\"lder continuity and Lyapunov conditions, alongside the uniform mixing property of invariant measures, we establish the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the solution and obtain estimates of corresponding convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing in Sparse Random Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the community detection problem in Bayesian inference, as well as the recent explosion of interest in spin glasses from statistical physics, we study the classical Glauber dynamics for sampling from Ising models with sparse random interactions. It is now well-known that when the interaction matrix has spectral diameter less than $1$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $O(n\log n)$ steps. Unfortunately, such criteria fail dramatically for interactions supported on arguably the most well-studied sparse random graph: the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, due to the presence of almost linearly many outlier eigenvalues of unbounded magnitude.
  We prove that for the \emph{Viana--Bray spin glass}, where the interactions are supported on $G(n,d/n)$ and randomly assigned $\pm\beta$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time with high probability as long as $\beta \le O(1/\sqrt{d})$, independent of $n$. We further extend our results to random graphs drawn according to the $2$-community stochastic block model, as well as when the interactions are given by a "centered" version of the adjacency matrix. The latter setting is particularly relevant for the inference problem in community detection. Indeed, we build on this result to demonstrate that Glauber dynamics succeeds at recovering communities in the stochastic block model in an upcoming paper.
  The primary technical ingredient in our proof is showing that with high probability, a sparse random graph can be decomposed into two parts --- a \emph{bulk} which behaves like a graph with bounded maximum degree and a well-behaved spectrum, and a \emph{near-forest} with favorable pseudorandom properties. We then use this decomposition to design a localization procedure that interpolates to simpler Ising models supported only on the near-forest, and then execute a pathwise analysis to establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to compute (super) hedging costs in rather general fi- nancial market models with transaction costs in discrete-time ? Despite the huge literature on this topic, most of results are characterizations of the super-hedging prices while it remains difficult to deduce numerical procedure to estimate them. We establish here a dynamic programming principle and we prove that it is possible to implement it under some conditions on the conditional supports of the price and volume processes for a large class of market models including convex costs such as order books but also non convex costs, e.g. fixed cost models.</description>

      <title>Absolute zeta functions and periodicity of quantum walks on cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, absolute zeta functions can be considered as zeta functions over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This study presents a connection between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions. In this paper, we focus on Hadamard walks and $3$-state Grover walks on cycle graphs. The Hadamard walks and the Grover walks are typical models of the quantum walks. We consider the periods and zeta functions of such quantum walks. Moreover, we derive the explicit forms of the absolute zeta functions of corresponding zeta functions. Also, it is shown that our zeta functions of quantum walks are absolute automorphic forms.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Analysis of Yau-Yau Nonlinear Filtering Algorithm: from a Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the beginning of this century, a real time solution of the nonlinear filtering problem without memory was proposed in [1, 2] by the third author and his collaborator, and it is later on referred to as Yau-Yau algorithm. During the last two decades, a great many nonlinear filtering algorithms have been put forward and studied based on this framework. In this paper, we will generalize the results in the original works and conduct a novel convergence analysis of Yau-Yau algorithm from a probabilistic perspective. Instead of considering a particular trajectory, we estimate the expectation of the approximation error, and show that commonly-used statistics of the conditional distribution (such as conditional mean and covariance matrix) can be accurately approximated with arbitrary precision by Yau-Yau algorithm, for general nonlinear filtering systems with very liberal assumptions. This novel probabilistic version of convergence analysis is more compatible with the development of modern stochastic control theory, and will provide a more valuable theoretical guidance for practical implementations of Yau-Yau algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Mixing of the Kawasaki Dynamics on Bounded-Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the worst-case mixing time of the global Kawasaki dynamics for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. Proving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that below the tree uniqueness threshold, the Kawasaki dynamics mix rapidly for all magnetizations. Disproving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that the regime of fast mixing does not extend throughout the regime of tractability for this model: there is a range of parameters for which there exist efficient sampling algorithms for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on max-degree $\Delta$ graphs, but the Kawasaki dynamics can take exponential time to mix. Our techniques involve showing spectral independence in the fixed-magnetization Ising model and proving a sharp threshold for the existence of multiple metastable states in the Ising model with external field on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture on Mesoscopic Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive precise upper bounds for the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals on the critical line, showing for any $\theta\in(-1,0]$, the set of $t\in [T,2T]$ for which $$\max_{|h|\leq \log^\theta T}|\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2}+it+ih)|&gt;\exp\bigg({y+\sqrt{(\log\log T)|\theta|/2}\cdot {S}}\bigg)\frac{(\log T)^{(1+\theta)}}{(\log\log T)^{3/4}}$$ is bounded above by $Cy\exp({-2y-y^2/((1+\theta)\log\log T)})$ (where $S$ is a random variable that is approximately a standard Gaussian as $T$ tends to infinity). This settles a strong form of a conjecture of Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating in mesoscopic intervals which was only known in the leading order. Using similar techniques, we also derive upper bounds for the second moment of the zeta function on such intervals. Conditioning on the value of $S$, we show that for all $t\in[T,2T]$ outside a set of order $o(T)$, $$\frac{1}{\log^\theta T}\int_{|h|\in \log^\theta T} |\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2}+it+ih)|^2\mathrm{d}h \ll e^{2S}\cdot \left(\frac{(\log T)^{(1+\theta)}}{\sqrt{\log\log T}}\right).$$ This proves a weak form of another conjecture of Fyodorov-Keating and generalizes a result of Harper, which is recovered at $\theta = 0$ (in which case $S$ is defined to be zero). Our main tool is an adaptation of the recursive scheme introduced by one of the authors, Bourgade and Radziwi{\l}{\l} to mesoscopic intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of Arcones implies that if a measure-preserving linear operator $S$ on an abstract Wiener space $(X,H,\mu)$ is strongly mixing, then the set of limit points of the random sequence $((2\log n)^{-1/2}S^n(x))_{n\in\mathbb N}$ equals the unit ball of $H$ for a.e. $x \in X$, which may be seen as a generalization of the classical Strassen's law of the iterated logarithm. We extend this result to the case of a continuous parameter $n$ and higher Gaussian chaoses, and we also prove a contraction-type principle for Strassen laws of such chaoses. We then use these extensions to recover or prove Strassen-type laws for a broad collection of processes derived from a Gaussian measure, including "nonlinear" Strassen laws for singular SPDEs such as the KPZ equation.</description>

Abstract: We show that a Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ which is allowed to spend a total of $s &gt; 0$ time units outside a bounded interval does not leave the interval at all. This can be seen as an extreme example of entropic repulsion. Moreover, we explicitly determine the exact asymptotic behaviour of the probability that a Brownian motion on $[0,T]$ spends limited time outside a bounded interval, as $T \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate two ways to renormalize the Brownian loop measure on the Riemann sphere. One by considering the Brownian loop measure on the sphere minus a small disk, known as the normalized Brownian loop measure; the other by taking the measure on simple loops induced by the outer boundary of the Brownian loops, known as Werner's measure. This result allows us to interpret the Loewner energy as an Onsager--Machlup functional for SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure for any fixed $\kappa \in (0, 4]$, and more generally, for any Malliavin--Kontsevich--Suhov loop measure of the same central charge.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic cellular automata with local transition matrices: synchronization, ergodicity, and inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of probabilistic cellular automata that are capable of exhibiting rich dynamics such as synchronization and ergodicity and can be easily inferred from data. The system is a finite-state locally interacting Markov chain on a circular graph. Each site's subsequent state is random, with a distribution determined by its neighborhood's empirical distribution multiplied by a local transition matrix. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions on the local transition matrix for synchronization and ergodicity. Also, we introduce novel least squares estimators for inferring the local transition matrix from various types of data, which may consist of either multiple trajectories, a long trajectory, or ensemble sequences without trajectory information. Under suitable identifiability conditions, we show the asymptotic normality of these estimators and provide non-asymptotic bounds for their accuracy.</description>

Our dynamics can be tuned with a parameter $\beta$, which plays the role of an inverse temperature, and coincides at $\beta$ = $\infty$ with the zero-temperature Ising model with Glauber dynamics, where curves correspond to the boundaries of droplets of one phase immersed in a sea of the other one. We prove that contours typically follow a motion by curvature with an influence of the parameter $\beta$, and establish large deviations bounds at all large enough $\beta$ &lt; $\infty$. The diffusion coefficient and mobility of the model are identified and correspond to those predicted in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer elementary proofs for several results in consecutive pattern containment that were previously demonstrated using ideas from cluster method and analytical combinatorics. Furthermore, we establish new general bounds on the growth rates of consecutive pattern avoidance in permutations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

      <title>Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks, a novel family of architectures that integrates partial stochasticity into the framework of infinitely deep neural networks. Our new class of architectures is designed to improve the limitations of existing architectures around computational efficiency at training and inference time. To do this, we leverage the advantages of partial stochasticity in the infinite-depth limit which include the benefits of full stochasticity e.g. robustness, uncertainty quantification, and memory efficiency, whilst improving their limitations around computational complexity. We present a variety of architectural configurations, offering flexibility in network design including different methods for weight partition. We also provide mathematical guarantees on the expressivity of our models by establishing that our network family qualifies as Universal Conditional Distribution Approximators. Lastly, empirical evaluations across multiple tasks show that our proposed architectures achieve better downstream task performance and uncertainty quantification than their counterparts while being significantly more efficient.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis and Bounds of Generalization Error of Gradient Descent in In-Context Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that transformer-based architectures emulate gradient descent during a forward pass, contributing to in-context learning capabilities - an ability where the model adapts to new tasks based on a sequence of prompt examples without being explicitly trained or fine tuned to do so. This work investigates the generalization properties of a single step of gradient descent in the context of linear regression with well-specified models. A random design setting is considered and analytical expressions are derived for the statistical properties and bounds of generalization error in a non-asymptotic (finite sample) setting. These expressions are notable for avoiding arbitrary constants, and thus offer robust quantitative information and scaling relationships. These results are contrasted with those from classical least squares regression (for which analogous finite sample bounds are also derived), shedding light on systematic and noise components, as well as optimal step sizes. Additionally, identities involving high-order products of Gaussian random matrices are presented as a byproduct of the analysis.</description>
