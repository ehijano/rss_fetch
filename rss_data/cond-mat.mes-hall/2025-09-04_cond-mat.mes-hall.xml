      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall effect with high Chern number in two dimensional ferromagnets Ti2TeSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Chern insulators have emerged as crucial platforms for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and as such have attracted significant interest in spintronics and topological quantum physics due to their unique coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and nontrivial topological characteristics. Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in such systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one edge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic properties. Its majority spin channel possesses only a pair of symmetry-protected Weyl points at the Fermi level, while the states of minority one locate far away from the Fermi level. When spin-orbit coupling is included, a substantial band gap of ~ 92.8 meV is induced at the Weyl points. Remarkably, the emergence of dual dissipationless chiral edge channels and a quantized Hall conductivity plateau at 2e2/h collectively establish monolayer Ti2TeSO as a high-Chern-number insulator with C=2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that valley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of strain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization. The first-principles calculations, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, yield a Curie temperature of 161 K for monolayer Ti2TeSO, thereby indicating the plausibility of coexistence of valley polarization and topological states at elevated temperatures. These findings could provide a foundation for the development of multi-channels dissipationless transport devices and nonvolatile multistate memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast anisotropic exciton transport in phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorene is a two-dimensional (2D) material exhibiting strong in-plane structural anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural anisotropy on the optics, dynamics, and transport of excitons in phosphorene by combining microscopic many-body theory with first principles calculations. Our framework offers a complete and material specific description of the excitonic properties of phosphorene, including exciton states and exciton-phonon interactions, which allow us to quantitatively evaluate the optical absorption spectra, exciton relaxation, and exciton transport, revealing direction-dependent characteristics. Interestingly, we identify the critical role of long-range exchange interactions, which significantly enhance the anisotropy of exciton diffusion, particularly at low temperatures. Our work provides fundamental insights into exciton dynamics in an intrinsically anisotropic 2D material, offering guiding principles for the design of next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.</description>

      <title>Current-induced molecular dissociation: Topological insulators as robust reaction platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in topological materials with symmetry-protected surface states as catalytic platforms has sparked the emerging field of \textit{topocatalysis}. As robust transport is one of the key features of topological insulators, here we explore current-induced molecular dissociation in a transport setup. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological (Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust catalysis in topological materials.</description>

      <title>NeuroQD: A Learning-Based Simulation Framework For Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin qubits in quantum dot devices are promising for scalable quantum computing. However, architectural support is currently hindered by the lack of realistic and performant simulation methods for real devices. Physics-based tools are accurate yet too slow for simulating device behavior in real-time, while qualitative models miss layout and wafer heterostructure. We propose a new simulation approach capable of simulating real devices from the cold-start with real-time performance. Leveraging a key phenomenon observed in physics-based simulation, we train a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the qubit-layer electrostatic potential from gate voltages. Our GPU-accelerated inference delivers &gt;1000x speedup with &gt;96% agreement to the physics-based simulation. Integrated into the experiment control stack, the simulator returns results with millisecond scale latency, reproduces key tuning features, and yields device behaviors and metrics consistent with measurements on devices operated at 9 mK.</description>

      <title>High-$Q$ membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality-factor ($Q$) mechanical resonators are essential components for precise sensing and control of mechanical motion at a quantum level. While amorphous materials such as SiN have been widely used in high-$Q$ mechanical resonators utilizing stress-induced dissipation dilution, crystalline materials have emerging potential to achieve higher quality factors by combining low intrinsic loss and high tensile stress. In this paper, we demonstrate high-Q membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN. Our membrane resonator exhibits a tensile stress exceeding 2.3 GPa and a quality factor of $Q = 8.0 \times 10^6$ at 2.2 K. By estimating the dilution factor, we infer that our TiN resonator has a intrinsic quality factor comparable to that of SiN membrane resonators. With its ultra-high stress and crystalline properties, our TiN films can serve as a powerful tool for opto- and electromechanical systems, offering highly dissipation-diluted mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Deconfined Quantum Critical Point in Quantum Hall Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) represent an unconventional class of quantum criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher paradigm. Nevertheless, both their theoretical identification and experimental realization remain challenging. Here we report compelling evidence of a DQCP in quantum Hall bilayers with half-filled $n=2$ Landau levels in each layer, based on large-scale variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) simulations and exact diagonalization (ED). By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy on Magnetoelastic Waves in Ni/LiNbO3 Hybrid Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnetic anisotropy and crystalline axes in surface acoustic waves (SAWs) driven magnetic resonances of Ni/LiNbO3 hybrid devices. SAW absorption from the interaction with magnons in Ni displays a strong anisotropic dependence on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic field. Magnetic anisotropy is further investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements to show both uniaxial and biaxial anisotropy components in Ni films on LiNbO3. By introducing a dipolar interaction term in addition to the anisotropies, we successfully explain the anisotropic SAW absorption in our devices. These findings show the importance of substrate-induced anisotropy and long-range dipolar effects in SAW-magnons hybrid devices and indicate future directions for optimizing these spin-acoustic devices through comprehensive anisotropy engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relation to recent experimental data [1], we develop a theory framework for demonstrating the feasibility of detecting sharp Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) oscillations in a real time ESR data. The procedure is to follow real time oscillations of the ESR signal measured at a selected frequency of a hyperfine transition. We study a variety of systems such as a single radical molecule with one or two hyperfine coupled nuclei or two molecules that coexist as either radicals or non-radicals, facilitated by charge transfer. We develop a master equation for describing these scenarios and find parameters for which a sharp NMR line can be observed. We show that in all cases an off-diagonal term in the hyperfine tensor is essential for the observation.</description>

      <title>Family of Unconventional Superconductivities in Crystalline Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors exhibit multiple broken symmetries and exceed the range of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. For instance, time-reversal symmetry can be broken in addition to the gauge symmetry, resulting in superconductors that can be enhanced or induced by a magnetic field. However, such unconventional superconductivities are more vulnerable to impurities than their BCS counterparts, requiring highly ordered and clean material systems to observe them. Crystalline rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a promising platform to explore unconventional superconductivity due to its superior material quality and gate-tunable strong correlation effects. Here we report transport measurements of rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene, where a spectrum of superconductivities in a clean limit are observed. Three of them (SC2-4) show highly unusual enhancements by magnetic fields: 1. SC2 is strengthened by an in-plane field; 2. SC3 is boosted by a small out-of-plane field; 3. SC4 is induced by an in-plane field. All these superconductors are robust against an in-plane field up to 8.5 Tesla, exceeding the Pauli limit of conventional superconductors by tens of times and suggesting their unconventional nature. Moreover, we observed that proximitized spin-orbit coupling generates a plethora of new superconductors in the phase diagram, while maintaining the high quality of bare rhombohedral graphene. Our work establishes a family of new superconductors in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which also provides an ideal platform to engineer non-Abelian quasiparticles by proximitizing with quantum anomalous Hall states existing in the same material system.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience of two-dimensional Floquet topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of noise on two-dimensional periodically driven topological phases, focusing on two examples: the anomalous Floquet-Anderson phase and the disordered Floquet-Chern phase. Both phases show an unexpected robustness against timing noise. The noise-induced decay of initially populated topological edge modes occurs in two stages: At short times, thermalization among edge modes leads to exponential decay. This is followed by slow algebraic decay $\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$. The exponent of $1/2$ is characteristic for one-dimensional diffusion, here occurring along the direction perpendicular to the edge. In contrast, localized modes in the bulk exhibit faster decay, $\sim n^{-1}$, corresponding to two-dimensional diffusion. We demonstrate these behaviors through full-scale numerical simulations and support our conclusions using analytical results based upon a phenomenological model. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional Floquet topological phases are ideal candidates for potential applications of Floquet topology, given the unavoidable presence of both quenched disorder and decoherence in experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of non-Hermitian and Hermitian models of Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating altermagnets like MnTe exhibit spin configurations where opposing spins are not only aligned antiparallel but also rotated relative to each other. This is an arrangement reminiscent of antiferromagnetism with a twist of spin canting. This study investigates a model Hamiltonian that captures the essential physics of such systems, incorporating key interactions including Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and conventional exchange terms, relativistic spin-orbit coupling, and d-wave and g-wave orderings. Non-Hermitian dynamics are introduced through complex potentials that simulate energy dissipation and amplification. The paper delves into the behavior of the quantum geometric tensor and the emergence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect within the topologically insulating regime. It also broadens the scope to encompass non-Hermitian metallic altermagnets, focusing on phases characterized by symmetry-breaking d-wave and g-wave order parameters.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thermal Transport in Phase Change Materials-Based Nanocomposites through Interfacial Structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface area. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hill" of solid) and concave ("valley" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer lower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a direct link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat transport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured materials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bloch bands and Weiss oscillations in Dirac mass superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a one-dimensional mass superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field. Using exact solutions for isolated and finite arrays of domain walls, we demonstrate the persistence of Jackiw-Rebbi modes with a field-dependent renormalized velocity. For the periodic case, we adopt a gauge-invariant projection method onto magnetic Bloch states, valid for arbitrary fields and mass profiles, which yields dispersive Landau levels, and confirm its accuracy by comparison with finite arrays spectra. From the miniband spectra we predict modified quantum Hall plateaus and Weiss-like magnetoconductivity oscillations, characterized by a strongly reduced amplitude and a $\pi/2$ phase shift compared to electrostatic superlattices.</description>

Abstract: By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process have stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and checked experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>

      <title>Direct spatiotemporal imaging of a long-lived bulk photovoltaic effect in $BiFeO_{3}$</title>

Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.</description>

      <title>Etching-free dual-lift-off for direct patterning of epitaxial oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although monocrystalline oxide films offer broad functional capabilities, their practical use is hampered by challenges in patterning. Traditional patterning relies on etching, which can be costly and prone to issues like film or substrate damage, under-etching, over-etching, and lateral etching. In this study, we introduce a dual-lift-off method for direct patterning of oxide films, circumventing the etching process and associated issues. Our method involves an initial lift-off of amorphous Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ or Sr$_4$Al$_2$O$_7$ ($a$SAO) through stripping the photoresist, followed by a subsequent lift-off of the functional oxide thin films by dissolving the $a$SAO layer. $a$SAO functions as a ``high-temperature photoresist", making it compatible with the high-temperature growth of monocrystalline oxides. Using this method, patterned ferromagnetic La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ and ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$ were fabricated, accurately mirroring the shape of the photoresist. Our study presents a straightforward, flexible, precise, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective method for patterning high-quality oxide thin films.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\textit{Ans\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.</description>

      <title>Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system.</description>

      <title>Octupole-driven spin-transfer torque switching of all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials, since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment, which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect, which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of 363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10 MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ, and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal transport along the edge of a small chiral-spin-liquid device coupled to two Ising-chain reservoirs, a platform suitable for quantum-engineered systems. Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-B\"uttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stationary spectrum of individual dipole emitters in plasmonic nanocavities has been studied for a range of cavity geometries and dipole configurations. Less is known about the coherent dynamics of single photon creation in the nanocavity near field by an excited dipole. We address this gap by developing a Lorentzian kernel approximation that solves the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation that describes the coupled dipole-photon dynamics in the single-excitation manifold. Our approach encodes the broadband nature of the nanocavity field through a non-Markovian memory kernel, derived from macroscopic QED theory. For a two-level dipole near a metallic nanosphere, we show that the single photon probability density in frequency space evolves in strong coupling from an initially localized source at the qubit frequency into a Rabi doublet over a timescale governed by the kernel spectrum. This dynamical crossover is accompanied by the formation of single-photon interference patterns in frequency and time, propagating coherently over a timescale limited by the shape of kernel spectrum to $\sim 100-150$ fs, which is accessible to ultrafast spectroscopy. We also show that the stationary spectrum of the coupled system can be manipulated by driving the nanocavity field using coherent pulses with variable spectral bandwidth. Using single-photon pulses narrower than the kernel spectrum, the Rabi splitting in a system that supports strong coupling can be effectively removed. The applicability of our results to other dipole-nanocavity configurations is discussed and a general strong coupling criterion for nanocavities is formulated.</description>

      <title>Signatures of emergent surface states across a displacive topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions involving crystalline symmetry breaking provide a fertile ground to explore the interplay between symmetry, topology, and emergent quantum phenomena. Recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional topological material, Bi$_4$I$_4$, has been predicted to host topologically non-trivial gapless surfaces at high temperature, which undergo a finite temperature phase transition to a low temperature gapped phase. Here we present experimental signatures of this room temperature phase transition from a high-temperature $\beta$-phase with a surface state to a gapped $\alpha$-phase hosting hinge states. Using real-space current mapping and resistance fluctuation spectroscopy, we identify signatures of a displacive topological phase transition mediated by a first-order thermodynamic structural change. Near the emergence of $\beta$-phase, we observe pronounced telegraphic noise, indicating fluctuating phase domains with topological surface states. The spatially resolved current map reveals electron transport via the gapless surface states in the $\beta$-phase, which vanishes upon transitioning to the $\alpha$-phase with localized conduction channels (or hinge modes). Our experimental results, supported by first principles estimates and effective theory of a topological displacive phase transition, establish Bi$_4$I$_4$ as a candidate material showing intricate interplay of classical thermodynamic phase transitions with topological quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Keldysh field theory approach to direct electric and thermoelectric currents in quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of a quantum dot contacted to two superconducting reservoirs by means of the Keldysh field theory approach, showing how this technique allows us to straightforwardly recover previous results, resulting extremely effective in dealing with quantum transport problems. In particular, we determine the direct current occurring at equilibrium and the electric and thermoelectric currents triggered when the system is driven out of equilibrium by a voltage or a temperature bias, also for a normal-quantum dot-superconductor junction. The main result of the work is the derivation of the full expression for the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, provided that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements for which we suggest suitable materials, most promisingly the material group $X$Mo$_3$S$_3$ ($X$ = Rb, K, Cs).</description>

      <title>Unexpected collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</description>

      <title>High frequency permeability of the composite with ferromagnetic spherical shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies high-frequency permeability of the composite materials consisting of hollow ferromagnetic particles embedded into the non-magnetic media. We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shells: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\ll D$ to $d\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plane outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. We consider two types of magnetic anisotropy, which help to stabilize such a magnetic configuration: the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and the ``circular'' uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis rotated together with the magnetization direction outside the vortex core. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. We showed that for $d\sim D$ the composite's permeability behaves in similar manner for both types of magnetic anisotropy. It was shown also that for the second type of magnetic anisotropy and in the limit $d/D\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous for both types of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings in different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moir\'e Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\'e band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moir\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\'e superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In non-interacting systems, disorder can drive a trivial phase into a topological one. However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional line-gapped non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic modulation strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. We further examine the parameter space to determine the specific regimes that give rise to RL. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching of the N\'{e}el Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: N\'{e}el vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of N\'{e}el vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\'{e}el vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to N\'{e}el vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\'{e}el vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement high-resolution ($&lt;1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Moreover, we identify robust differences between our data and DFT calculations that hint at the modification of the infrared molecular response by the nanocavity environment. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational spectroscopy at the chip level.</description>

Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>
