      <title>Unified Network-Based Representation of BIM Models for Embedding Semantic, Spatial, and Topological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building structures throughout their lifecycle. However, existing research lacks effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological relationships between components in BIM models, which are essential for understanding design patterns and enhancing decision-making. This study proposes a unified network-based representation method that integrates the "semantic-spatial-topological" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models. By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation and learning of design patterns.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis of PINNs: Variants, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been emerging as a powerful computational tool for solving differential equations. However, the applicability of these models is still in its initial stages and requires more standardization to gain wider popularity. Through this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of PINNs approaches exploring various aspects related to their architecture, variants, areas of application, real-world use cases, challenges, and so on. Even though existing surveys can be identified, they fail to provide a comprehensive view as they primarily focus on either different application scenarios or limit their study to a superficial level. This survey attempts to bridge the gap in the existing literature by presenting a detailed analysis of all these factors combined with recent advancements and state-of-the-art research in PINNs. Additionally, we discuss prevalent challenges in PINNs implementation and present some of the future research directions as well. The overall contributions of the survey can be summarised into three sections: A detailed overview of PINNs architecture and variants, a performance analysis of PINNs on different equations and application domains highlighting their features. Finally, we present a detailed discussion of current issues and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Evolution analysis of software quality metrics in an open-source java project: A case study on TestNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software quality is critical in modern software engineering, especially in large and evolving codebases. This study analyzes the evolution of software quality metrics in five successive versions of the open-source Java testing framework TestNG. Using the static analysis tool Understand, eleven key object-oriented metrics, including cyclomatic complexity, class coupling, and lines of code, were extracted for each version. Statistical and visual analyses reveal structural trends over time. The results indicate that TestNG has matured into a more stable and maintainable framework, reflecting ongoing development, refactoring, and architectural improvements. This study provides insights into design evolution and offers recommendations for maintaining code quality in similar projects.</description>

      <title>Be.FM: Open Foundation Models for Human Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their success in numerous fields, the potential of foundation models for modeling and understanding human behavior remains largely unexplored. We introduce Be.FM, one of the first open foundation models designed for human behavior modeling. Built upon open-source large language models and fine-tuned on a diverse range of behavioral data, Be.FM can be used to understand and predict human decision-making. We construct a comprehensive set of benchmark tasks for testing the capabilities of behavioral foundation models. Our results demonstrate that Be.FM can predict behaviors, infer characteristics of individuals and populations, generate insights about contexts, and apply behavioral science knowledge.</description>

      <title>Hybrid subgradient and simulated annealing method for hemivariational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a global aggregate subgradient method for the numerical solution of hemivariational inequality problems arising in contact mechanics. The method integrates a global search procedure to identify starting points for a local minimization algorithm. The algorithm consists of two types of steps: null steps and serious steps. In each null step, only two subgradients are utilized: the aggregate subgradient and the subgradient computed at the current iteration point, which together determine the search direction. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the proposed method with selected solvers using a representative contact mechanics problem as a case study.</description>

      <title>Computerized Modeling of Electrophysiology and Pathoelectrophysiology of the Atria -- How Much Detail is Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review focuses on the computerized modeling of the electrophysiology of the human atria, emphasizing the simulation of common arrhythmias such as atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Which components of the model are necessary to accurately model arrhythmogenic tissue modifications, including remodeling, cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis, to ensure reliable simulations? The central question explored is the level of detail required for trustworthy simulations for a specific context of use. The review discusses the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting the risks of oversimplification and excessive detail. It covers various aspects of atrial modeling, from cellular to whole atria levels, including the influence of atrial geometry, fiber direction, anisotropy, and wall thickness on simulation outcomes. The article also examines the impact of different modeling approaches, such as volumetric 3D models, bilayer models, and single surface models, on the realism of simulations. In addition, it reviews the latest advances in the modeling of fibrotic tissue and the verification and validation of atrial models. The intended use of these models in planning and optimization of atrial ablation strategies is discussed, with a focus on personalized modeling for individual patients and cohort-based approaches for broader applications. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating experimental data and clinical validation to enhance the utility of computerized atrial models to improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>A blockchain-based intelligent recommender system framework for enhancing supply chain resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposed a data-driven supply chain disruption response baseline framework based on intelligent recommender system technology as an initial SCRes reactive solution. To improve the data quality and reliability of the proposed IRS as a stable, secure, and resilient decision support system, blockchain technology is integrated into the baseline architecture. The smart contract is prototyped to demonstrate the information exchange mechanism under a BLC network environment. The BLC-IRS framework is then implemented with an industrial case to demonstrate its executable function. A system dynamics (SD) simulation model is adopted to validate the BLC-IRS framework as an effective digital SCRes enhancement measure. The simulation results indicated that the proposed BLC-IRS framework can be effectively implemented as a SC disruption mitigation measure in the SCRes response phase as reactive measure, enabling SC participants to react better to SC disruptions at the physical level. Compared to previous studies that limited at the conceptual level as the proactive SCRes measure with a standalone fashion, the developed BLC-IRS contributes an executable SCRes digital solution with synthetic technologies as a reactive SCRes measure for the SCRes community, by identifying the internal and external supplementary resource information in an agile, safe, and real-time manner after SC disruption.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Aided Approach for Estimating Field Permeability Map by Fusing Well Logs, Well Tests, and Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining reliable permeability maps of oil reservoirs is crucial for building a robust and accurate reservoir simulation model and, therefore, designing effective recovery strategies. This problem, however, remains challenging, as it requires the integration of various data sources by experts from different disciplines. Moreover, there are no sources to provide direct information about the inter-well space. In this work, a new method based on the data-fusion approach is proposed for predicting two-dimensional permeability maps on the whole reservoir area. This method utilizes non-parametric regression with a custom kernel shape accounting for different data sources: well logs, well tests, and seismics. A convolutional neural network is developed to process seismic data and then incorporate it with other sources. A multi-stage data fusion procedure helps to artificially increase the training dataset for the seismic interpretation model and finally to construct the adequate permeability map. The proposed methodology of permeability map construction from different sources was tested on a real oil reservoir located in Western Siberia. The results demonstrate that the developed map perfectly corresponds to the permeability estimations in the wells, and the inter-well space permeability predictions are considerably improved through the incorporation of the seismic data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Perishable and Non-Perishable Product Assignment to Packaging Lines in a Sustainable Manufacturing System: An AUGMECON2VIKOR Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying appropriate manufacturing systems for products can be considered a pivotal manufacturing task contributing to the optimization of operational and planning activities. It has gained importance in the food industry due to the distinct constraints and considerations posed by perishable and non-perishable items in this problem. Hence, this study proposes a new mathematical model according to knowledge discovery as well as an assignment model to optimize manufacturing systems for perishable, non-perishable, and hybrid products tailored to meet their unique characteristics. In the presented model, three objective functions are taken into account: (1) minimizing production costs by assigning the products to the right set of manufacturing systems, (2) maximizing the product quality by assigning the products to the systems, and (3) minimizing total CO2 emissions of the machines. A numerical example is utilized to evaluate the performance of AUGMECON2VIKOR compared to AUGMECON2. The results show that AUGMECON2VIKOR obtains superior Pareto solutions across all objective functions. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis explores the positive green impacts, influencing both cost and quality.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Representation Learning for fMRI-based Neurological Disorder Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive advances achieved using deep learning for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in tasks such as identifying neurological disorders. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks.

      <title>SVRPBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse, constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups. Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.</description>
