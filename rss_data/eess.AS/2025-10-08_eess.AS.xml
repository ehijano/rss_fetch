      <title>WaveSP-Net: Learnable Wavelet-Domain Sparse Prompt Tuning for Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at https://github.com/xxuan-acoustics/WaveSP-Net.</description>

      <title>AQA-TTRL: Self-Adaptation in Audio Question Answering with Test-Time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive general audio understanding, but once deployed, they are static and fail to improve with new real-world audio data. As traditional supervised fine-tuning is costly, we introduce a novel framework for test-time audio understanding, AQA-TTRL, where an LALM evolves on-the-fly using only unlabeled test data. It first generates pseudo-labels from the prediction via majority voting, then optimizes the model via reinforcement learning. To handle the inherent noise in these self-generated labels, we introduce a confidence-based weighting method to adjust training signals. Furthermore, a multiple-attempt sampling operation mitigates advantage collapse and stabilizes training. On the MMAU (test-mini/test), MMAR, and MMSU benchmarks, AQA-TTRL achieves significant average improvements of 4.42% for the Qwen2.5-Omni 7B model and 11.04% for the 3B model. Notably, the adapted 3B model consistently outperforms the direct inference of the unadapted 7B model, highlighting the effectiveness of previously unexplored test-time adaptations in audio understanding.</description>

      <title>Teaching Machines to Speak Using Articulatory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speech production systems predominantly rely on large transformer models that operate as black boxes, providing little interpretability or grounding in the physical mechanisms of human speech. We address this limitation by proposing a new framework: speech generation through explicit articulatory control. This reframes speech as a motor control task similar to robotic manipulation. Our approach uses reinforcement learning to train a policy that directly controls the movements of vocal tract articulators, such as the tongue, lips, and jaw, to produce syllable-level speech. Specifically, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to learn optimal articulatory movements based on acoustic feedback provided by our audio perceiver, Sylber. The resulting articulatory trajectories are decoded into audio using SPARC, a pre-trained articulatory-to-speech decoder. We train this framework on six target syllables, and it demonstrates successful convergence, with similarity scores between the policy-generated audio and the target syllables exceeding 0.85. Accurate human transcription of the audio for syllables such as "please", "loot", and "cat" demonstrates the intelligibility of this framework.</description>

      <title>Investigation of perception inconsistency in speaker embedding for asynchronous voice anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the speech generation framework that represents the speaker attribute with an embedding vector, asynchronous voice anonymization can be achieved by modifying the speaker embedding derived from the original speech. However, the inconsistency between machine and human perceptions of the speaker attribute within the speaker embedding remains unexplored, limiting its performance in asynchronous voice anonymization. To this end, this study investigates this inconsistency via modifications to speaker embedding in the speech generation process. Experiments conducted on the FACodec and Diff-HierVC speech generation models discover a subspace whose removal alters machine perception while preserving its human perception of the speaker attribute in the generated speech. With these findings, an asynchronous voice anonymization is developed, achieving 100% human perception preservation rate while obscuring the machine perception. Audio samples can be found in https://voiceprivacy.github.io/speaker-embedding-eigen-decomposition/.</description>

      <title>Neural Forward Filtering for Speaker-Image Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address monaural multi-speaker-image separation in reverberant conditions, aiming at separating mixed speakers but preserving the reverberation of each speaker. A straightforward approach for this task is to directly train end-to-end DNN systems to predict the reverberant speech of each speaker based on the input mixture. Although effective, this approach does not explicitly exploit the physical constraint that reverberant speech can be reproduced by convolving the direct-path signal with a linear filter. To address this, we propose CxNet, a two-DNN system with a neural forward filtering module in between. The first DNN is trained to jointly predict the direct-path signal and reverberant speech. Based on the direct-path estimate, the neural forward filtering module estimates the linear filter, and the estimated filter is then convolved with the direct-path estimate to obtain another estimate of reverberant speech, which is utilized as a discriminative feature to help the second DNN better estimate the reverberant speech. By explicitly modeling the linear filter, CxNet could leverage the physical constraint between the direct-path signal and reverberant speech to capture crucial information about reverberation tails. Evaluation results on the SMS-WSJ dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting MFCCs: Evidence for Spectral-Prosodic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are an important feature in speech processing. A deeper understanding of their properties can contribute to the work that is being done with both classical and deep learning models. This study challenges the long-held assumption that MFCCs lack relevant temporal information by investigating their relationship with speech prosody. Using a null hypothesis significance testing framework, a systematic assessment is made about the statistical independence between MFCCs and the three prosodic features: energy, fundamental frequency (F0), and voicing. The results demonstrate that it is statistically implausible that the MFCCs are independent of any of these three prosodic features. This finding suggests that MFCCs inherently carry valuable prosodic information, which can inform the design of future models in speech analysis and recognition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Modeling and Evaluation Approaches in Speech Emotion Recognition: Considering Subjectivity of Annotators and Ambiguity of Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, speech emotion recognition (SER) has received growing attention. To train SER systems, researchers collect emotional speech databases annotated by crowdsourced or in-house raters who select emotions from predefined categories. However, disagreements among raters are common. Conventional methods treat these disagreements as noise, aggregating labels into a single consensus target. While this simplifies SER as a single-label task, it ignores the inherent subjectivity of human emotion perception. This dissertation challenges such assumptions and asks: (1) Should minority emotional ratings be discarded? (2) Should SER systems learn from only a few individuals' perceptions? (3) Should SER systems predict only one emotion per sample?
  Psychological studies show that emotion perception is subjective and ambiguous, with overlapping emotional boundaries. We propose new modeling and evaluation perspectives: (1) Retain all emotional ratings and represent them with soft-label distributions. Models trained on individual annotator ratings and jointly optimized with standard SER systems improve performance on consensus-labeled tests. (2) Redefine SER evaluation by including all emotional data and allowing co-occurring emotions (e.g., sad and angry). We propose an ``all-inclusive rule'' that aggregates all ratings to maximize diversity in label representation. Experiments on four English emotion databases show superior performance over majority and plurality labeling. (3) Construct a penalization matrix to discourage unlikely emotion combinations during training. Integrating it into loss functions further improves performance. Overall, embracing minority ratings, multiple annotators, and multi-emotion predictions yields more robust and human-aligned SER systems.</description>

      <title>TokenChain: A Discrete Speech Chain via Semantic Token Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by 31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains effective with token interfaces and models.</description>

      <title>Advancing Automated Spatio-Semantic Analysis in Picture Description Using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units (CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24% sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models open-sourced to public.</description>

      <title>Sci-Phi: A Large Language Model Spatial Audio Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition, single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content, location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources. Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo</description>

      <title>Transcribing Rhythmic Patterns of the Guitar Track in Polyphonic Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas chord transcription has received considerable attention during the past couple of decades, far less work has been devoted to transcribing and encoding the rhythmic patterns that occur in a song. The topic is especially relevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played by strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many cases one cannot objectively define a single "right" rhythmic pattern for a given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels, we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic patterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate stem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture. Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature markers. We perform ablation studies and error analysis and propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and readability of the predicted rhythmic pattern sequence.</description>

      <title>StereoSync: Spatially-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years, video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier. To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.</description>

      <title>FoleyGRAM: Video-to-Audio Generation with GRAM-Aligned Multimodal Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.</description>

      <title>Segment-Factorized Full-Song Generation on Symbolic Piano Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Segmented Full-Song Model (SFS) for symbolic full-song generation. The model accepts a user-provided song structure and an optional short seed segment that anchors the main idea around which the song is developed. By factorizing a song into segments and generating each one through selective attention to related segments, the model achieves higher quality and efficiency compared to prior work. To demonstrate its suitability for human-AI interaction, we further wrap SFS into a web application that enables users to iteratively co-create music on a piano roll with customizable structures and flexible ordering.</description>

      <title>ECTSpeech: Enhancing Efficient Speech Synthesis via Easy Consistency Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05984</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation. However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially reducing the model's training cost and complexity.</description>

      <title>Latent Speech-Text Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Modulation Discovery with Differentiable Digital Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulations are a critical part of sound design and music production, enabling the creation of complex and evolving audio. Modern synthesizers provide envelopes, low frequency oscillators (LFOs), and more parameter automation tools that allow users to modulate the output with ease. However, determining the modulation signals used to create a sound is difficult, and existing sound-matching / parameter estimation systems are often uninterpretable black boxes or predict high-dimensional framewise parameter values without considering the shape, structure, and routing of the underlying modulation curves. We propose a neural sound-matching approach that leverages modulation extraction, constrained control signal parameterizations, and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) to discover the modulations present in a sound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on highly modulated synthetic and real audio samples, its applicability to different DDSP synth architectures, and investigate the trade-off it incurs between interpretability and sound-matching accuracy. We make our code and audio samples available and provide the trained DDSP synths in a VST plugin.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Dataset Integration Strategies for Robust Audio Deepfake Detection: A SAFE Challenge System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SAFE Challenge evaluates synthetic speech detection across three tasks: unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised learning (SSL) front-ends, training data compositions, and audio length configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a multilingual dataset of 256,600 samples spanning 9 languages and over 70 TTS systems from CodecFake, MLAAD v5, SpoofCeleb, Famous Figures, and MAILABS. Through extensive experimentation with different SSL front-ends, three training data versions, and two audio lengths, we achieved second place in both Task 1 (unmodified audio detection) and Task 3 (laundered audio detection), demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CL-UZH team submitted one system each for the fixed and open conditions of the NIST SRE 2024 challenge. For the closed-set condition, results for the audio-only trials were achieved using the X-vector system developed with Kaldi. For the audio-visual results we used only models developed for the visual modality. Two sets of results were submitted for the open-set and closed-set conditions, one based on a pretrained model using the VoxBlink2 and VoxCeleb2 datasets. An Xvector-based model was trained from scratch using the CTS superset dataset for the closed set. In addition to the submission of the results of the SRE24 evaluation to the competition website, we talked about the performance of the proposed systems on the SRE24 evaluation in this report.</description>

      <title>MuFFIN: Multifaceted Pronunciation Feedback Model with Interactive Hierarchical Neural Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) manages to facilitate second-language (L2) learners to practice pronunciation skills by offering timely and instructive feedback. To examine pronunciation proficiency from multiple facets, existing methods for CAPT broadly fall into two categories: mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as well as automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). The former aims to pinpoint phonetic pronunciation errors and provide diagnostic feedback, while the latter seeks instead to quantify pronunciation proficiency pertaining to various aspects. Despite the natural complementarity between MDD and APA, researchers and practitioners, however, often treat them as independent tasks with disparate modeling paradigms. In light of this, we in this paper first introduce MuFFIN, a Multi-Faceted pronunciation Feedback model with an Interactive hierarchical Neural architecture, to jointly address the tasks of MDD and APA. To better capture the nuanced distinctions between phonemes in the feature space, a novel phoneme-contrastive ordinal regularization mechanism is then put forward to optimize the proposed model to generate more phoneme-discriminative features while factoring in the ordinality of the aspect scores. In addition, to address the intricate data imbalance problem in MDD, we design a simple yet effective training objective, which is specifically tailored to perturb the outputs of a phoneme classifier with the phoneme-specific variations, so as to better render the distribution of predicted phonemes meanwhile considering their mispronunciation characteristics. A series of experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our method in relation to several cutting-edge baselines, showing state-of-the-art performance on both the APA and MDD tasks.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Incorporating Mamba for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to investigate the use of a recently proposed, attention-free, scalable state-space model (SSM), Mamba, for the speech enhancement (SE) task. In particular, we employ Mamba to deploy different regression-based SE models (SEMamba) with different configurations, namely basic, advanced, causal, and non-causal. Furthermore, loss functions either based on signal-level distances or metric-oriented are considered. Experimental evidence shows that SEMamba attains a competitive PESQ of 3.55 on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset with the advanced, non-causal configuration. A new state-of-the-art PESQ of 3.69 is also reported when SEMamba is combined with Perceptual Contrast Stretching (PCS). Compared against Transformed-based equivalent SE solutions, a noticeable FLOPs reduction up to ~12% is observed with the advanced non-causal configurations. Finally, SEMamba can be used as a pre-processing step before automatic speech recognition (ASR), showing competitive performance against recent SE solutions.</description>

      <title>Combining Deterministic Enhanced Conditions with Dual-Streaming Encoding for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) models need to incorporate correct prior knowledge as reliable conditions to generate accurate predictions. However, providing reliable conditions using noisy features is challenging. One solution is to use features enhanced by deterministic methods as conditions. However, the information distortion and loss caused by deterministic methods might affect the diffusion process. In this paper, we first investigate the effects of using different deterministic SE models as conditions for diffusion. We validate two conditions depending on whether the noisy feature was used as part of the condition: one using only the deterministic feature (deterministic-only), and the other using both deterministic and noisy features (deterministic-noisy). Preliminary investigation found that using deterministic enhanced conditions improves hearing experiences on real data, while the choice between using deterministic-only or deterministic-noisy conditions depends on the deterministic models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual-streaming encoding Repair-Diffusion Model for SE (DERDM-SE) to more effectively utilize both conditions. Moreover, we found that fine-grained deterministic models have greater potential in objective evaluation metrics, while UNet-based deterministic models provide more stable diffusion performance. Therefore, in the DERDM-SE, we propose a deterministic model that combines coarse- and fine-grained processing. Experimental results on CHiME4 show that the proposed models effectively leverage deterministic models to achieve better SE evaluation scores, along with more stable performance compared to other diffusion-based SE models.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Training Data Attribution for Music Generative Models via Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of unlearning methods for training data attribution (TDA) in music generative models trained on large-scale datasets. TDA aims to identify which specific training data points contributed the most to the generation of a particular output from a specific model. This is crucial in the context of AI-generated music, where proper recognition and credit for original artists are generally overlooked. By enabling white-box attribution, our work supports a fairer system for acknowledging artistic contributions and addresses pressing concerns related to AI ethics and copyright. We apply unlearning-based attribution to a text-to-music diffusion model trained on a large-scale dataset and investigate its feasibility and behavior in this setting. To validate the method, we perform a grid search over different hyperparameter configurations and quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the unlearning approach. We then compare attribution patterns from unlearning with non-counterfactual approaches. Our findings suggest that unlearning-based approaches can be effectively adapted to music generative models, introducing large-scale TDA to this domain and paving the way for more ethical and accountable AI systems for music creation.</description>

      <title>Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a step-by-step video-to-audio (V2A) generation method for finer controllability over the generation process and more realistic audio synthesis. Inspired by traditional Foley workflows, our approach aims to comprehensively capture all sound events induced by a video through the incremental generation of missing sound events. To avoid the need for costly multi-reference video-audio datasets, each generation step is formulated as a negatively guided V2A process that discourages duplication of existing sounds. The guidance model is trained by finetuning a pre-trained V2A model on audio pairs from adjacent segments of the same video, allowing training with standard single-reference audiovisual datasets that are easily accessible. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances the separability of generated sounds at each step and improves the overall quality of the final composite audio, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach. We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection, reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering Transformer: A Training-Free Transformer Architecture for Heart Murmur Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an attempt to address the need for skilled clinicians in heart sound interpretation, recent research efforts on automating cardiac auscultation have explored deep learning approaches. The majority of these approaches have been based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697, demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic speech generated by advanced text-to-speech (TTS) models, coupled with post-processing and laundering techniques, presents a significant challenge for audio forensic detection. In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.
