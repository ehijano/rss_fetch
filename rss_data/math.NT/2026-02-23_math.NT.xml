      <title>The Golden Sieve and its connections to Hiccup sequences and Fraenkel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The golden sieve, a self-referential deletion process on increasing sequences of positive integers, was introduced by the author in 2002 (OEIS A099267). At each step, a pointer read from the working sequence designates which element to remove. Applied to the natural numbers, the sieve is governed by the golden ratio and recovers the Wythoff partition. We develop the theory of the golden sieve on arithmetic progressions and reveal new structural properties. The survivor sequence is a hiccup sequence in the sense of Fokkink and Joshi, whose gaps take exactly two consecutive values, selected by a rule that depends on the sequence itself. The resulting partition satisfies a Fraenkel-type complementary equation, and the gap word is Sturmian in the base case. A double sieve variant, where both pointer and target are removed at each step, yields three-way partitions of the integers. On perfect squares, the hiccup rule becomes doubly self-referential: the gap at step $n$ is controlled by whether $n$ is the square of a survivor index, so the sequence governs its own gaps through its squared values. A bootstrap argument yields the precise asymptotic growth of the survivors. We also introduce the extraction sieve $\mathcal{C}_{j,y,z}$, a family of processes that repeatedly extract and delete elements from the bottom of an infinite sequence. On $\mathbb{N}$, this sieve produces the $(j,1,y,z)$-hiccup sequence of Fokkink--Joshi, tautologically. Thus the ``silver sieve'' $\mathcal{C}_{1,3,2}$ on $\mathbb{N}$ is simply the Bosma--Dekking--Steiner $(1,1,3,2)$-hiccup with slope $1+\sqrt{2}$. On arithmetic progressions $a\mathbb{N}+b$, the sieve produces the new $(j,\,a{+}b,\,ay,\,az)$-hiccup via an affine action on parameter space, providing an algebraic bridge between sieves and hiccup sequences.</description>

      <title>Product of powers of distinct primes as sums of Fibonacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the $n$-th Fibonacci number. In this paper, we study the Diophantine equation $F_n+F_m=p^xq^y$ in nonnegative integers $n\ge m$, $x$ and $y$, where $p$ and $q$ are fixed distinct prime numbers. We determine all pairs of primes $(q,p)$ with $q\le \min\{1000,p\}$ such that the above equation has at least two solutions $(x,y)$ (and corresponding $m,n$) in positive integers.</description>

      <title>A function field analogue of Ligozat's theorem for Drinfeld modular units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a nonzero level $\mathfrak{n} \in \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. In this paper, we first establish a function field analogue of Ligozat's theorem, which serves as our main result and provides a criterion for Drinfeld modular units on the Drinfeld modular curve $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We further conjecture that this criterion characterizes all Drinfeld modular units; we verify the conjecture in the cases of prime power level and of level equal to the product of two primes.
  Second, as an application of Drinfeld modular units, we investigate the rational cuspidal divisor class group $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ of $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We construct an injective map $g$ from the group of degree $0$ rational cuspidal divisors on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ to the group of Drinfeld modular units on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ tensored with $\mathbb{Q}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. As a result, we establish an explicit upper bound for the exponent of $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ for general level $\mathfrak{n}$.</description>

      <title>Modules of Jacobi forms of degree two of small levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe explicitly the modules of (Siegel-)Jacobi forms of degree two of index one of any scalar valued weight with respect to some congruence subgroups of small levels $N\leq 4$. Such a structure for the full Siegel modular group as a module over scalar valued Siegel modular forms of even weight has been explicitly given by T.~Ibukiyama. There we used an explicit structure theorem of rings of scalar valued Siegel modular forms by Igusa and that of vector valued Siegel modular forms of weight $\det^k\, \Sym^2$ by T. Satoh and T. Ibukiyama. On the other hand, for levels $N=2$, $3$, $4$, ring structures of scalar valued case
  have been also known by H. Aoki and T. Ibukiyama and $\det^k \Sym^2$-valued case by H. Aoki.
  In this paper, by merging these results, we give the same sort of simple structure theorems on modules of Jacobi forms of degree of two of index one for level $2$, $3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>A new class of Correlations insisting on Ramanujan expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying Correlations with Ramanujan Expansions, we arrive to present the new class of, say, Two-Seasons Correlations, abbr. T-S, as a natural set expressing some of the features of, say, H-L-like Correlations; these are the ones that mimic the H-L ($=$Hardy-Littlewood) Correlation with shift $2k$, needed to study $2k-$twin primes following Hardy \&amp; Littlewood Conjecture. After introducing the $3-$Hypotheses Correlations in a previous paper, we add two other, very natural, hypotheses: the fifth is a technical one, simplifying calculations; but the fourth is called 'Parity', since it deals with the parity of natural numbers we play with. In particular, we may build (devoting to this 'our mainstream', here) a single Correlation that satisfies these '5 Axioms', thus a T-S one, that 'entangles two different Correlations' (whence Two-Seasons: T-S) depending on $a$ ($=$ the shift) parity. For $a$ even, our 'Artifact' mimics the H-L Correlation, in fact $a=2k$; but, while H-L Correlation is 'negligible', say, on $a$ odd, our Artifact seems to compare at least in the order of magnitude to H-L Correlation on $a$ even, being linked to another additive problem. Namely, on $a$ even, the Artifact 'counts', say, classic solutions to: $p_1+a=p_2$, in odd primes $p_1,p_2$; while, on $a$ odd, it 'counts' solutions to: $p_1+a=2^j p_2$, again with odd primes $p_1,p_2$ and with $j\in \N$ (satisfying the natural arithmetic constraints). More in general, our T-S Correlations 'entangle' two different Diophantine equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical GCD Problems and a Variant of the Dynamical Mordell-Lang Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \cite{NZ25} and \cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis.
  In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting.
  Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Large Galois orbits conjectures for points of unlikely intersections of curves in $Y(1)^n$, upon assumptions on the intersection of such curves with the boundary $X(1)^n\backslash Y(1)^n$, in the Zilber-Pink setting. As a corollary, building on work of Habegger-Pila and Daw-Orr, we obtain new cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture for curves in $Y(1)^n$.</description>
