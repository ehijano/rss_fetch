      <title>Is animal magnetoreception quantum? A perspective from the energy resolution limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, $\hbar$. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to $\hbar$, the more \enquote{quantum} is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: A Novel Tool for Assessing Daily Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement Integrating Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elevated stress negatively impacts health, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, weak immunity, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Current lab-based methods lack real-time stress measurement, while saliva diagnostics offers a convenient and non-invasive alternative. This work proposes repurposing dental floss as a thread-analytical saliva diagnostic device. This method uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. By integrating an electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer specific to cortisol (cort-eMIP) on a porous-laser-engraved-graphene (PLEG) working electrode, the saliva-floss platform shows a detection range of 0.10-10000 pg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9916) with a detection limit of 0.023 pg mL-1 for cortisol (in buffer medium). The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 5 minutes. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64 to 102.4 percent recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision. Validated using human saliva samples in a stress study, it showed a high correlation (r= 0.9910) with conventional ELISA assays. Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels and can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Inferring biological processes with intrinsic noise from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of soft-body rolling motion without external torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drosophila larva, a soft-body animal, can bend its body and roll efficiently to escape danger. However, contrary to common belief, this rolling motion is not driven by the imbalance of gravity and ground reaction forces. Through functional imaging and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the sequential actuation of axial muscles within an appropriate range of angles is critical for generating rolling. We model the interplay between muscle contraction, hydrostatic skeleton deformation, and body-environment interactions, and systematically explain how sequential muscle actuation generates the rolling motion. Additionally, we constructed a pneumatic soft robot to mimic the larval rolling strategy, successfully validating our model. This mechanics model of soft-body rolling motion not only advances the study of related neural circuits, but also holds potential for applications in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>

      <title>Cell Sorting in an Active Nematic Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mixture of extensile and contractile cells using a vertex model extended to include active nematic stresses. The two cell populations phase separate over time. While phase separation strengthens monotonically with an increasing magnitude of contractile activity, the dependence on extensile activity is non-monotonic, so that sufficiently high values reduce the extent of sorting. We interpret this by showing that extensile activity renders the system motile, enabling cells to undergo neighbour exchanges. Contractile cells that come into contact as a result are then more likely to stay connected due to an effective attraction arising from contractile activity.</description>
