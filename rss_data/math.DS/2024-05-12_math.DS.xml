      <title>Amenable actions of real and $p$-adic algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a locally compact field of characteristic 0. Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over $K$, acting algebraically on an algebraic variety $V$. We prove that the action of $G(K)$ (the group of $K$-rational points of $G$) on $V(K)$ is topologically amenable, if and only if all points stabilizers in $G(K)$ are solvable-by-compact. This follows by combining a result by Borel-Serre \cite{BoSe} with the following fact: let $G$ be a second countable locally compact group acting continuously on a second countable locally compact space $Y$. If the action $G\curvearrowright Y$ is smooth (i.e. the Borel structure on $G\backslash Y$ is countably separated), then topological amenability of $G\curvearrowright Y$ is equivalent to amenability of all point stabilizers in $G$.</description>

      <title>A classification of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms via geometric Markov partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue with the ideas of Bonatti-Langevin-Jeandenans towards a constructive and algorithmic classification of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms (possibly with spines), up to topological conjugacy. We begin by indicating how to assign to every pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism an abstract geometric type through a Markov partition whose rectangles have been endowed with a vertical direction; these are known as geometric Markov partitions. Such assignment is not unique, as it depends on the specific geometric Markov partition, and not every abstract geometric type is realized by a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. This poses interesting problems related to the algorithmic computability of the classification. The article contains three main results: $i)$ the geometric type is a total invariant of conjugacy, $(ii)$ a pictorial and combinatorial criterion for determining when a given geometric type is realizable by a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is provided, and $(iii)$ we describe an algorithmic procedure for determining when two geometric types correspond to topologically conjugate pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Stability and Optimal Control Study of a Stochastic Within-Host COVID-19 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the stochastic SIV model for COVID-19 at the within-host level and explore its dynamics. We first examine the existence and positivity of the solution of the stochastic model using Ito's formula and establish exponential stability. Next, we extend the model to a stochastic optimal control problem and investigate the effectiveness of control measures, specifically antiviral drugs and immunomodulators. Numerical simulations are conducted to complement the theoretical results in both cases. Simulation suggests that the noises play a crucial role in the dynamics of the disease and disease can be eradicated with appropriate values of the stochastic coefficient. Stochastic optimal control study suggests that the viral load count in an infected individual decreases with the optimal treatment rates and is most effective when the antiviral and immunomodulating drugs are administered together.</description>

      <title>A parametrization algorithm to compute lower dimensional elliptic tori in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the construction of lower dimensional elliptic tori in parametric Hamiltonian systems by means of the parametrization method with the tangent and normal frequencies being prescribed. This requires that the Hamiltonian system has as many parameters as the dimension of the normal dynamics, and the algorithm must adjust these parameters. We illustrate the methodology with an implementation of the algorithm computing $2$--dimensional elliptic tori in a system of $4$ coupled pendula (4 degrees of freedom).</description>

      <title>Typical dimension and absolute continuity for classes of dynamically defined measures, Part II : exposition and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is partly an exposition, and partly an extension of our work [1] to the multiparameter case. We consider certain classes of parametrized dynamically defined measures. These are push-forwards, under the natural projection, of ergodic measures for parametrized families of smooth iterated function systems (IFS) on the line. Under some assumptions, most crucially, a transversality condition, we obtain formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of the measure and absolute continuity for almost every parameter in the appropriate parameter region. The main novelty of [1] and the present paper is that not only the IFS, but also the ergodic measure in the symbolic space, whose push-forward we consider, depends on the parameter. This includes many interesting families of measures, in particular, invariant measures for IFS's with place-dependent probabilities and natural (equilibrium) measures for smooth IFS's. One of the goals of this paper is to present an exposition of [1] in a more reader-friendly way, emphasizing the ideas and proof strategies, but omitting the more technical parts. This exposition/survey is based in part on the series of lectures by K\'aroly Simon at the Summer School "Dynamics and Fractals" in 2023 at the Banach Center, Warsaw. The main new feature, compared to [1], is that we consider multi-parameter families; in other words, the set of parameters is allowed to be multi-dimensional. This broadens the scope of applications. A new application considered here is to a class of Furstenberg-like measures.

      <title>Linear dynamical systems with continuous weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In discrete-time linear dynamical systems (LDSs), a linear map is repeatedly applied to an initial vector yielding a sequence of vectors called the orbit of the system. A weight function assigning weights to the points in the orbit can be used to model quantitative aspects, such as resource consumption, of a system modelled by an LDS. This paper addresses the problems to compute the mean payoff, the total accumulated weight, and the discounted accumulated weight of the orbit under continuous weight functions and polynomial weight functions as a special case. Besides general LDSs, the special cases of stochastic LDSs and of LDSs with bounded orbits are considered. Furthermore, the problem of deciding whether an energy constraint is satisfied by the weighted orbit, i.e., whether the accumulated weight never drops below a given bound, is analysed.</description>

      <title>Huygens Synchronization of Three Aligned Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the synchronization of three identical oscillators arranged in an array and coupled by small impacts, wherein each oscillator interacts solely with its nearest neighbor. The synchronized state, which is asymptotically stable, is characterized by phase opposition among alternating oscillators. We analyze the system using a non-linear discrete dynamical system based on a difference equation derived from the iteration of a plane diffeomorphism. We illustrate these results with the application to a system of three aligned Andronov clocks, showcasing their applicability to a broad range of oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Integrability-preserving regularizations of Laplacian Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplacian Growth (LG) model is known as a universality class of scale-free aggregation models in two dimensions, characterized by classical integrability and featuring finite-time boundary singularity formation. A discrete counterpart, Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (or DLA), has a similar local growth law, but significantly different global behavior. For both LG and DLA, a proper description for the scaling properties of long-time solutions is not available yet. In this note, we outline a possible approach towards finding the correct theory yielding a regularized LG and its relation to DLA.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Adaptive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical power conversions are common in a large variety of engineering applications. With reference to AC/DC and DC/AC power conversions, a strong research interest resides in multilevel converters, thanks to the many advantages they provide over standard two-level converters. In this paper, we first provide a power-oriented model of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs), followed by a detailed harmonic analysis. The model is given in the form of a block scheme that can be directly implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The performed harmonic analysis gives a deep and exact understanding of the different terms affecting the evolution of the voltage trajectories in the upper and lower arms of the converter. Next, we propose a new model-based adaptive control scheme for MMCs. The proposed control allows to determine the optimal average capacitor voltages reference in real-time, thus allowing to properly track the desired load current while minimizing the harmonic content in the generated load current itself.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the planar 5-body central configuration with a trapezoidal convex hull</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To apply Morse's critical point theory, we use mutual distances as coordinates to discuss a kind of central configuration of the planar Newtonian 5-body problem with a trapezoidal convex hull, i.e., four of the five bodies are located at the vertices of a trapezoid, and the fifth one is located on one of the parallel sides. We show that there is at most one central configuration of this geometrical shape for a given cyclic order of the five bodies along the convex hull.</description>

      <title>Smart abstraction based on iterative cover and non-uniform cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale approach for computing abstractions of dynamical systems, that incorporates both local and global optimal control to construct a goal-specific abstraction. For a local optimal control problem, we not only design the controller ensuring the transition between every two subsets (cells) of the state space but also incorporate the volume and shape of these cells into the optimization process. This integrated approach enables the design of non-uniform cells, effectively reducing the complexity of the abstraction. These local optimal controllers are then combined into a digraph, which is globally optimized to obtain the entire trajectory. The global optimizer attempts to lazily build the abstraction along the optimal trajectory, which is less affected by an increase in the number of dimensions. Since the optimal trajectory is generally unknown in practice, we propose a methodology based on the RRT* algorithm to determine it incrementally. Finally, we provide a tractable implementation of this algorithm for the optimal control of L-smooth nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flatness and E. Hopf's theorem for magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: J. Silverman proved that a dynamical system on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descends to the field of moduli if it is polynomial or it has even degree, but for non-polynomial ones of odd degree the picture is less clear. We give a complete characterization of which dynamical systems over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descend to the field of moduli.</description>
