      <title>Beta Canis Majoris: The Other Major Ionization Source of the Local Interstellar Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two nearby B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), are important contributors to the photoionization of the local interstellar clouds. At spectral type B1 II-III, $\beta$ CMa is slightly hotter than $\epsilon$ CMa (B2 II-III), but its ionizing flux at Earth is attenuated by a much larger H I column density. At the external surface of the clouds, the two stars produce similar fluxes in the Lyman continuum (LyC). From the $\beta$ CMa angular diameter, bolometric flux, and position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we obtain a consistent set of stellar parameters: $T_{\rm eff} = 25,180\pm1120$ K, $\log g = 3.70\pm0.08$, radius $R = 8.44\pm0.56\,R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13\pm1\,M_{\odot}$, and luminosity $L = 10^{4.41\pm0.06}\, L_{\odot}$. The EUVE-observed fluxes and non-LTE model atmospheres are used to determine the ionizing photon production rate $Q_{\rm H} = 10^{46.0}$ photons s$^{-1}$ and fluxes incident on the local clouds, $\Phi_{\rm HI} \approx 3700$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Phi_{\rm HeI} \approx 110$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the H I and He I continua. The corresponding photoionization rates are $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 1.5\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm HeI} \approx 7.3\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Within the local cloud, the LyC flux is attenuated by an H I column density $N_{\rm HI} = (1.9\pm0.1)\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 12.0\pm 0.6$ at the Lyman limit. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun approximately 4.4 Myr ago, with incident ionizing fluxes 180-200 times larger. Their EUV radiation photoionized and heated the tunnel in the local interstellar gas, associated dynamically with past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association.</description>

      <title>Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in 0313-192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03817v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc (projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim 610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$), and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas. Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet formation beyond traditional models.</description>

      <title>LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times 1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters in the Galaxy Cluster MACS0416 at z = 0.397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a photometric analysis of globular clusters (GCs) in the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397) using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PEARLS program. PSF photometry in the F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W filters was performed with DAOPHOT, yielding a catalog of 2,971 unresolved, point-like sources consistent with a GC population. Artificial star tests indicate 50% completeness at F200W = 30.63 AB mag and 80% completeness at F200W = 30.36 AB mag. Color-magnitude diagrams reveal broad color distributions with increasing scatter toward fainter magnitudes. We apply both the KMM algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Modeling to the F115W-F200W and F150W-F200W color indices, finding limits to possible subpopulations at the highest completeness thresholds. The globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) is modeled as a log-normal distribution modulated by a hyperbolic tangent completeness function. While the data do not reach the expected turnover magnitude at M_abs = -8.93 mag, the observed luminosity function peaks around M_F200W approximately -12 mag and declines sharply at fainter magnitudes due to incompleteness, probing only the bright tail of the GCLF.</description>

      <title>When Stars Mimic Monsters: Luminous Blue Variables in SBS 0335-052 E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed the detection of an active massive black hole (BH) in the low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052 E based on near-infrared (NIR) time variability and broad H$\alpha$ wings. This interpretation remains questionable given the observed broad wings in forbidden [O III] emission. Based on spectroscopic properties derived from our KCWI/KCRM integral-field observation of super star clusters 1 and 2 (SSCs 1$\&amp;$2), we propose instead that these BH signatures originate from a luminous blue variable (LBV) outburst in a binary system like $\eta$ Carinae. First, the [Fe II] emission-line ratio and detected O I 8446 pumped emission require high-density gas ($n_e \sim 10^6$ $\rm{cm^{-3}}$). This dense gas resides in the circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by pre-outburst stellar winds. Subsequent shock interaction between the LBV outburst ejecta and CSM efficiently produces warm dust and the corresponding NIR excess. Second, SSCs 1$\&amp;$2 are nitrogen-enriched relative to other SSCs. This enrichment arises from ejections of CNO-cycled material by multiple LBV outbursts. Third, we detect asymmetric broad H$\alpha$ wings extending from $\sim -5\,000$ to $\sim 10\,000\ \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This asymmetry results from electron scattering in the expanding, optically thick CSM. The proposed CSM shock interaction naturally explains the luminosities of [Fe V] and ultra-luminous X-ray emission. Contrarily, [Fe II] and [Fe IV] emission originates primarily from gas photoionized by the cool primary LBV and hot secondary stars, respectively. Our results highlight how the shock interaction of massive stars with high-density CSM mimics active massive BH signatures in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>PEACHES IV: Tracing the Formation &amp; Evolution of C$_2$H in Perseus Low-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radical hydrocarbon molecule C$_2$H is widely detected in various stages of star and planet formation, and has emerged as a useful tracer of high-C/O gas within the photochemically active surface layers of mature (Class II) protoplanetary disks. However, the chemistry and evolution of C$_2$H within younger (Class 0/I) protostars remains much more poorly understood. Here, using data observed as part of the PEACHES survey along with new ALMA ACA observations, we investigate the C$_2$H emission towards an unbiased sample of 35 Class 0/I low-mass protostars in Perseus. With this large sample, we identify a clear association between C$_2$H emission and the protostellar outflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anti-correlation between C$_2$H and SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C$_2$H is tracing photochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the C$_2$H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find values ranging from 10$^{14}$ -- 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in these sources. We also looked for trends in the C$_2$H emission morphology as a function of various protostellar evolutionary metrics, but find no clear patterns: the C$_2$H emission remains spatially extended in most sources, independent of age. This indicates that the transition to the compact C$_2$H emission observed on the surface of Class II disks must happen rapidly, sometime just after the embedded stage.</description>

      <title>Consistent gas-phase C/O abundances from UV and optical emission lines: a robust scale for chemical evolution across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C$^{2+}$ ion which is consistent with that of O$^{2+}$, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within $&lt;0.1$ dex, with an offset of $0.05\pm0.03$ dex in C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ for the standard T$_e$ method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 rotation curves in Yukawa gravity: phenomenology and Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yukawa gravity provides a generalized framework for modeling gravity modification. We investigate the rotation curve profiles of spiral galaxies under Yukawa-like theories governed by the coupling strength $\beta$ and the interaction range $\lambda$. We develop a unified analytical and numerical framework to calculate rotational velocities under Yukawa gravity, which includes contributions from all major galactic components: stellar bulge, disk, dark matter (DM) halo, and central supermassive black hole. The calculations show that $\beta$ and $\lambda$ strongly influence velocity distributions, shifting peaks, creating double-peak structures, or enhancing dark matter dominance in the bulge or disk. To assess observational implications, we perform Bayesian analyses using data from the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), which offer complementary characteristics: MW provides precise velocity profiles across multiple scales, while M31 includes broader morphological constraints. We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter, dark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard Newtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\lambda &lt; 1$ kpc yield high Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic kinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate this, yielding robust parameter estimates. However, in M31, Bayes factors favor Newtonian gravity, suggesting that current data lack the precision to resolve more complex models. This finding highlights two key needs: (i) realistic, physically or empirically informed priors to avoid biased constraints, and (ii) high-precision data with independent photometry to guard against overfitting. Our framework offers a scalable approach for testing gravity with large galactic rotation curve datasets.</description>

      <title>A second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium, referred to as having low "metallicity", preserve the chemical fingerprints of the first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest metallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other elements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first low-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a mystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies where they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star in the &gt;10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the lowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way (&lt;1/43,000th solar and ~1/160,000th solar), with a factor of &gt;3000x relative carbon enhancement. As the first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this object demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate in primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that carbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of energetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key local signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime inaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the early enrichment of the smallest galaxies.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for measuring gas-phase metallicities in intermediate-redshift non-AGN and AGN-host galaxies using future instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved measurements of gas-phase metallicities in galaxies that both do and do not host active galactic nuclei (AGN) are crucial for understanding the role of AGN in regulating galaxy growth over cosmic time. Recent work at $z=0$ has demonstrated that a self-consistent comparison of metallicities in AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies can be conducted within a Bayesian framework given sufficient coverage of rest-frame optical emission lines. The next generation of adaptive optics-assisted optical and near-infrared integral field spectrographs promise to deliver the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution required conduct comparable measurements at intermediate redshift ($z\sim 1-3$), albeit with a restricted set of emission lines dictated by the various filter and grating combinations available. In this work, we explore optimal strategies for recovering the metallicities of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies given these constraints. We consider suites of emission lines that will be practical to obtain at different redshifts, and test a range of strategies to measure metallicity using just these lines, evaluating their performance by comparison to measurements using all the lines to which we have access in $z=0$ optical spectra. Our results facilitate straightforward estimates of exposure times required by future instruments to reach specified accuracy goals in a range of redshift windows using optimal sets of lines, enabling the development of efficient observing strategies for future surveys. This study can be extended to spatially resolved galaxies in order to design optimal strategies for measuring metallicity fluctuation maps in addition to the mean metallicities we consider here.</description>

      <title>Bursting at the seams: the star-forming main sequence and its scatter at z=3-9 using NIRCam photometry from JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and its scatter at redshifts $3 \leq z \leq 9$, using NIRCam photometry from the JADES survey in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. Our analysis is based on a sample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\log \left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the SFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the specific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of $\mathrm{sSFR}\propto(1+z)^{\mu}$ with $\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good agreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way with the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty star formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the scatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging timescales, from $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.4-0.5~\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that shorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations in star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty SFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy initial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased burstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally, we emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when fitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.</description>

      <title>Can fractal dimension distinguish between grand-design and flocculent spiral arms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About two-thirds of disk galaxies host spiral arms, ranging from well-delineated grand-design spirals to fragmented flocculent spiral galaxies. We introduce fractal dimension $D_B$ as a non-parametric measure to distinguish between grand-designs and flocculents. We calculate the $D_B$ of 197 grand-designs and 322 flocculents from SDSS DR18, using the samples of \citet{Buta..2015} and \citet{Sarkar..2023}. Our calculated median values of $D_B$ are $1.29^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and $1.38^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ for the grand-designs and flocculents, respectively. In addition, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test rejects null hypothesis that these distributions are drawn from the same population. Finally, using a Random Forest (RF) model, we compare the effectiveness of $D_B$ in classifying spiral arm morphology, as compared to five other parameters viz. total atomic hydrogen HI mass $M_{HI}$, ratio of atomic hydrogen mass-to-blue luminosity $M_{HI} /L_B$, concentration index $C_i$, clumpiness $S$ and arm-contrast $C$. Our results indicate that $D_B$ has the highest feature index (30.8\%), followed by $C_i$ (26.0\%) and $M_{HI}$ (21.0\%). In fact, C, the metric routinely used to distinguish between the spiral morphologies has a feature importance of 8.3\%. Further, $D_B$ for grand-designs is found to anti-correlate with the central velocity dispersion with a correlation coefficient of -0.3 and $p \ll 0.05$. A high value of central velocity dispersion indicates a central Q-barrier, which favors the formation of grand designs according to the density wave theory. Thus, fractal dimension serves as a robust metric to distinguish between spiral morphologies and also links to the formation mechanism of spiral features.</description>

      <title>Investigating the residuals in the $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation using the SIMBA cosmological simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling relation between the black hole and stellar mass ($M_\bullet-M_*$), diagnosing the residual $\Delta \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)$ ($\Delta$) in this relation to understand the coevolution of the galaxy and black hole (BH) in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA. We showed that SIMBA can reproduce the observed $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation well with little difference between central and satellite galaxies. By using the median value to determine the residuals, we found that the residual is correlated with galaxy cold gas content, star formation rate, colour and black hole accretion properties. Both torque and Bondi models implemented in SIMBA, contribute to this residual, with torque accretion playing a major role at high redshift and low-mass galaxies, while Bondi (also BH merge) takes over at low redshift and massive galaxies. By dividing the sample into two populations: $\Delta&gt;0$ and $\Delta &lt;0$, we compared their evolution paths following the main progenitors. With evolution tracking, we proposed a simple picture for the BH-galaxy coevolution: Early-formed galaxies seeded black holes earlier, with stellar mass increasing rapidly to quickly reach the point of triggering `jet mode' feedback. This process reduced the cold gas content and stopped the growth of $M_*$, effectively quenching galaxies. Meanwhile, during the initial phase of torque accretion growth, the BH mass is comparable between galaxies formed early and those formed later. However, those galaxies that formed earlier appear to attain a marginally greater BH mass when shifting to Bondi accretion, aligning with the galaxy transition time. As the early-formed galaxies reach this point earlier -- leaving a longer time for them to have Bondi accretion as well as merging, their residuals become positive, i.e., having more massive BHs at $z=0$ compared to these late-formed galaxies at the same $M_*$. This picture is further supported by the strong positive correlation between the residuals and the galaxy age, which we are proposing as a verification with observation data on this story suggested by SIMBA.</description>

      <title>Detection of the linear SiC$_3$ and SiC$_5$ radicals in IRC\,+10216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detected the linear $^3\Sigma^-$ radicals SiC$_3$ and SiC$_5$ toward IRC+10216 using an ultrasensitive line survey gathered with the Yebes 40\,m radio telescope. The derived column densities of $l$-SiC$_3$ and $l$-SiC$_5$ are (3.6$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.8$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The linear SiC$_3$ radical is $\sim$2 times less abundant that its singlet rhomboidal prolate isomer, for which we provide a new analysis based on recent sensitive observations in the Q band (7\,mm), and at 3 and 2\,mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. The emission detected from these species arises from the cool external layers of the circumstellar envelope. We speculate whether ion-neutral routes involving SiC$_n$H$_m$$^+$ cations or neutral-neutral reactions involving Si and SiC$_2$ could efficiently synthesize these species.</description>

      <title>Parallel Alignments between Magnetic Fields and Dense Structures in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area Central Molecular Zone Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey with SOFIA has mapped plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientations within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. Applying the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) analysis to the FIREPLACE data, we find that the relative orientation between magnetic fields and column density structures is random in low-density regions (2x10^22&lt;N(H2)&lt;10^23 cm^{-2}), but becomes preferentially parallel in high-density regions (&gt;10^23 cm^{-2}). This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds, where the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between individual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with MHD simulations specific to the CMZ conditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic rather than artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel configuration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are not self-gravitating, as they are in super-virial states, except for the mini-starburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star formation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations for Dark Matter Halos Hosting Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the extraction of parameters of dark matter halos hosting ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\cal O}(10)$ identified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario is likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least initially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter profile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo parameter ($\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be unconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can be well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light mass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the largest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the presence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major III is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass estimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor unconstrained from below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>Hot springs and dust reservoirs: JWST reveals the dusty, molecular aftermath of extragalactic stellar mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of four Luminous Red Novae (LRNe): dusty, extragalactic transients from stellar mergers following common-envelope evolution (CEE) in massive binary stars. Our targets - AT2021blu, AT2021biy, AT2018bwo, and M31-LRN-2015 - span a broad range in progenitor primary masses ($\approx$3-24M$_{\odot}$) and post-merger ages ($\approx$1100-3700 days). All four were observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 5-25$\mu$m; AT2021blu and AT2021biy additionally have 5-12$\mu$m spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer. These spectra show strong features of oxygen-rich molecules, including water vapor, supporting the recent association of water fountain sources with CEE. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions yields dust masses of $\approx$4.2$\times10^{-5}$, 3$\times10^{-4}$, 7.5$\times10^{-5}$, and 7.7$\times10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$ respectively - corresponding to $\approx10$%, 60%, 6% and 12% of median dust masses in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) at similar phases. Accounting for their occurrence rates, we estimate that LRNe can contribute $\sim$25% as much dust as CCSNe to the cosmic dust budget. Furthermore, the lower expansion velocities of LRNe may reduce dust destruction by reverse shocks compared to CCSNe, potentially increasing this contribution. In addition to dust masses, we use our \emph{JWST} observations to measure late-time properties such as the luminosities, temperatures, radii, and dust-to-gas ratios of the merger remnants. Our results highlight the need for broader infrared studies of LRNe to quantify their contribution to the cosmic dust budget, study the evolution of oxygen-rich molecules, and probe the final fates of CEE.</description>

      <title>Probing globular clusters using modulated gravitational waves from binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are crucial for studying stellar dynamics and galactic structure, yet precise measurements of their distances and masses are often limited by uncertainties in electromagnetic (EM) observations. We present a novel method that leverages gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) orbiting within GCs to enhance the precision of GC parameter measurements. The BBH's orbital motion imprints characteristic modulations on the GW waveform, encoding information about the host GC. Using post-Newtonian waveforms and Lorentz transformations, we simulate modulated GW signals and evaluate the resulting parameter constraints via a Fisher information matrix analysis. Our results show that incorporating GW observations can significantly reduce the uncertainties in GC distance and mass measurements, in many cases achieving improvements by an order of magnitude. These findings demonstrate the value of BBHs as dynamical probes and highlight the power of GWs to advance GC studies beyond the limits of traditional EM methods.</description>

      <title>Stringent constraint on the CCC+TL cosmology with $H(z)$ Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that are challenging to reconcile with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\Lambda$CDM model works well. Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly favors $\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\Delta \mathrm{BIC} = 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\alpha$ disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\sim 6\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between 12-20 Msun focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss ~10^-4-10^-2 Msun/yr in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM (&gt;~10^-15 g/cm^3 at distances &lt;~10^15 cm) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

Abstract: We report the first detection of water activity in the third confirmed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, based on ultraviolet imaging with the \emph{Neil Gehrels-Swift Observatory}. Observations acquired with the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on 2025 July 31st - Aug 1st revealed OH (A$^2\Sigma$ -- X$^2\Pi$) emission near 3085~\AA. The water production rate results highly depend on the reddening assumption. For a reddening of 38.6\% between 5437.8~\AA\ and 3325.7~\AA, the water production rate is $(1.35 \pm 0.27) \times 10^{27} $ molecules\,s$^{-1}$ (40~kg\,s$^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 3.51~au. This places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond 3~au, where water ice sublimation is typically inefficient. The inferred production rate is consistent with an active area of at least 19~km$^2$, assuming equilibrium sublimation. Based on current upper limits of the nucleus' radius, this requires that over 20\% of the surface is active, which is larger than activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous near-infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of large icy grains in the coma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor. The detection of OH emission prior to any CN detection is unusual and may reflect differences in grain-driven outgassing or volatile inventory compared to typical comets. While similar behavior has been observed in solar system comets, the mechanisms controlling distant activity and the storage and release of volatiles remain poorly understood. If 3I/ATLAS' coma continues to be dominated by H$_2$O, supporting the early and low-metallicity formation hypothesis, the derived large size of the nucleus could be indicative of a key knowledge gap in low-metallicity system planetesimal formation and loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes and inspirals from it: Exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an uncharged test particle in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, two classes of remarkable orbits are worked out, both in exact forms. First, for both prograde and retrograde motions, the radii of innermost stable circular orbits are expressed fully in terms of the outer and inner horizon radii just like Kerr black holes, despite the fact that Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes have three parameters. Second, closed analytic solutions are given to the problem of a test particle inspiraling toward the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole from innermost stable circular orbits at the infinitely distant past. These exact solutions can serve as a springboard for more general solutions and astrophysical applications in the future.</description>

      <title>A transition from H$_2$O to C$_2$H$_2$ dominated spectra with decreasing stellar luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C$_2$H$_2$ and H$_2$O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri ($M_{*}$$&gt;$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) and very low-mass star (VLMS, $M_{*}$$\leq$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher $F_{\rm{C_2H_2}}$/$F_{\rm{H_2O}}$ flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm ($\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal filaments and AGN recurrent activity in the galaxy group Nest200047: a LOFAR, uGMRT, MeerKAT, VLA radio spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.</description>

      <title>The CatSouth Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Southern Sky and a Unified All-Sky Catalog Based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>

      <title>An analytic formalism to describe the $N_{\rm eff}(\rm H)$-$n_{\rm H}$ relationship in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic, far-ultraviolet radiation field. In three-dimensional simulations, this can be calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically motivated formalism to predict the average relationship between the effective hydrogen-nuclei column density, $N_{\rm eff}({\rm H})$, and the local hydrogen-nuclei number density, $n_{\rm H}$. Methods. We construct an analytic model utilizing characteristic length scales that connects the turbulence-dominated regime and the gravitational-dominated regime at high-density. Results. The model well-reproduces a previous analytic fit to simulation results and is consistent with the high-density power-law indices, e.g., $N_{\rm eff}(H) \propto n^{\gamma}$, of $\gamma \approx 0.4 - 0.5$ found in previous numerical simulations utilizing ray-tracing. Conclusions. We present an analytic model relating the average effective column density, $N_{\rm eff}$, to the local number density, $n_{\rm H}$, which reproduces the behaviors found in three-dimensional simulations. The analytic model can be utilized as a sub-grid prescription for shielded molecular gas or in astrochemical models for a physically motivated estimation of the attenuating column density.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of the $n \Sigma v$ approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In kinetic theory, the classic $n \Sigma v$ approach calculates the rate of particle interactions from local quantities: the number density of particles $n$, the cross-section $\Sigma$, and the average relative speed $v$. In stellar dynamics, this formula is often applied to problems in collisional (i.e. dense) environments such as globular and nuclear star clusters, where blue stragglers, tidal capture binaries, binary ionizations, and micro-tidal disruptions arise from rare close encounters. The local $n \Sigma v$ approach implicitly assumes the ergodic hypothesis, which is not well motivated for the densest star systems in the Universe. In the centers of globular and nuclear star clusters, orbits close into 1D ellipses because of the degeneracy of the potential (either Keplerian or harmonic). We find that the interaction rate in perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potentials is determined by a global quantity -- the number of orbital intersections -- and that this rate can be far lower or higher than the ergodic $n \Sigma v$ estimate. However, we find that in most astrophysical systems, deviations from a perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potential (due to e.g. granularity or extended mass) trigger sufficient orbital precession to recover the $n \Sigma v$ interaction rate. Astrophysically relevant failures of the $n \Sigma v$ approach only seem to occur for tightly bound stars orbiting intermediate-mass black holes, or for the high-mass end of collisional cascades in certain debris disks.</description>
