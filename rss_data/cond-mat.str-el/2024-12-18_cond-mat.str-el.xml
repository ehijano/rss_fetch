      <title>Physics-informed Transformers for Electronic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently autoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to describe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially depends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical interpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified variational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to construct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state that serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a Transformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections to the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally efficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach using a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and employing Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed bases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the natural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way for more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of quadrupolar order under magnetic field in $5d^2$ double perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the time-reversal symmetry breaking signal in muon spin relaxation below a transition temperature without accompanying noticeable magnetic Bragg peaks in $5d^2$ Os double perovskites, a rare ferro-octupolar order was proposed to account for such hidden order. Here we study the phase transitions under a magnetic field in triangular and face-centered cubic lattices using classical Monte Carlo simulations. It is expected that higher-rank moments do not couple linearly to the magnetic field. Consequently, a field applied along the ferro-octupolar order is not anticipated to influence the ordering. However, we observe the emergence of antiferro-quadrupolar ordering mixed with the antiferro-octupolar order (AFQO) due to the field-induced bond-dependent exchange interaction. This field-linear interaction among non-Kramer doublets arises via the coupling to the excited triplet states enabled by the external field. In the triangular lattice, we uncover intriguing vortex states, which could inspire future research into $5d^2$ triangular lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic phases and thermodynamics of CuB_2O_4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The copper metaborate CuB2O4 (CBO) has been studied within the parametric space of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct phases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as magnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B vs T phase diagram for B = 0-9 T (B perpendicular to the c axis) and T = 0.1-25 K, utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper and intricate understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Taking CBO as an example, the present work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems arXiv:2402.14916. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-entangled electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ studied by O $K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal ions with $5d^2$ electronic configuration in a cubic crystal field are prone to have a vanishing dipolar magnetic moment but finite higher-order multipolar moments, and they are expected to exhibit exotic physical properties. Through an investigation using resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS), Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical ligand-field multiplet and $ab initio$ calculations, we fully characterized the electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, particularly, the crystal-field symmetry of the 5$d^2$ electrons in this anomalous material. The low-energy multiplet excitations from RIXS at the oxygen $K$ edge and Raman-active phonons both show no splitting, confirming the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion. These findings are consistent with the ground state with the 'hidden order' of magnetic octupoles. Obtained parameters pave the way for further realistic microscopic studies of this highly unusual class of materials, advancing our understanding of spin-orbit physics in systems with higher-order multipoles.</description>

      <title>Revealing spinons by proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ghost-Gutzwiller variational wavefunction within the Gutzwiller approximation is shown to stabilize a genuine paramagnetic Mott insulator in the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This phase hosts quasiparticles that are crucial to the paramagnetic response without showing up in the single-particle spectrum, and, as such, they can be legitimately regarded as an example of Anderson's spinons. We demonstrate that these spinons at the interface with a metal reacquire charge by proximity effect and thus reemerge in the spectrum as a heavy-fermion band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of EuAlSi, a compound comprising a honeycomb lattice of Al and Si atoms and a triangular lattice of Eu atoms, are presented. Moreover, we have prepared the Eu1-xSrxAlSi solid solution, to study the evolution of the collective quantum properties from the ferromagnetic EuAlSi towards the superconducting SrAlSi. A possible quantum critical point is suggested to exist in the vicinity of to x of 0.96, at which the suppression of ferromagnetic order is concomitant with the emergence of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and weak electronic correlations in Kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one class of typical quantum materials, Kagome metals in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) have attracted extensive attentions due to their interesting physical properties and different quantum phases of charge density wave (CDW), superconductivity and nontrivial topology. Recently, a new CDW phase in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ was experimentally observed and inspired a wide study of the mechanism of driving force. To have a clear understanding of the correlation effect in the CDW phase in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we performed a systematic density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT) calculations. The resulting static local spin susceptibility is nearly independent of temperature, indicating the absence of local moment on atom V, in full agreement with experimental measurements. The mass enhancements of quasiparticles and
  bandwidth renormalizations near the Fermi level show a weak correlation strength in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. In addition, the comparable mass enhancements of quasiparticles in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ with CDW order and YV$_6$Sn$_6$ without CDW phase suggests that electronic correlations corresponding to Fermi surface nesting do not play the dominant role in the formation of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>Theory of electron-phonon interactions in extended correlated systems probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging application of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is the study of lattice excitations and electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions in quantum materials. Despite the growing importance of this area of research, the community lacks a complete understanding of how the RIXS process excites the lattice and how these excitations encode information about the $e$-ph interactions. Here, we present a detailed study of the RIXS spectra of the Hubbard-Holstein model defined on extended one-dimensional lattices. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we compute the RIXS response while treating the electron mobility, many-body interactions, and core-hole interactions on an equal footing. The predicted spectra exhibit notable differences from those obtained using the commonly adopted Lang-Firsov models, with important implications for analyzing past and future experiments. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how RIXS probes $e$-ph interactions and set the stage for a more realistic analysis of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Behavior of Transport Properties in Non-Magnetic RuO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a prototypical altermagnet, RuO$_{2}$ has been subject to many controversial reports regarding its magnetic ground state and the existence of crystal Hall effects. We obtained high-quality RuO$_{2}$ single crystal with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 152), and carefully measured its magnetization, longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) up to 35 T magnetic field. We also calculated its electronic band, Fermi surface, and conducted numerical simulations for its transport properties. It was found that no magnetic transition occurs below 400 K, and that all the transport properties are consistent with the numerical simulations results, indicating that the magnetotransport properties originate from the intrinsic electronic structures and are dominated by the Lorentz force. Particularly, no crystal Hall effects were observed in our RuO$_{2}$ samples and both magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity follow scaling behavior. These results demonstrate that RuO$_{2}$ is a typical semimetal, rather than an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behavior of Magnetoresistance and Hall Resistivity in Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of altermagnet (AM) marks a significant advancement in magnetic materials, combining characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In this Letter, we focus on CrSb, which has been verified to be an AM and to exhibit substantial spin splitting near the Fermi level. After successfully growing high-quality CrSb single crystals, we performed comprehensive magnetization, magnetoresistance (MR), and Hall resistivity measurements, along with the electronic structure, and Fermi surface (FS) calculations, as well as the magneto-transport property numerical simulations. An antiferromagnetic transition occurring at $T_{N}$ = 712 K was reconfirmed. It was found that both experimental MR and Hall resistivity are consistent with the numerical simulation results, and exhibit obvious scaling behavior. The nonlinear Hall resistivity is due to its multi-band structure, rather than an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Especially, the scaling behavior in Hall resistivity is first observed within an AM material. These findings demonstrate that the magneto-transport properties in CrSb originate from the intrinsic electronic structure and are dominated by the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</description>

      <title>Polynomially efficient quantum enabled variational Monte Carlo for training neural-network quantum states for physico-chemical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ans\"atze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a Galilean quantum Hall crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic effective field theory for Galilean-invariant quantum Hall systems with spontaneously broken translational symmetry. Neglecting the role of energy conservation in a low-temperature regime, the hydrodynamic mode is a magnetophonon with quartic attenuation: $\omega\sim \pm k^2-\mathrm{i} k^z$ with $z=4$. However, this linear response theory is unstable, and flows to a non-trivial dynamical universality class with $z\approx 3$. We observe this scaling in numerical simulations of many-body classical Hamiltonian dynamics, in a model of an electronic crystal in the lowest Landau level. Observing this magnetophonon decay rate in a quantum Hall crystal represents a promising setting to detect an analogue of a "fractonic dynamical universality class" in a solid-state system, e.g. using microwave impedance microscopy.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of magnetization-induced band renormalization and strong spin-charge-lattice coupling in EuZn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel superconducting materials is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with a wealth of potential for applications in energy, transportation, and computing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled expediting the search for new materials by efficiently utilizing vast materials databases. In this study, we developed an approach based on deep learning (DL) to predict new superconducting materials. We have synthesized a compound derived from our DL network and confirmed its superconducting properties in agreement with our prediction. Our approach is also compared to previous work based on random forests (RFs). In particular, RFs require knowledge of the chem-ical properties of the compound, while our neural net inputs depend solely on the chemical composition. With the help of hints from our network, we discover a new ternary compound $\textrm{Mo}_{20}\textrm{Re}_{6}\textrm{Si}_{4}$, which becomes superconducting below 5.4 K. We further discuss the existing limitations and challenges associated with using AI to predict and, along with potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Observing dynamical localization on a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancements of quantum processors offer a promising new window to study exotic states of matter. One striking example is the possibility of non-ergodic behaviour in systems with a large number of local degrees of freedom. Here we use a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor to study a disorder-free $S=1$ Floquet model, which becomes prethermal by dynamic localization due to local spin interactions. We theoretically describe and experimentally observe an emergent $3T$ subharmonic response, demonstrating the ability to witness non-ergodic dynamics beyond qubit systems. Our numerical simulations reveal the role played by multipartite entanglement through the Quantum Fisher Information, showing how this quantity successfully reflects the transition between ergodic and localized regimes in a non-equilibrium context. These results pave the way for the study of ergodicity-breaking mechanisms in higher-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements -- capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments -- and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert-space structure of dimers of two sites. The protocol is sample efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our work introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as that of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.</description>

      <title>Topological order in spin nematics from the quantum melting of a disclination lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological defects of Spin($n+1$) nematics in two spatial dimensions, known as disclinations, are characterized by the $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^n) = \textrm{Z}_2$ homotopy group for $n\ge2$. We argue that incompressible quantum liquids of disclinations can exist as stable low-temperature phases and host composite quasiparticles which combine a fractional amount of fundamental Z$_2$ charge with a unit of topological charge. The four-fold topological ground state degeneracy on a torus admits a fermionic or semionic quasiparticle exchange statistics. The topological non-triviality of these states is visible in the existence of protected gapless edge modes. While the fermionic nematic and gapped Z$_2$ spin liquids have equivalent topological orders, they are still thermodynamically distinct due to having different edge modes, in analogy to the topologically non-trivial and trivial states of quantum spin-Hall systems. The analysis proceeds by recasting the Z$_2$ gauge theory of spin nematics as a continuum limit theory with a larger gauge structure. Nematic fractionalization parallels that of a quantum Hall liquid, but the large gauge symmetry restores the time-reversal symmetry and restricts the quasiparticle fusion rules and statistics. The conclusions from field theory analysis are complemented with the construction of plausible host microscopic models.</description>

Abstract: In a spin chain governed by a local Hamiltonian, we consider a microcanonical ensemble in the middle of the energy spectrum and a contiguous subsystem whose length is a constant fraction of the system size. We prove that if the bandwidth of the ensemble is greater than a certain constant, then the average entanglement entropy (between the subsystem and the rest of the system) of eigenstates in the ensemble deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of (chaotic) local Hamiltonians and that of random states. We also prove that the former deviates from the thermodynamic entropy at the same energy by at least a positive constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCNR) was recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{Yin:2022toc} as a measure of multipartite entanglement in a condensed matter context. In this short note, we point out that it is closely related to the $(2,n)$-R\'enyi reflected entropy, which has been studied in the context of AdS/CFT. We discuss the calculation of the CCNR in random tensor networks as well as holographic CFTs. The holographic dual involves a backreacted entanglement wedge cross section in a geometry sourced by R\'enyi-2 cosmic branes. We perform explicit calculations for two intervals in a hyperbolic random tensor network as well the vacuum state of a 2D holographic CFT, and analyze the occurence of a connected-to-disconnected phase transition. The example illustrates the validity of the proposal for analytic continuation in holography for arbitrary values of R\'enyi parameter $n$. We comment on a symmetry-resolved generalization of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Variational Quantum Eigensolver to detect Phase Transitions through Energy Level Crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of neural-network quantum states (NQSs) has made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of strongly-correlated systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from Heating to non-heating in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy dynamics of two-dimensional topological matter hinges on its one-dimensional edge modes. Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge modes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain braiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a framework for characterizing one-dimensional out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their effective potential and temperature, both arising from anyonic braiding, as well as the landscape of their excitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type of the tunneling quasiparticles; non-equilibrium anyonic states are underlain by power-law energy distributions. This allows "hot" anyons to tunnel above the chemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal witness function. Our analysis raises the prospect of generalizing the kinetic approach to compressible anyonic matter in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization, magnetization, and superconductivity in bilayer graphene near the van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin density wave state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>
