      <title>Solving The Travelling Salesman Problem Using A Single Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a popular NP-hard-combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding the optimal way for a salesman to travel through different cities once and return to the initial city. The existing methods of solving TSPs on quantum systems are either gate-based or binary variable-based encoding. Both approaches are resource-expensive in terms of the number of qubits while performing worse compared to existing classical algorithms even for small-size problems. We present an algorithm that solves an arbitrary TSP using a single qubit by invoking the principle of quantum parallelism. The cities are represented as quantum states on the Bloch sphere while the preparation of superposition states allows us to traverse multiple paths at once. The underlying framework of our algorithm is a quantum version of the classical Brachistochrone approach. Optimal control methods are employed to create a selective superposition of the quantum states to find the shortest route of a given TSP. The numerical simulations solve a sample of four to nine cities for which exact solutions are obtained. The algorithm can be implemented on any quantum platform capable of efficiently rotating a qubit and allowing state tomography measurements. For the TSP problem sizes considered in this work, our algorithm is more resource-efficient and accurate than existing quantum algorithms with the potential for scalability. A potential speed-up of polynomial time over classical algorithms is discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Convex Optimization Requires Superlinear Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any memory-constrained, first-order algorithm which minimizes $d$-dimensional, $1$-Lipschitz convex functions over the unit ball to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$ accuracy using at most $d^{1.25 - \delta}$ bits of memory must make at least $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1 + (4/3)\delta})$ first-order queries (for any constant $\delta \in [0, 1/4]$). Consequently, the performance of such memory-constrained algorithms are a polynomial factor worse than the optimal $\tilde{O}(d)$ query bound for this problem obtained by cutting plane methods that use $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ memory. This resolves a COLT 2019 open problem of Woodworth and Srebro.</description>
