      <title>Structure and Spectroscopy of Criegee Intermediates in Gas- and Aqueous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics and spectroscopy of the small (H$_2$COO) and large (CH$_3$CHOO) Criegee intermediates (CIs) in the gas phase, inside/on water droplets, on amorphous solid water (ASW) and in bulk water are investigated using validated energy functions. For both species, facile diffusion between surface and inside positions for water droplets are found whereas on amorphous solid water at low temperatures (50 K) no surface diffusion is observed on the multiple-nanosecond time scale. This is at variance with other species, such as CO or NO on ASW. The infrared spectroscopy of both CIs in contact with an aqueous environment leads to shifts of the spectral features on the order of a few to a few tens of cm$^{-1}$, depending on the vibrational mode considered. This is consistent with Stark-induced spectral shifts for small molecules in protein environments. However, the spectroscopy of both CIs in contact with water droplets does not depend on the positioning relative to the droplet (inside vs. surface).</description>

      <title>Black-Box Uncertainty Estimation for Deep Learning Models in Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an ensemble-based approach for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in atomistic neural networks. This method generates an epistemic uncertainty signal without requiring changes to the underlying multi-headed regression neural network architecture, making it suitable for sealed or black-box models. We apply this method to molecular systems, specifically sodium (Na) and aluminum (Al), under various temperature conditions. By scaling the uncertainty signal, we account for heteroscedasticity in the data. We demonstrate the robustness of the scaled UQ signal for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior in several scenarios. This UQ signal also correlates with model convergence during training, providing an additional tool for optimizing the training process.</description>

      <title>Connecting Collisional and Photofragmentation Resonances in the H$_2$ Ungerade Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed energy-dependent frame transformation theory that incorporates both ionization and dissociation channels of the H$_2$ molecule, is extended to treat the ungerade states that occur both in dissociative recombination and as the final state in ground state photoabsorption. The theoretical treatment includes the rotational degrees of freedom and is benchmarked against a two-dimensional model that can be solved with high accuracy and also compared with photoabsorption experiments. Analysis of the resulting spectra shows how the same resonances appear in very different observables, often with quite different line shapes.</description>

      <title>LOCAL: A Locality-based Active Learning Framework for Predicting the Stability of Dual-Atom Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (DAC/NG) are emerging as a family of promising catalysts that can overcome intrinsic limitations of single-atom catalysts. However, comprehensive assessment of their structural stability is prohibitively demanding due to a vast local configurational space. Here we introduce LOCAL, a locality-based framework that combines graph convolutional networks with active learning to efficiently predict DAC/NG stability by leveraging chemically intuitive locality quantified by crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LOCAL over a comprehensive dataset of 611,648 DAC/NG structures, achieving a test mean absolute error of 0.15~eV while invoking density functional theory calculations for only 16,704 structures (2.7% of the dataset). Thus, LOCAL enables efficient and accurate construction of phase diagrams for DAC/NG across diverse compositions reciprocally validated with experimentally synthesized configurations for representative systems. Our framework composes an essential methodology for accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-performance complex catalysts.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the aqueous redox properties of functionalized quinones using a new QM/MM variational formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 014113 (2024)]. This approach is particularly appropriate to account for solvent effect into QM calculations. We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Connections between Richardson-Gaudin States, Perfect-Pairing, and Pair Coupled-Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation. Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of pair-based ans\"atze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.</description>
