      <title>Enhancing Investment Analysis: Optimizing AI-Agent Collaboration in Financial Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in financial analysis and investment decision-making has gained significant attention. However, most existing approaches rely on single-agent systems, which fail to fully utilize the collaborative potential of multiple AI agents. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments. This study highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in transforming financial analysis and investment decision-making by integrating diverse analytical perspectives.</description>

      <title>The TruEnd-procedure: Treating trailing zero-valued balances in credit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans in the dataset with `false' observations. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of zero (or very small) month-end balances that persist towards the end. Identifying these trails of diminutive balances would require an exact definition of a "small balance", which can be found using our so-called TruEnd-procedure. We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using residential mortgages from a large South African bank. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of certain risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model such as survival analysis. Excess histories can be discarded using the ideal small-balance definition, which demonstrably improves the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the monetary value of the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under the IFRS 9 accounting standard. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.</description>
