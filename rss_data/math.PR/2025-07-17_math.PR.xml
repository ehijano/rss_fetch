      <title>Large-scale distributed synchronization systems, using a cancel-on-completion redundancy mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent distributed synchronization systems, which are modeled as $n$ particles moving on the real line. This class generalizes the model of a multi-server queueing system, considered in [15], employing so-called cancel-on-completion (c.o.c.) redundancy mechanism, but is motivated by other applications as well. The model in [15] is a particle system, regulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is such that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no regulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the number of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job arrival rates per particle remain constant. The results include: the existence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe the limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic independence (concentration, as $n \to\infty$, of the stationary distribution on a single state, which is necessarily an ML fixed point); the limits, as $n \to\infty$, of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system advances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and generalize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical development is such that the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a unified framework. In particular, these systems are used as tools for analysis of each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary last passage percolation (LPP) with geometric weights in a half-space geometry. The two-parameter stationary measure for this model has recently been characterized, with the boundary parameter r and the parameter s which describes the initial condition at infinity. For each pair (r, s) in the high-density phase, we derive an explicit formula for the distribution of the stationary LPP along the diagonal and also find its asymptotic distribution under critical scaling.</description>

      <title>A Block Reduction Method for Random Band Matrices with General Variance Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel block reduction method for the study of a general class of random band matrices (RBM) defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_{L}^d:=\{1,2,\ldots,L\}^{d}$ for $d\in \{1,2\}$, with band width $W$ and an almost arbitrary variance profile subject to a core condition. We prove the delocalization of bulk eigenvectors for such RBMs under the assumptions $W\ge L^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ in one dimension and $W\geq L^{\varepsilon}$ in two dimensions, where $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small constant. This result extends the findings of arXiv:2501.01718 and arXiv:2503.07606 on block RBMs to models with general variance profiles. Furthermore, we generalize our results to Wegner orbital models with small interaction strength $\lambda\ll 1$. Under the sharp condition $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish optimal lower bounds for the localization lengths of bulk eigenvectors, thereby extending the results of arXiv:2503.11382 to settings with nearly arbitrary potential and hopping terms. Our block reduction method provides a powerful and flexible framework that reduces both the dynamical analysis of the loop hierarchy and the derivation of deterministic estimates for general RBMs to the corresponding analysis of block RBMs, as developed in arXiv:2501.01718, arXiv:2503.07606 and arXiv:2503.11382.</description>

      <title>Dimers with layered disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimer model on the square grid, with quenched random edge weights. Randomness is chosen to have a layered structure, similar to that of the celebrated McCoy-Wu disordered Ising model. Disorder has a highly non-trivial effect and it produces an essential singularity of the free energy, with $e^{-\sqrt{{\rm distance}}}$ decay of dimer-dimer correlations, at a point of the ``liquid'' (or ``massless'') phase where the homogeneous dimer model has instead a real analytic free energy and correlations decaying like $1/({\rm distance})^2$. Moreover, at a point where the homogeneous model has a transition between a massive (gaseous) and massless (liquid) phase, the critical exponent 3/2 (Pokrovsky-Talapov law), characteristic of the transition between the two regimes, is modified by disorder into an exponent that ranges continuously between 3/2 and infinity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Ripple XRP for Cross-Border Settlement Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feasibility of XRP as a liquidity medium in cross-border transactions is assessed in this paper using a thorough stochastic framework. We use simulations of settlement latency, regime-switching volatility, and jump-diffusion models. The models are calibrated using historical data from public exchanges and RippleNet corridors, and they assess FX dynamics, liquidity depth, and tail risks in real-world scenarios. The behavior of XRP differs significantly from the conventional GBM assumptions, according to the results, and stochastic volatility with regime awareness provides a reliable path to corridor optimization. Our empirical validation shows that adding volatility feedback and routing adjustments significantly increases remittance success rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Steiner entire function, an analytic generating function for the intrinsic volumes of a convex compact set in a Hilbert space. This function extends the classical Steiner polynomial to infinite dimensions and encodes key geometric information about the set. We establish fundamental results on its order, type, and canonical product representation, and show how its analytic growth properties characterize Gaussian continuity. In particular, we provide new criteria for this property in terms of entire function theory, disprove a conjecture of Gao and Vitale, and conjecture a new characterization of admissible intrinsic volume sequences in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Turnpike properties in linear quadratic Gaussian N-player differential games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of equilibrium strategies and state trajectories in a linear quadratic $N$-player game with Gaussian initial data. By analyzing convergence toward the corresponding ergodic game, we establish exponential convergence estimates between the solutions of the finite-horizon Riccati system and the associated algebraic Riccati system arising in the ergodic setting. Building on these results, we prove the convergence of the time-averaged value function and derive a turnpike property for the equilibrium pairs of each player. Importantly, our approach avoids reliance on the mean field game limiting model, allowing for a fully uniform analysis with respect to the number of players $N$. As a result, we further establish a uniform turnpike property for the equilibrium pairs between the finite-horizon and ergodic games with $N$ players.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of large rank perturbations of large random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.</description>

      <title>Liouville Quantum Duality and Random Planar Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models of block-weighted random planar maps in which possibly decorated maps are decomposed canonically into blocks, each block receiving the weight $u$. These maps present a transition at some critical value $u=u_{cr}$ above which the maps degenerate into Brownian trees. We show that the enumerative properties and critical exponents of the maps at $u=u_{cr}$ and those for $u&lt;u_{cr}$ are connected by duality relations which are precisely those expected in the context of the Liouville quantum gravity description of random surfaces. We illustrate this result by various instances of block-weighted maps: random planar quadrangulations decomposed into simple blocks, Hamiltonian cycles on cubic or bicubic planar maps decomposed into irreducible blocks, and meandric systems.</description>

      <title>Designing Algorithms for Entropic Optimal Transport from an Optimisation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a collection of novel methods for the entropic-regularised optimal transport problem, which are inspired by existing mirror descent interpretations of the Sinkhorn algorithm used for solving this problem. These are fundamentally proposed from an optimisation perspective: either based on the associated semi-dual problem, or based on solving a non-convex constrained problem over subset of joint distributions. This optimisation viewpoint results in non-asymptotic rates of convergence for the proposed methods under minimal assumptions on the problem structure. We also propose a momentum-equipped method with provable accelerated guarantees through this viewpoint, akin to those in the Euclidean setting. The broader framework we develop based on optimisation over the joint distributions also finds an analogue in the dynamical Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Remote Monitoring through Noisy Random Access with Retransmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a rare event monitoring system consisting of a set of devices and a base station, where devices transmit information about rare events to the base station using a random multiple access scheme. We introduce a model in which the presence of noise in the multiple access channel can cause message loss even in the absence of transmission collisions. The occurrence of events is modeled by a family of independent two-state Markov chains (with states 0 and 1). We analyze how repeated transmissions affect system performance. Two efficiency criteria are proposed and studied: the maximum probability that a message about an event from a fixed device is successfully delivered to the base station and the maximum frequency at which the base station successfully receives updates about the entire system. For each criterion, we determine the optimal number of retransmissions as a function of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent balls and bins model with positive feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balls and bins models are classical probabilistic models where balls are added to bins at random according to a certain rule. The balls and bins model with feedback is a non-linear generalisation of the P\'olya urn, where the probability of a new ball choosing a bin with $m$ balls is proportional to $m^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ being the feedback parameter. It is known that if the feedback is positive (i.e. $\alpha&gt;1$) then the model is monopolistic: there is a finite time after which one of the bins will receive all incoming balls. We consider a time-dependent version of this model, where $\sigma_n$ independent balls are added at time $n$ instead of just one. We show that if $\alpha&gt;1$ then one of the bins gets all but a negligible number of balls, and identify a phase transition in the growth of $(\sigma_n)$ between the monopolistic and non-monopolistic behaviour. We also describe the critical regime, where the probability of monopoly is strictly between zero and one. Finally, we show that in the feedback-less case $\alpha=1$ no dominance occurs, that is, each bin gets a non-negligible proportion of balls eventually. This is in sharp contrast with a similar model where new balls added at time $n$ are all placed in the same bin rather than independently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study uniform rooted plane trees with given degree sequence. We show, under some natural hypotheses on the degree sequence, that these trees converge toward the so-called Inhomogeneous Continuum Random Tree after renormalisation. Our proof relies on the convergence of a modification of the well-known Lukasiewicz path. We also give a unified treatment of the limit, as the number of vertices tends to infinity, of the fragmentation process derived by cutting-down the edges of a tree with a given degree sequence, including its geometric representation by a lamination-valued process. The latter is a collection of nested laminations that are compact subsets of the unit disk made of non-crossing chords. In particular, we prove an equivalence between Gromov-weak convergence of discrete trees and the convergence of their associated lamination-valued processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic pseudomonotone parabolic obstacle problem: well-posedness $\&amp;$ Lewy-Stampacchia's inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider obstacle problems for nonlinear stochastic evolution equations. More precisely, the leading operator in our equation is a nonlinear, second order pseudomonotone operator of Leray-Lions type. The multiplicative noise term is given by a stochastic integral with respect to a Q-Wiener process. We show well-posedness of the associated initial value problem for random initial data on a bounded domain with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. First, we consider a singular perturbation of our problem by a higher order operator. Through the a priori estimates for the approximate solutions of the singular perturbation, only weak convergence is obtained. This convergence is not compatible with the nonlinearities in the equation. Therefore we use the theorems of Prokhorov and Skorokhod to establish existence of martingale solutions. Then, path-wise uniqueness follows from a L1-contraction principle and we may apply the method of Gy\"ongy-Krylov to obtain stochastically strong solutions. These well-posedness results serve as a basis for the study of variational inequalities and Lewy-Stampacchia's inequalities for our problem.</description>

      <title>Continuum asymptotics for tree growth models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the forward dynamics of all (plane) tree-valued Markov chains $(T_n,n \geq 1)$ with uniform backward dynamics. Every such Markov chain is classified by a weighted real tree, decorated with some additional functions. We also show that under an inhomogeneous rescaling after trimming leaves $(T_n, n\geq 1)$ converges to a random real tree in the Gromov--Prokhorov metric. This generalises and sheds some new light on work by Evans, Gr\"ubel and Wakolbinger (2017) on the binary special case.</description>

      <title>Modulus of continuity of Kerov transition measure for continual Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to the giant component fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to study the evolution of the size (i.e. the number of vertices) of the giant component of a random graph process. It is based on the exploration algorithm called simultaneous breadth-first walk, introduced by Limic in 2019, that encodes the dynamic of the evolution of the sizes of the connected components of a large class of random graph processes. We limit our study to the variant of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process $(G_n(s))_{s\geq 0}$ with $n$ vertices where an edge connecting a pair of vertices appears at an exponential rate 1 waiting time, independently over pairs. We first use the properties of the simultaneous breadth-first walk to obtain an alternative and self-contained proof of the functional central limit theorem recently established by Enriquez, Faraud and Lemaire in the super-critical regime ($s=\frac{c}{n}$ and $c&gt;1$). Next, to show the versatility of our approach, we prove a functional central limit theorem in the barely super-critical regime ($s=\frac{1+t\epsilon_n}{n}$ where $t&gt;0$ and $(\epsilon_n)_n$ is a sequence of positive reals that converges to 0 such that $(n\epsilon_n^3)_n$ tends to $+\infty$).</description>

      <title>Pathwise It\^o isometry for scaled quadratic variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of scaled quadratic variation was originally introduced by E. Gladyshev in 1961 in the context of Gaussian processes, where it was defined as the limit of the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process. In this paper, we extend this notion beyond the Gaussian framework for any real-valued continuous function by formulating it in a pathwise manner along a given sequence of partitions. We demonstrate that, for classical Gaussian processes such as fractional Brownian motion, this pathwise definition coincides with the traditional one up to a constant factor. Furthermore, we establish that the scaled quadratic variation is invariant under smooth transformations and satisfies a pathwise It\^o isometry-type result, derived without relying on any expectation arguments.</description>

      <title>Doob's type optional sampling theorems and a central limit theorem for demimartingales with applications to associated sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends classical probabilistic results to the broader class of demimartingales and demisubmartingales. We establish variants of Doob's-type optional sampling theorem under minimal structural conditions on stopping times, relying on monotonicity properties of indicator functions. Building on these foundations, we derive maximal inequalities, moment bounds, and a concentration inequality of Azuma- Hoeffding type for demimartingales with bounded increments. A central limit theorem and a strong law of large numbers are also obtained for demimartingales, demonstrating convergence under conditions considerably weaker than those required for martingales or independent sequences. These results are then applied to partial sums of positively associated random variables, yielding expectation bounds, concentration inequalities, and exponential bounds without requiring covariance decay or truncation arguments. The paper concludes with a strong law of large numbers for associated random variables, established under very mild conditions, highlighting the power of the demimartingale framework in handling dependence.</description>

      <title>Pinning models with contact number constraint: the effect of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16908v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an abstract, effective, exponential large deviations type estimate for Markov systems satisfying a weaker form of mixing. We employ this result to derive such estimates, as well as a central limit theorem, for the skew product encoding a random torus translation, a model we call a mixed random-quasiperiodic dynamical system. This abstract scheme is applicable to many other types of skew product dynamics, including systems for which the spectral gap property for the transition or the transfer operator does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture proposed by V. Delecroix, E. Goujard, P. Zograf, and A. Zorich, which describes the large genus asymptotic behaviours of the ratio of frequencies of separating over nonseparating simple closed geodesics on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ with $n$ cusps. We explicitly give the function $f(\frac{n}{g})$ in the conjecture. The moderate behaviour of the frequencies with respect to the growth rate of the number of cusps compared to that of the genus drastically contrasts with the behaviour of other geometric quantities and exhibits the topological nature of the frequencies.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the growth of positive harmonic functions, the strong Liouville property and the large scale geometry of finitely generated groups. We first show that the existence of one non-constant minimal harmonic function of slow (respectively, fast) growth rate guarantees that the space spanned by minimal harmonic functions of slow (respectively, fast) growth is infinite dimensional. We give a geometric-analytic characterisation for the strong Liouville property in terms of a functional involving the Green's function, which has immediate applications to groups with reasonable heat kernel bounds, including groups of polynomial as well as exponential growth. On the way, we show that under certain assumptions, strong Liouville property implies that the Green speed is zero.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>

      <title>Gr\"unbaum's inequality for Gaussian and convex probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. As an application, we apply the renowned Ehrhard inequality and deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.
  For $s$-concave Radon measures, our framework provides a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, yields the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality. Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function.</description>
