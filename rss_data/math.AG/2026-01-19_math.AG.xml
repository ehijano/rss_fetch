      <title>Maximal cross-ratio degree for 8 points in $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-ratio degree problem asks for the number of configurations of $n$ points in $\mathbb{P}^1$ that satisfy $n-3$ specified cross-ratio conditions. It is known that the maximal cross-ratio degree for 8 points is at least 4. In this paper, we will see that the maximal cross-ratio degree for 8 points in $\mathbb{P}^1$ is equal to 4.</description>

      <title>Interpolation matrices and jumping lines of logarithmic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study jumping lines loci of logarithmic bundles associated with finite sets of points in the projective plane. Using the interpolation matrix introduced in [DMTG25], we describe these loci as the zero sets of explicit determinants depending on parameters $(d,m)$ determined by the number of points. We show that for points in general position the determinant defines an irreducible curve of the expected degree, while for special configurations it acquires fixed components related to the combinatorics of the arrangement. The approach provides a new geometric interpretation of the classical jumping lines of Dolgachev--Kapranov and Barth, and connects them to the framework of unexpected curves and hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Positive Genus Pairs from Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix two integers $1\leq d&lt;e$. We study the birational geometry of a parameter space for pairs of homogeneous polynomials of degrees $d$ and $e$ in two variables (in which the higher degree polynomial is well defined only up to a multiple of the lower degree polynomial). We show that one can run the MMP on this space, and that it eventually contracts the resultant divisor.</description>

      <title>The rank-nullity ring of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the rank-nullity ring of a matroid $M$, which is a subring of the Chow ring of the permutahedral toric variety. This subring contains the tautological Chern classes of $M$, a fact we deduce from a highly symmetric formula for these classes. When the matroid $M$ is a uniform matroid, the rank-nullity ring coincides with the subring of $S_n$-invariants of the Chow ring of the permutahedral toric variety. In this case, we compute its Hilbert function explicitly and provide a Gr\"obner basis for the ideal of relations among its generators.</description>

      <title>Theta operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties at hyperspecial level. First we construct basic theta operators, labelled by positive roots, that generalize Katz's theta operator for modular forms. Secondly we construct theta linkage maps, these are operators between automorphic vector bundles with linked weights, which can be thought of as generalizations of the classical theta cycle of Tate--Jochnowitz. In particular, there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We explain the relation between the two operators, and we prove some properties about them, e.g., the injectivity of some of them in a generic locus of the $p$-restricted region. As an application, we produce an example of a generic entailment of Serre weights for the groups $GL_{4,\mathbb{Q}_p}$ and $U(4)_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, by combining the method of arxiv:2410.09602 with our stronger results about theta operators.</description>

      <title>A de Rham weight part of Serre's conjecture and generalized mod $p$ BGG decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of de Rham cohomology of special fibers of Shimura varieties to formulate a geometric version of
  the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We conjecture that this formulation is equivalent to the one using Serre weights and the \'etale cohomology of Shimura varieties.
  We prove this equivalence for generic weights and generic non-Eisenstein eigensystems for a compact $U(2,1)$ Shimura variety such that $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}=GL_3$. We do this by proving
  a generic concentration in middle degree of mod $p$ de Rham cohomology with coefficients.
  In turn, we prove this generic concentration by constructing generalized mod $p$ BGG decompositions for de Rham cohomology. After applying the results
  from our companion paper, this reduces to computing some BGG-like resolutions
  in a certain mod $p$ version of category $\mathcal{O}$, which is the main content
  of the article.
  In the $GSp_4$ case we also compute some explicit BGG decompositions, and assuming the generic concentration in middle degree of de Rham cohomology
  we obtain an improvement on the main result of arxiv:2410.09602.</description>

      <title>Nash uniformization of chessboard sets by Nash manifolds with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bierstone and Parusi\'nski studied the desingularization of $d$-dimensional closed subanalytic sets and in particular of $d$-dimensional closed semialgebraic sets. Their main tools are Hironaka's desingularization of real algebraic sets (to `uniform' the Zariski closure of the closed semialgebraic set) and Hironaka's embedded desingularization of real algebraic subsets of non-singular real algebraic sets (to uniform afterwards the Zariski closure of the boundary of the uniformed closed semialgebraic set).
  The obtained models in the desingularization process, that we call in the following closed chessboard sets, are the closures of (finite) unions of connected components of the complements of normal-crossings divisors of non-singular real algebraic sets. The local models for $d$-dimensional chessboard sets are unions of (standard) closed orthants of ${\mathbb R}^d$, that is, $\bigcup_{(\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_d)\in{\mathfrak F}}\{\varepsilon_1{\tt x}_1\geq0,\ldots,\varepsilon_d{\tt x}_d\geq0\}\subset{\mathbb R}^d$ for some set ${\mathfrak F}\subset\{-1,1\}^d$.
  We study the Nash uniformization of $d$-dimensional closed chessboard sets ${\mathcal S}$ using Nash manifolds with corners ${\mathcal Q}$ with the same number of connected components as ${\mathcal S}$ (or equivalently the same number of irreducible components). Nash manifolds with corners are closed chessboard set whose local models are either ${\mathbb R}^d$ or semialgebraic sets of the type $\{{\tt x}_1\geq0,\ldots,{\tt x}_k\geq0\}$ for some $1\leq k\leq d$. More generally, a chessboard set is a semialgebraic set in between a finite union of connected components of the complement of a normal-crossings divisor of non-singular real algebraic set and its closure. We also provide a Nash uniformization result for general chessboard sets ${\mathcal S}$.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Broken Line Convex Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the fundamentals of a new theory of convex geometry -- which we call "broken line convex geometry". This is a theory of convexity where the ambient space is the rational tropicalization of a cluster variety, as opposed to an ambient vector space. In this theory, line segments are replaced by broken line segments, and we adopt the notion of convexity in [CMN21]. We state and prove broken line convex geometry versions of many standard results from usual convex geometry.</description>

Abstract: We formulate and prove a non-abelian analog of Deligne's Fixed Part theorem on Hodge classes, revisiting previous work of Jost--Zuo, Katzarkov--Pantev and Landesman--Litt. To this aim we study algebraically isomonodromic extensions of local systems and we relate them to variations of Hodge structures, for example we show that the Mumford-Tate group at a generic point stays constant in an algebraically isomonodromic extension of a variation of Hodge structure. v2: a few typos ironed and Thm 1.1 5) completed. v3: there was a Schlamassel leading to a mix-up of files. Apologies. Else identical version (one minor change). v5 final version. Appears in Alg. Geom.</description>

Abstract: This is the final paper in the series of five, in which we prove the geometric Langlands conjecture (GLC). We conclude the proof of GLC by showing that there exists a unique (up to tensoring up by a vector space) Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to an irreducible local system (hence, the title of the paper). We achieve this by analyzing the geometry of the stack of local systems.</description>

      <title>An explicit derived McKay correspondence for some complex reflection groups of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the derived McKay correspondence for several reflection groups, namely reflection groups of rank two generated by reflections of order two. We prove that for each of the reflection groups $G=G(2m,m,2)$, $G_{12}$, $G_{13}$, or $G_{22}$, there is a semiorthogonal decomposition of the following form, where $B_1,\ldots,B_r$ are the normalizations of the irreducible components of the branch divisor $\mathbb{C}^2\to \mathbb{C}^2/G$ and $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ are exceptional objects: $$D^G(\mathbb{C}^2)\cong \langle E_1,\ldots,E_n,D(B_1),\ldots, D(B_r), D(\mathbb{C}^2/G)\rangle.$$ We verify that the pieces of this decomposition correspond to the irreducible representations of $G$, verifying the Orbifold Semiorthogonal Decomposition Conjecture of Polishchuk and Van den Bergh. Due to work of Potter on the group $G(m,m,2)$, this conjecture is now proven for all finite groups $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ that are generated by order $2$ reflections. Each of these groups contains, as a subgroup of index $2$, a distinct finite group $H\leq \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. A key part of our work is an explicit computation of the action of $G/H$ on the $H$-Hilbert scheme $\textrm{$H$-Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We present a new probabilistic algorithm that characterizes the equidimensional components of the affine algebraic variety defined by an arbitrary sparse polynomial system with prescribed supports. For each equidimensional component, the algorithm computes a witness set, namely a finite set obtained by intersecting the component with a generic linear variety of complementary dimension. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in combinatorial invariants associated to the supports of the polynomials involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce horizontal and vertical motivic invariants of birational maps between rational dominant maps and study their basic properties. As a first application, we show that the (usual) motivic invariants vanish for birational automorphisms of threefolds over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. On the other hand, we prove that the motivic invariants of the birational automorphism group of many types of varieties, including projective spaces of dimension at least four over a field of characteristic zero, do not form a bounded family, even after extending scalars to the algebraic closure of the field. For such varieties, we further show that their birational automorphism groups are not generated by maps preserving a conic bundle or a rational surface fibration structure, and their abelianizations do not stabilize.</description>

      <title>Variations on cohomology rings and zero schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theorem of Hausel and the author from arXiv:2212.11836 that relates equivariant cohomology rings and algebras of functions on zero schemes. This paper combines three separate results. We prove that for a reductive group G acting on a smooth projective variety one can see the equivariant cohomology ring as the ring of functions on the zero scheme over the Kostant section, provided that some transversality condition is satisfied. In particular, we show that the conclusion holds for spherical varieties. We then show a version for singular varieties, e.g. discriminant varieties, where in general we only recover a part of equivariant cohomology ring, generated by Chern classes. We also show that an analogous result, connecting equivariant K-theory to the ring of functions on the fixed-point scheme, holds for GKM spaces.
  This is a concise version of some results from the PhD thesis arXiv:2407.14659, which contains a broader introduction to the topic.</description>

      <title>Defect of projective hypersurfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a hypersurface with isolated singularities defined by $f$ in ${\bf P^{n+1}}$ with $n&gt;1$. The difference ${\rm def}(X):=h^{n+1}(X)-h^{n-1}(X)$ is called the defect of $X$ (for self-duality of the cohomology of $X$). It is known that its vanishing is closely related to ${\bf Q}$-factoriality of $X$ in the rational singularity case with $n=3$. This number coincides with the dimension of the cokernel of the inclusion $H^{n-1}(X)\to{\rm IH}^{n-1}(X)$, the rank of the morphism from the vanishing cohomologies of $X$ to $H^{n+1}(X)$ for a one-parameter smoothing of $X$ with total space smooth, and also with the dimension of the unipotent monodromy part of the Milnor fiber cohomology of $f$ with degree $n$. In the case $X$ has only weighted homogeneous isolated singularities, the defect ${\rm def}(X)$ is then given by the $E_2$-term of the spectral sequence of the double complex with differentials ${\rm d}f\wedge$ and $\rm d$ by the $E_2$-degeneration of the pole order spectral sequence. It can be calculated explicitly using a computer even for analogues of the Hirzebruch quintic threefold with more than one hundred ordinary double points found by B.\ van Geemen and J.\ Werner in a compatible way with their computation. We give also an example with ${\rm def}(X)&gt;0$ and $|{\rm Sing}\,X|=1$ where $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Scheme-theoretic coisotropic reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an affine scheme-theoretic version of Hamiltonian reduction by symplectic groupoids. It works over $\Bbbk=\mathbb{R}$ or $\Bbbk=\mathbb{C}$, and is formulated for an affine symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G}\rightrightarrows X$, an affine Hamiltonian $\mathcal{G}$-scheme $\mu:M\longrightarrow X$, a coisotropic subvariety $S\subseteq X$, and a stabilizer subgroupoid $\mathcal{H}\rightrightarrows S$. Our first main result is that the Poisson bracket on $\Bbbk[M]$ induces a Poisson bracket on the subquotient $\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}}$. The Poisson scheme $\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}})$ is then declared to be a Hamiltonian reduction of $M$. Other main results include sufficient conditions for $\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}})$ to inherit a residual Hamiltonian scheme structure.
  Our main results are best viewed as affine scheme-theoretic counterparts to an earlier paper, where we simultaneously generalize several Hamiltonian reduction processes. In this way, the present work yields scheme-theoretic analogues of Marsden-Ratiu reduction, Mikami-Weinstein reduction, \'{S}niatycki-Weinstein reduction, and symplectic reduction along general coisotropic submanifolds. The initial impetus for this work was its utility in formulating and proving generalizations of the Moore-Tachikawa conjecture.</description>

      <title>Theta operators and a generic entailment for $GSp_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on the Siegel threefold. In particular, we construct one operator which generalizes the classical theta cycle, whose weight shift allows for maps between $p$-restricted weights, and which is generically injective on global sections. As an application we produce a generic entailment of Serre weights, i.e. any Hecke eigenform which is modular for a generic Serre weight in the lowest alcove is also modular for a Serre weight in one of the upper alcoves. The entailed Serre weight corresponds to a shadow weight of the lowest alcove Serre weight,

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, under some mild conditions on $\vec{q}$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a perfectoid analogue of the Ax-Kochen theorem on zeros of $p$-adic forms: Given $d\in \mathbb{N}$, there is a finite totally ramified extension $E/\mathbb{Q}_p$ such that every untilt of $\mathbb{F}_p(\!(t^{1/p^{\infty}})\!)$ containing $E$ is $C_2(d)$. We also prove a similar result for the existence of rational points in rationally connected varieties over perfectoid field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p^{ur}$.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantisation of exact shifted symplectic structures, with an application to vanishing cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the author's and CPTVV's correspondence between shifted symplectic and Poisson structures to establish a correspondence between exact shifted symplectic structures and non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation, a concept generalising constructions by De Wilde and Lecomte. Our formulation is sufficiently general to encompass derived algebraic, analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ stacks, as well as Lagrangians and non-commutative generalisations. We also show that non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation carry unique self-dual deformation quantisations in any setting where the latter can be formulated.
  One application is that for (not necessarily exact) $0$-shifted symplectic structures in analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ settings, it follows that the author's earlier parametrisations of quantisations are in fact independent of any choice of associator, and generalise Fedosov's parametrisation of quantisations for classical manifolds.
  Our main application is to complex $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures, showing that our unique quantisation of the canonical exact structure, a sheaf of twisted $BD_0$-algebras with derivation, gives rise to BBDJS's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, equipped with its monodromy operator.</description>
