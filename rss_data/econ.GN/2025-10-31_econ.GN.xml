      <title>Short-Run Multi-Outcome Effects of Nightlife Regulation in San Juan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I evaluate San Juan, Puerto Rico's late-night alcohol sales ordinance using a multi-outcome synthetic control that pools economic and public-safety series. I show that a common-weight estimator clarifies mechanisms under low-rank outcome structure. I find economically meaningful reallocations in targeted sectors -- restaurants and bars, gasoline and convenience, and hospitality employment -- while late-night public disorder arrests and violent crime show no clear departures from pre-policy trends. The short post-policy window and small donor pool limit statistical power; joint conformal and permutation tests do not reject the null at conventional thresholds. I therefore emphasize effect magnitudes, temporal persistence, and pre-trend fit over formal significance. Code and diagnostics are available for replication.</description>

      <title>World personal income distribution evolution measured by purchasing power parity exchange rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of global income distribution from 1988 to 2018 is analyzed using purchasing power parity exchange rates and well-established statistical distributions. This research proposes the use of two separate distributions to more accurately represent the overall data, rather than relying on a single distribution. The global income distribution was fitted to log-normal and gamma functions, which are standard tools in econophysics. Despite limitations in data completeness during the early years, the available information covered the vast majority of the world's population. Probability density function (PDF) curves enabled the identification of key peaks in the distribution, while complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves highlighted general trends in inequality. Initially, the global income distribution exhibited a bimodal pattern; however, the growth of middle classes in highly populated countries such as China and India has driven the transition to a unimodal distribution in recent years. While single-function fits with gamma or log-normal distributions provided reasonable accuracy, the bimodal approach constructed as a sum of log-normal distributions yielded near-perfect fits.</description>

      <title>The sustainability of contribution norms with income dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainability of cooperation is crucial for understanding the progress of societies. We study a repeated game in which individuals decide the share of their income to transfer to other group members. A central feature of our model is that individuals may, with some probability, switch incomes across periods, our measure of income mobility, while the overall income distribution remains constant over time. We analyze how income mobility and income inequality affect the sustainability of contribution norms, informal agreements about how much each member should transfer to the group. We find that greater income mobility facilitates cooperation. In contrast, the effect of inequality is ambiguous and depends on the progressivity of the contribution norm and the degree of mobility. We apply our framework to an optimal taxation problem to examine the interaction between public and private redistribution.</description>

      <title>Putting a Price on Immobility: Food Deliveries and Pricing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban food delivery services have become an integral part of daily life, yet their mobility and environmental externalities remain poorly addressed by planners. Most studies neglect whether consumers pay enough to internalize the broader social costs of these services. This study quantifies the value of access to and use of food delivery services in Beijing, China, through two discrete choice experiments. The first measures willingness to accept compensation for giving up access, with a median value of CNY588 (approximately USD80). The second captures willingness to pay for reduced waiting time and improved reliability, showing valuations far exceeding typical delivery fees (e.g., CNY96.6/hour and CNY4.83/min at work). These results suggest a substantial consumer surplus and a clear underpricing problem. These findings highlight the need for urban planning to integrate digital service economies into pricing and mobility frameworks. We propose a quantity-based pricing model that targets delivery speed rather than order volume, addressing the primary source of externalities while maintaining net welfare gains. This approach offers a pragmatic, equity-conscious strategy to curb delivery-related congestion, emissions, and safety risks, especially in dense urban cores.</description>

      <title>Neither Consent nor Property: A Policy Lab for Data Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes the opaque data market in the AI economy empirically legible for the first time, constructing a computational testbed to address a core epistemic failure: regulators governing a market defined by structural opacity, fragile price discovery, and brittle technical safeguards that have paralyzed traditional empirics and fragmented policy. The pipeline begins with multi-year fieldwork to extract the market's hidden logic, and then embeds these grounded behaviors into a high-fidelity ABM, parameterized via a novel LLM-based discrete-choice experiment that captures the preferences of unsurveyable populations. The pipeline is validated against reality, reproducing observed trade patterns. This policy laboratory delivers clear, counter-intuitive results. First, property-style relief is a false promise: ''anonymous-data'' carve-outs expand trade but ignore risk, causing aggregate welfare to collapse once external harms are priced in. Second, social welfare peaks when the downstream buyer internalizes the full substantive risk. This least-cost avoider approach induces efficient safeguards, simultaneously raising welfare and sustaining trade, and provides a robust empirical foundation for the legal drift toward two-sided reachability. The contribution is a reproducible pipeline designed to end the reliance on intuition. It converts qualitative insight into testable, comparative policy experiments, obsoleting armchair conjecture by replacing it with controlled evidence on how legal rules actually shift risk and surplus. This is the forward-looking engine that moves the field from competing intuitions to direct, computational analysis.</description>

      <title>Budget Forecasting and Integrated Strategic Planning for Leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explored how advanced budgeting techniques and economic indicators influence funding levels and strategic alignment in California Community Colleges (CCCs). Despite widespread implementation of budgeting reforms, many CCCs continue to face challenges aligning financial planning with institutional missions, particularly in supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The study used a quantitative correlational design, analyzing 30 years of publicly available economic data, including unemployment rates, GDP growth, and CPI, in relation to CCC funding trends. Results revealed a strong positive correlation between GDP growth and CCC funding levels, as well as between CPI and funding levels, underscoring the predictive value of macroeconomic indicators in budget planning. These findings emphasize the need for educational leaders to integrate economic forecasting into budget planning processes to safeguard institutional effectiveness and sustain programs serving underrepresented student populations.</description>

      <title>AI's Social Forcefield: Reshaping Distributed Cognition in Human-AI Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is not only a neutral tool in team settings; it actively reshapes the social and cognitive fabric of collaboration. We advance a unified framework of alignment in distributed cognition in human-AI teams -- a process through which linguistic, cognitive, and social coordination emerge as human and AI agents co-construct a shared representational space. Across two studies, we show that exposure to AI-generated language shapes not only how people speak, but also how they think, what they attend to, and how they relate to each other. Together, these findings reveal how AI participation reorganizes the distributed cognitive architecture of teams: AI systems function as implicit social forcefields. Our findings highlight the double-edged impact of AI: the same mechanisms that enable efficient collaboration can also erode epistemic diversity and undermine natural alignment processes. We argue for rethinking AI in teams as a socially influential actor and call for new design paradigms that foreground transparency, controllability, and group-level dynamics to foster responsible, productive human-AI collaboration.</description>
