      <title>On a recent explanation of the dynamics of the Meissner effect within the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. [1], arXiv:2511.03384, Markos and Hlubina argue that "contrary to the expectations of Hirsch" [2] the conventional theory of superconductivity correctly describes the dynamics of the Meissner effect. Here I point out the flaws in their arguments that render them invalid, and propose an experiment to shed further light on these issues.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in YRu3B2 and LuRu3B2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Chronicle: "Foot of the iceberg" of Nobel Prize in Physics 2025: ILTPE and LTP contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 has been awarded to John Clarke, John Martinis, and Michel Devoret for "the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit". The paper explains the essence of their studies and shows in a historical context the importance of earlier research in superconductivity and quantum physics of macroscopic systems by other physicists, particularly, Ukrainian scientists, including employees of the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the NAS of Ukraine (ILTPE). The role of the Fizyka Nyzkykh Temperatur (FNT) journal issued by ILTPE in Kharkiv and its translation as AIP Low Temperature Physics (LTP) in dissemination of results of the theoretical and experimental studies in the field is emphasized as well.</description>

      <title>Driving the field-free Josephson diode effect using Kagome Mott insulator barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.</description>

      <title>Probing the intermediate state of type-I superconductor SnAs using Muon Spin Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity with non-trivial band topology provides a novel platform for exploring topological superconductivity and its quantum applications. A detailed microscopic understanding of the superconducting ground state in such materials is crucial. Here, we report the results of a muon spin rotation/relaxation study ($\mu$SR) of the topologically non-trivial superconductor SnAs, which exhibits superconductivity below 3.74(1) \si{K}. Zero-field (ZF) $\mu$SR data reveal that this system is a time-reversal invariant superconductor, and systematic transverse-field (TF) $\mu$SR measurements unveil the type-I nature of the SnAs superconductor. We have established the superconducting phase diagram to understand the intermediate state of type-I superconductors. Moreover, ab \textit{initio} band structure and phonon calculations are performed, which correlate with the experimental characterization.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic evidence for full-gap superconductivity in the dodecagonal quasicrystal Cu-doped Ta$_{1.6}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the superconducting gap in the van der Waals layered quasicrystal Cu-doped Ta$_{1.6}$Te, using a fast relaxation technique that removes the large nuclear contribution of $^{181}$Ta.
  The initial-slope method enabled detection of the electronic specific heat down to 60~mK, revealing a fully gapped state with $\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B} = 1.43$~K.
  Both the gap magnitude and specific-heat jump are smaller than BCS predictions, while quasiparticle excitations are strongly suppressed, consistent with a theoretical expectation for aperiodic systems.
  AC-susceptibility measurements show a large upper critical field and pronounced anisotropy, reflecting the quasi-two-dimensional structure.
  These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence for a full-gap superconducting state in a quasicrystal and highlight unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond periodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the electronic properties and multiorbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films on SrLaAlO$_4$ (001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films raises a fundamental question: is the metallic ground state driven by lattice strain or interfacial charge reconstruction? Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $\gamma$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</description>

      <title>Bulk signatures of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from ultrasound measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report bulk ultrasound measurements up to 80 T and down to 0.5 K of the field re-entrant superconducting phase of the unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$. Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $\theta_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $\theta_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Proximity effect in asymmetric-gap superconducting bilayers and regularization of transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating Superfluids: The Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</description>

      <title>Chiral topological superconductivity in twisted bilayer and double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moir\'e Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moir\'e band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moir\'e materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.</description>

      <title>Comparative Raman study of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and the monolayer-trilayer polymorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have attracted intense interest following the discovery of superconductivity in several members of the series, including bilayer (BL) La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, trilayer (TL) La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and structural polymorphs composed of monolayer-bilayer or monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) units. However, an inherent propensity of the RP series to form intergrown phases during single-crystal synthesis, together with spatial variations in oxygen stoichiometry, has complicated the determination of their intrinsic material properties. As a consequence, conflicting reports have emerged on both their electronic phase transitions and lattice dynamics. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the phononic and electronic Raman responses of high-quality ML-TL single crystals and contrast them with those of other RP nickelates, using samples with optimized oxygen content. We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series. Moreover, we uncover characteristics in the phononic and electronic Raman response of ML-TL that are not reflected in the pure ML and TL compounds. We attribute these differences to a distinctive electronic structure arising from self-doping and confinement effects induced by the ML unit within the ML-TL lattice architecture.</description>

      <title>Charge fluctuations and topological phases in Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological phases in doped Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders by studying the competition with itinerant electrons and the associated charge fluctuations in a Hubbard model on a honeycomb ribbon geometry. We analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band. Our results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram. We identify the critical values of hopping where string order vanishes and characterize the interplay between magnetic order and charge fluctuations. These findings provide insight into the robustness of topological phases against doping and charge dynamics, with implications for candidate Kitaev materials and engineered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized topological d+id superconductivity in the Yao-Lee-Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conclusive experimental realization of 2D chiral topological superconductivity remains elusive. Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*).</description>

      <title>Interplay of Defects and the Charge Density Wave State in Hf-Doped ZrTe$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out temperature-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of the charge density wave (CDW) compound ZrTe$_3$ which is intentionally doped with Hf. Previous bulk studies tie Hf doping to an enhancement of the CDW transition temperature (T$_{CDW}$). In our work, by combining STM measurements with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we observe and identify multiple defects in Zr$_{0.95}$Hf$_{0.05}$Te$_3$. Surprisingly, instead of finding clear structural or electronic signatures associated with Hf dopants, we determine the origin of the observed defects are consistent with Te and Zr vacancies. Further, our temperature dependent STM measurements allow us to examine CDW pinning to both types of observed defects below and above T$_{CDW}$.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of lattice and charge order excitations in a superconducting cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ubiquitous tendency of superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves (CDWs) has reignited interest in the nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their phase diagrams. While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Geometric Superfluid Weight in Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric contribution to the superfluidity in quasicrystals in which the conventional momentum-space quantum geometric tensor cannot be defined due to the lack of translational invariance. Based on the correspondence between the momentum and magnetic flux, we introduce the flux-space quantum metric in finite-size closed systems and reveal its contribution to the superfluid weight in quasicrystalline superconductors. As a toy model, we study the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci quasiperiodic stub lattices that host flat energy spectra even in the presence of quasiperiodic hoppings. In the weak-coupling limit, we establish the relation between superfluid weight and the flux-space quantum metric in quasicrystal superconductors with flat energy spectra. Moreover, by analyzing the spread of Wannier functions, we propose a general fluctuation mechanism that explains how quasiperiodicity modulates the integrated flux-space quantum metric. Our theory provides a general way to examine the effect of the quantum geometry in systems lacking translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</description>
