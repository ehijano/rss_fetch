      <title>Existence for a Nonlocal Multi-Species Advection Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish short-time existence of bounded, smooth non-negative solutions to a multi-species advection diffusion equation for a wide class of singular interaction kernels. We also give conditions on the interaction matrix, whose coefficients determine species attraction or repulsion, which ensure global existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and minimal interfaces on manifolds with conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using $\Gamma$-convergence, we study the Cahn-Hilliard problem with interface width parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for phase transitions on manifolds with conical singularities. We prove that minimizers of the corresponding energy functional exist and converge, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, to a function that takes only two values with an interface along a hypersurface that has minimal area among those satisfying a volume constraint. In a numerical example, we use continuation and bifurcation methods to study families of critical points at small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ on 2D elliptical cones, parameterized by height and ellipticity of the base. Some of these critical points are minimizers with interfaces crossing the cone tip. On the other hand, we prove that interfaces which are minimizers of the perimeter functional, corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$, never pass through the cone tip for general cones with angle less than $2\pi$. Thus tip minimizers for finite $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ must become saddles as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and we numerically identify the associated bifurcation, finding a delicate interplay of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and the cone parameters in our example.</description>

      <title>Asmptotic properties of the Stokes flow in an exterior domain with slowly decaying initial data and its application to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the decay rate of the Stokes flow in an exterior domain with a slowly decaying initial data ${\bf u}_0(x)=O(|x|^{-\al}), 0&lt;\al\leq n$. %which is not $L^1$ integrable. As an application we find the unique strong solution of the Navier-Stokes equations corresponding to a slowly decaying initial data. We also derive the pointwise decay estimate of the Navier-Stokes flow. Our decay rates will be optimal compared with the decay rates of the heat flow.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of pointwise convegence for the Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb R^n$ along time sequences. We show that the sharp counterexample to the sequential Schr\"odinger maximal estimate given recently by Li, Wang and Yan based in the construction by Luc\`a and Rogers can also be achieved with the construction of Bourgain, and we extend it to the fractal setting.</description>

      <title>Stability and Sharp Decay Estimates for 3D MHD Equations with Only Vertical Dissipation Near a Background Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the stability and large-time behavior of 3D incompressible MHD equations with only vertical dissipation near a background magnetic field. By making full use of the dissipation generated by the background magnetic field, we first establish the global stability of the solutions in $H^3$-norm. Then, the optimal decay rates of the solutions are obtained, which are consistent with the 2D classical heat equation. Moreover, some enhanced decay rates of $(u_1,b_1)$ are also achieved. In other words, the decay estimates of the second or third component of velocity/magnetic field coincide with those of 2D heat kernel, while the first component behaves like the 3D heat kernel. This is mainly due to the divergence-free condition and the anisotropic structure. The results obtained improve the previous ones due to Lin-Wu-Zhu [24,25].</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse time-harmonic scattering by Dirichlet periodic curves with local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the authors' previous work (A. Kirsch, Math. Meth. Appl. Sci., 45 (2022): 5737-5773.) on well-posedness of time-harmonic scattering by locally perturbed periodic curves of Dirichlet kind. The scattering interface is supposed to be given by a non-self-intersecting Lipschitz curve. We study properties of the Green's function and prove new well-posedness results for scattering of plane waves at a propagative wave number. In such a case there exist guided waves to the unperturbed problem, which are also known as Bounded States in the Continuity (BICs) in physics. In this paper uniqueness of the forward scattering follows from an orthogonal constraint condition enforcing on the total field to the unperturbed scattering problem. This constraint condition, which is also valid under the Neumann boundary condition, is derived from the singular perturbation arguments and also from the approach of approximating a plane wave by point source waves. For the inverse problem of determining the defect, we prove several uniqueness results using a finite or infinite number of point source and plane waves, depending on whether a priori information on the size and height of the defect is available.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of energy for N-body Schr\"odinger equations with time dependent small potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Sobolev norms of solutions to time dependent Schr\"odinger equations for $d$-dimensional $N$-partcles interacting via time dependent two body potentials are bounded in time if certain Lebesgue norms of the potentials are small uniformly in time. The proof uses the scattering theory in the extended phase space which proves that all particles scatter freely in the remote past and far future.</description>

      <title>Frequency-explicit stability estimates for time-harmonic elastodynamic problems in nearly incompressible materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic elastodynamic problems in heterogeneous media.cWe focus on scattering problems in the high-frequency regime and incnearly incompressible media, where the the angular frequency $\omega$ and ratio of the Lam\'e parameters $\lambda/\mu$ may both be large. We derive stability estimates controlling the norm of the solution by the norm of the right-hand side up to a fully-explicit constant. Crucially, under natural assumptions on the domain and coefficients, this constant increases linearly with $\omega$ and is uniform in the ratio $\lambda/\mu$.</description>

      <title>The fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation on lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*}
  i \partial_t u + {\Delta}^2 u - \gamma \Delta u = \pm |u|^{s-1}u \end{equation*} on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with dimensions $d=1,2$ and parameter $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$. In order to establish sharp dispersive estimates, we consider the fundamental solution as an oscillatory integral and analyze the Newton polyhedron of its phase function. Furthermore, we prove Strichartz estimates which yield the existence of global solutions to nonlinear equations with small data.</description>

      <title>Short time asymptotics of the fundamental solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger equations with non-smooth potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with Schr\"{o}dinger equations with potentials which are time-dependent non-smooth and at most quadratic growth. In the case where potentials are smooth with respect to spatial variables, fundamental solutions have explicit formulas in short time by D. Fujiwara. On the otherhand in the case where ones are non-smooth, we cannot expect that fundamental solutions have similar formula as above because dispersive estimates fail to hold in general. We show that a principal part of an asymptotic form of the fundamental solution has similar form as above even in the case where a potential is in $C^2$ with respect to spatial variables.</description>

      <title>Existence of Weak Solutions to a Cahn-Hilliard-Biot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of weak solutions to a diffuse interface model describing the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases. The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the evolution of the solid, and is further augmented by a visco-elastic regularization consistent with secondary consolidation. To obtain this result, we approximate the problem in two steps, where first a semi-Galerkin ansatz is employed to show existence of weak solutions to regularized systems, for which later on compactness arguments allow limit passage. Notably, we also establish a maximal regularity theory for linear visco-elastic problems.</description>

      <title>Stability of Stationary Solutions to the Nonisentropic Euler-Poisson System in a Perturbed Half Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main concern of this paper is to mathematically investigate the formation of a plasma sheath near the surface of nonplanar walls. We study the existence and asymptotic stability of stationary solutions for the nonisentropic Euler-Poisson equations in a domain of which boundary is drawn by a graph, by employing a space weighted energy method. Moreover, the convergence rate of the solution toward the stationary solution is obtained, provided that the initial perturbation belongs to the weighted Sobolev space. Because the domain is the perturbed half space, we first show the time-global solvability of the nonisentropic Euler-Poisson equations, then construct stationary solutions by using the time-global solutions.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing bubbling solutions for an exponential nonlinearity in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quite differently from those perturbation techniques in \cite{DM}, we use the assumption of a $C^1$-stable critical point to construct positive or sign-changing bubbling solutions to the boundary value problem $-\Delta u=\lambda u|u|^{p-2}e^{|u|^p}$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition in a bounded, smooth planar domain $\Omega$, when $0&lt;p&lt;2$ and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a small parameter. A sufficient condition on the intersection between the nodal line of these sign-changing solutions and the boundary of the domain is founded. Moreover, for $\lambda$ small enough, we prove that when $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain, this problem has not only at least two pairs of bubbling solutions which change sign exactly once and whose nodal lines intersect the boundary, but also a bubbling solution which changes sign exactly twice or three times; when $\Omega$ has an axial symmetry, this problem has a bubbling solution which alternately changes sign arbitrarily many times along the axis of symmetry through the domain.</description>

      <title>Quantitative 2D propagation of smallness and control for 1D heat equations with power growth potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between propagation of smallness in the plane and control for heat equations. The former has been proved by Zhu who showed how the value of solutions in some small set propagates to a larger domain. By reviewing his proof, we establish a quantitative version with the explicit dependence of parameters. Using this explicit version, we establish new exact null-controllability results of 1D heat equations with any nonnegative power growth potentials $V\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$. As a key ingredient, new spectral inequalities are established. The control set $\Omega$ that we consider satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \left|\Omega\cap [x-L\langle x\rangle ^{-s},x+L\langle x\rangle ^{-s}]\right|\ge \gamma^{\langle x\rangle^\tau}2L\langle x\rangle^{-s} \end{equation*} for some $\gamma\in(0,1)$, $L&gt;0$, $\tau,s\ge 0$, and $\langle x\rangle:=(1+|x|^2)^{1 /2} $. In particular, the null-controllability result for the case of thick sets that allow the decay of the density (\textit{i.e.}, $s=0$ and $\tau\ge 0$) is included. These extend the Zhu-Zhuge's results from $\Omega$ being the union of equidistributive open sets to thick sets in the 1-dimensional case, and Su-Sun-Yuan's result from bounded potentials to certain unbounded ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, we discuss the relation between the solvability of Schiffer's overdetermined problem and the optimality, among sets of prescribed area, of the first eigenvalue in the buckling problem for a clamped plate and that of the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator. For the latter, we deduce that the minimisers under area constraint that are smooth and simply connected must be discs from the fact that a pressureless velocity is a necessary condition of optimality.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates in almost periodic homogenization of parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of second-order parabolic operators $\partial_t+\mathcal{L}_\varepsilon$ in divergence form with rapidly oscillating, time-dependent and almost-periodic coefficients. We establish uniform interior and boundary H\"older and Lipschitz estimates as well as convergence rate. The estimates of fundamental solution and Green's function are also established. In contrast to periodic case, the main difficulty is that the corrector equation $
(\partial_s+\mathcal{L}_1)(\chi^\beta_{j})=-\mathcal{L}_1(P^\beta_j) $ in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ may not be solvable in the almost periodic setting for linear functions $P(y)$ and $\partial_t \chi_S$ may not in $B^2(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})$. Our results are new even in the case of time-independent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Stokes equation with relaxation on the divergence free equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new nonlocal approximation to the linear Stokes system with periodic boundary conditions in two and three dimensional spaces . A relaxation term is added to the equation of nonlocal divergence free equation, which is reminiscent to the relaxation of local Stokes equation with small artificial compressibility. Our analysis shows that the well-posedness of the nonlocal system can be established under some mild assumptions on the kernel of nonlocal interactions. Furthermore, the new nonlocal system converges to the conventional, local Stokes system in second order as the horizon parameter of the nonlocal interaction goes to zero. The study provides more theoretical understanding to some numerical methods, such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for simulating incompressible viscous flows.</description>

      <title>Finite time BV blowup for Liu-admissible solutions to $p$-system via computer-assisted proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite time blowup of the $BV$-norm for exact solutions to genuinely nonlinear hyperbolic systems in one space dimension, in particular the $p$-system. We consider solutions verifying shock admissibility criteria such as the Lax E-condition and the Liu E-condition. In particular, we present Riemann initial data which admits infinitely many bounded solutions, each of which experience, not just finite time, but in fact instantaneous blowup of the $BV$ norm. The Riemann initial data is allowed to come from an open set in state space. Our method provably does not admit a strictly convex entropy.
  The main results in this article compare to Jenssen [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 31(4):894--908, 2000], who shows $BV$ blowup for bounded solutions, or alternatively, blowup in $L^\infty$, for an artificial $3\times 3$ system which is not genuinely nonlinear. Baiti-Jenssen [Discrete Contin. Dynam. Systems, 7(4):837--853, 2001] improves upon this Jenssen result and can consider a genuinely nonlinear system, but then the blowup is only in $L^\infty$ and they cannot construct bounded solutions which blowup in $BV$. Moreover, their system is non-physical and provably does not admit a global, strictly convex entropy. Our result also shows sharpness of the recent Bressan-De Lellis result [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 247(6):Paper No. 106, 12, 2023] concerning well-posedness via the Liu E-condition. The proof of our theorem is computer-assisted, following the framework of Sz\'{e}kelyhidi [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 172(1):133--152, 2004]. Our code is available on the GitHub.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Favorable Falkner-Skan Profiles for the Stationary Prandtl Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (favorable) Falkner-Skan boundary layer profiles are a one parameter ($\beta \in [0,2]$) family of self-similar solutions to the stationary Prandtl system which describes the flow over a wedge with angle $\beta \frac{\pi}{2}$. The most famous member of this family is the endpoint Blasius profile, $\beta = 0$, which exhibits pressureless flow over a flat plate. In contrast, the $\beta &gt; 0$ profiles are physically expected to exhibit a \textit{favorable pressure gradient}, a common adage in the physics literature. In this work, we prove quantitative scattering estimates as $x \rightarrow \infty$ which precisely captures the effect of this favorable gradient through the presence of new ``CK" (Cauchy-Kovalevskaya) terms that appear in a quasilinear energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for nonlocal elliptic equations and free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we establish for the first time the $C^s$ boundary regularity of solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations with kernels $K(y)\asymp |y|^{-n-2s}$. This was known to hold only when $K$ is homogeneous, and it is quite surprising that it holds for general inhomogeneous kernels, too. As an application of our results, we also establish the optimal $C^{1+s}$ regularity of solutions to obstacle problems for general nonlocal operators with kernels $K(y)\asymp |y|^{-n-2s}$. Again, this was only known when $K$ is homogeneous, and it solves a long-standing open question in the field. A new key idea is to construct a 1D solution as a minimizer of an appropriate nonlocal one-phase free boundary problem, for which we establish optimal $C^s$ regularity and non-degeneracy estimates.</description>

      <title>Variational structures for the Fokker--Planck equation with general Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of a modified Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto scheme to a solution to the Fokker--Planck equation in $\Omega \Subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with spatially nonconstant Dirichlet boundary conditions. We work under mild assumptions on the domain, on the drift, and on the initial datum. In the special case where $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we prove that such a solution is a gradient flow -- curve of maximal slope -- within a suitable space of measures, endowed with a modified Wasserstein distance. Our discrete scheme and modified distance draw inspiration from contributions by A. Figalli and N. Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107--130], and J. Morales [J. Math. Pures Appl. 112, (2018), pp. 41--88] on an optimal-transport approach to evolution equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the One-dimensional Singular Abreu Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular fourth-order Abreu equations have been used to approximate minimizers of convex functionals subject to a convexity constraint in dimensions higher than or equal to two. For Abreu type equations, they often exhibit different solvability phenomena in dimension one and dimensions at least two. We prove the analogues of these results for the variational problem and singular Abreu equations in dimension one, and use the approximation scheme to obtain a characterization of limiting minimizers to the one-dimensional variational problem.</description>

      <title>Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality via a new pointwise estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new type of pointwise estimate of the Kalamajska-Mazya-Shaposhnikova type, where sparse averaging operators replace the maximal operator. It allows us to extend the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality to all rearrangement invariant Banach function spaces without any assumptions on their upper Boyd index, i.e. omitting problems caused by unboundedness of maximal operator on spaces close to $L^1$. In particular, we remove unnecessary assumptions from the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in the setting of Orlicz and Lorentz spaces. The applied method is new in this context and may be seen as a kind of sparse domination technique fitted to the context of rearrangement invariant Banach function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove some families of geometric inequalities in hyperbolic space and sphere by some kinds of locally constrained flows. In hyperbolic space, we obtain the geometric inequalities involving two weighted curvature integrals for static convex domains. While in sphere, a new family of ``three terms'' geometric inequalities involving two weighted curvature integrals and one quermassintegral are proved. Unlike hyperbolic spaces, we also obtain an inverse weighted geometric inequality in sphere.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis and numerical comparison of energy-conservative schemes for the Zakharov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Furihata and Matsuo proposed in 2010 an energy-conserving scheme for the Zakharov equations, as an application of the discrete variational derivative method (DVDM).
  This scheme is distinguished from conventional methods (in particular the one devised by Glassey in 1992) in that the invariants are consistent with respect to time, but it has not been sufficiently studied both theoretically and numerically.
  In this study, we theoretically prove the solvability under the loosest possible assumptions.
  We also prove the convergence of this DVDM scheme by improving the argument by Glassey.
  Furthermore, we perform intensive numerical experiments for comparing the above two schemes.
  It is found that the DVDM scheme is superior in terms of accuracy, but since it is fully-implicit, the linearly-implicit Glassey scheme is better for practical efficiency.
  In addition, we proposed a way to choose a solution for the first step that would allow Glassey's scheme to work more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a detailed computational framework designed to analyze and forecast the complex multiphase characteristics of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are essential for developing sustainable technological advancements. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have a significant thermo-electromechanical response, although their electromechanical characteristics vary throughout different phases of the material. Lead-free piezoelectric materials undergo phase changes, including rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases, when the temperature changes. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, multiple phases exist simultaneously under certain temperature, electrical, and mechanical conditions, resulting in the material displaying intricate multiphase behavior. Studying such behaviour is crucial for evaluating the performance of these materials. The computational approach in this research relies on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to model micro-domain phase changes in the material. This research will enhance our comprehension of the significance of complex multiphase behaviour in creating environment-friendly and sustainable technological solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with breather solutions of a radially symmetric curl-curl wave equation with double power nonlinearity. By considering the solutions with a special form, we obtain a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by the radial variable. Then we characterize periodic behaviors and analyze the joint effects of the double power nonlinear terms on the minimal period and the maximal amplitude. Under certain conditions, we construct a breather solution for the original curl-curl wave equation and find such a solution which can generate a continuum of phase-shifted breathers.</description>

      <title>The evolution problem for the 1D nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation with a top hat kernel. Part 1. The Cauchy problem on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem on the real line for the nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation in one spatial dimension, \[ u_t = D u_{xx} + u(1-\phi*u), \] where $\phi*u$ is a spatial convolution with the top hat kernel, $\phi(y) \equiv H\left(\frac{1}{4}-y^2\right)$.
  After showing that the problem is globally well-posed, we demonstrate that positive, spatially-periodic solutions bifurcate from the spatially-uniform steady state solution $u=1$ as the diffusivity, $D$, decreases through $\Delta_1 \approx 0.00297$. We explicitly construct these spatially-periodic solutions as uniformly-valid asymptotic approximations for $D \ll 1$, over one wavelength, via the method of matched asymptotic expansions. These consist, at leading order, of regularly-spaced, compactly-supported regions with width of $O(1)$ where $u=O(1)$, separated by regions where $u$ is exponentially small at leading order as $D \to 0^+$.
  From numerical solutions, we find that for $D \geq \Delta_1$, permanent form travelling waves, with minimum wavespeed, $2 \sqrt{D}$, are generated, whilst for $0 &lt; D &lt; \Delta_1$, the wavefronts generated separate the regions where $u=0$ from a region where a steady periodic solution is created. The structure of these transitional travelling waves is examined in some detail.</description>

Abstract: Control properties of the Kawahara equation are considered when the equation is posed on an unbounded domain. Precisely, the paper's main results are related to an approximation theorem that ensures the exact (internal) controllability in $(0,+\infty)$. Following Rosier SIAM Simon (2000), the problem is reduced to prove an approximate theorem which is achieved thanks to a global Carleman estimate for the Kawahara operator.</description>

Abstract: In this note we point out some simple sufficient (plausible) conditions for `turbulence' cascades in suitable limits of damped, stochastically-driven nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a $d$-dimensional periodic box. Simple characterizations of dissipation anomalies for the wave action and kinetic energy in rough analogy with those that arise for fully developed turbulence in the 2D Navier-Stokes equations are given and sufficient conditions are given which differentiate between a `weak' turbulence regime and a `strong' turbulence regime. The proofs are relatively straightforward once the statements are identified, but we hope that it might be useful for thinking about mathematically precise formulations of the statistically-stationary wave turbulence problem.</description>

We consider our domain to have an inaccessible portion of the boundary where neither the input can be prescribed nor the output can be measured.

Abstract: Let $s \in (0,1)$ and $N &gt;2s$. In this paper, we consider the following class of nonlocal semipositone problems: \begin{align*}
  (-\Delta)^s u= g(x)f_a(u) \text { in } \mathbb{R}^N, \; u &gt; 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{align*} where the weight $g \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is positive, $a&gt;0$ is a parameter, and $f_a \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$ is strictly negative on $(-\infty,0]$. For $f_a$ having subcritical growth and weaker Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type nonlinearity, we prove that the above problem admits a mountain pass solution $u_a$, provided `$a$' is near zero. To obtain the positivity of $u_a$, we establish a Brezis-Kato type uniform estimate of $(u_a)$ in $L^r(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for every $r \in [\frac{2N}{N-2s}, \infty]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the focusing cubic wave equation on a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $3$, the dichotomy between global existence and blow-up for solutions starting below the energy of the ground state is known since the work of Payne and Sattinger. In the case of a damped equation, we prove that the dichotomy between global existence and blow-up still holds. In particular, the damping does not prevent blow-up. Assuming that the damping satisfies the geometric control condition, we then prove that any global solution converges to a stationary solution along a time sequence, and that global solutions below the energy of the ground state can be stabilised, adapting the proof of a similar result in the defocusing case.</description>

As a consequence of our regularity results we deduce a weighted Sobolev inequality that leads to weak comparison principles. As a corollary we run over the moving plane technique to deduce symmetry and monotonicity results for the solutions, under suitable assumptions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, which corresponds to an updated version of the author's Habilitation lecture in Mathematics, we do an overview of several topics in elliptic problems. We review some old and new results regarding the Lane-Emden equation, both under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, then focus on sign-changing solutions for Lane-Emden systems. We also survey some results regarding fully nontrivial solutions to gradient elliptic systems with mixed cooperative and competitive interactions. We conclude by exhibiting results on optimal partition problems, with cost functions either related to Dirichlet eigenvalues or to the Yamabe equation. Several open problems are referred along the text.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution for the energy critical damped wave equations in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider energy-critical damped wave equation \begin{equation*} \partial_{tt}u-\Delta u+\alpha \partial_t u=\left|u\right|^{\frac{4}{D-2}}u \end{equation*} with radial initial data in dimensions $D\geq 4$. The equation has a nontrivial radial stationary solution $W$, called the ground state, which is unique up to sign and scale. We prove that any bounded energy norm solution behaves asymptotically as a superposition of the modulated ground states and a radiation term. In the global case, particularly, the solution converges to a pure multi-bubble due to the damping effect.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingale solutions to the hybrid slow-fast system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.06878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the weak convergence for a slow-fast system with jumps modulated by Markovian switching regimes with the martingale method. However, due to the coexistence of fast component and Markovian switching regimes, the martingale method and perturbed test functions can not be applied directly. In this situation, a combination of perturbed test functions and the time discretization is applied efficiently. And the choice of appropriate perturbed test functions, which are related to the averaged coefficients, plays a decisive role. Our results also cover the case of slow-fast system without Markovian switching regimes. Finally, some examples are presented,and numerical simulations are carried out to observe a good agreement.</description>

      <title>Quantized collision invariants on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a measurable function $g:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to\mathbb{R}$, with $d\geq 3$, satisfies the functional relation
\begin{equation*}
g(\omega)+g(\omega_*)=g(\omega')+g(\omega_*'),
\end{equation*}
for all admissible $\omega,\omega_*,\omega',\omega_*'\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in the sense that
\begin{equation*}
\omega+\omega_*=\omega'+\omega_*',
\end{equation*}
if and only if it can be written as
\begin{equation*}
g(\omega)=A+B\cdot\omega,
\end{equation*}
for some constants $A\in \mathbb{R}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Such functions form a family of quantized collision invariants which play a fundamental role in the study of hydrodynamic regimes of the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation near Fermionic condensates, i.e., at low temperatures. In particular, they characterize the elastic collisional dynamics of Fermions near a statistical equilibrium where quantum effects are predominant.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically non-negative Ricci curvature, elliptic Kato constant and isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ABP method for proving isoperimetric inequalities has been first employed by Cabr\'e in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then developed by Brendle, notably in the context of non-compact Riemannian manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature and positive asymptotic volume ratio. In this paper, we expand upon their approach and prove isoperimetric inequalities (sharp in the limit) in the presence of a small amount of negative curvature. First, we consider smallness of the negative part $\mathrm{Ric}_-$ of the Ricci curvature in terms of its elliptic Kato constant. Indeed, the Kato constant turns out to control the non-negativity of the ($\infty$-)Bakry-\'Emery Ricci-tensor of a suitable conformal deformation of the manifold, and the ABP method can be implemented in this setting. Secondly, we show that the smallness of the Kato constant is implied by a suitable polynomial decay of $\mathrm{Ric}_-$, provided that the asymptotic volume ratio is positive and either (a) $M$ has one end and asymptotically non-negative sectional curvature or (b) the relative volume comparison known as $\textbf{(VC)}$ condition holds. To show this latter fact, we enhance techniques elaborated by Li-Tam and Kasue to obtain new estimates of the Green function valid on the whole manifold.</description>

      <title>Embracing Uncertainty Flexibility: Harnessing a Supervised Tree Kernel to Empower Ensemble Modelling for 2D Echocardiography-Based Prediction of Right Ventricular Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The right ventricular (RV) function deterioration strongly predicts clinical outcomes in numerous circumstances. To boost the clinical deployment of ensemble regression methods that quantify RV volumes using tabular data from the widely available two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), we propose to complement the volume predictions with uncertainty scores. To this end, we employ an instance-based method which uses the learned tree structure to identify the nearest training samples to a target instance and then uses a number of distribution types to more flexibly model the output. The probabilistic and point-prediction performances of the proposed framework are evaluated on a relatively small-scale dataset, comprising 100 end-diastolic and end-systolic RV volumes. The reference values for point performance were obtained from MRI. The results demonstrate that our flexible approach yields improved probabilistic and point performances over other state-of-the-art methods. The appropriateness of the proposed framework is showcased by providing exemplar cases. The estimated uncertainty embodies both aleatoric and epistemic types. This work aligns with trustworthy artificial intelligence since it can be used to enhance the decision-making process and reduce risks. The feature importance scores of our framework can be exploited to reduce the number of required 2DE views which could enhance the proposed pipeline's clinical application.</description>
