      <title>Applicability of oculomics for individual risk prediction: Repeatability and robustness of retinal Fractal Dimension using DART and AutoMorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether Fractal Dimension (FD)-based oculomics could be used for individual risk prediction by evaluating repeatability and robustness. Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter {\lambda} which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p&lt;0.0001). Median {\lambda} in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with {\lambda} (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theories of state- and generation-dependent cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a general, high-dimensional kinetic theory describing the internal state (such as gene expression or protein levels) of cells in a stochastically evolving population. The resolution of our kinetic theory also allows one to track subpopulations associated with each generation. Both intrinsic noise of the cell's internal attribute and randomness in a cell's division times (demographic stochasticity) are fundamental to the development of our model. Based on this general framework, we are able to marginalize the high-dimensional kinetic PDEs in a number of different ways to derive equations that describe the dynamics of marginalized or "macroscopic" quantities such as structured population densities, moments of generation-dependent cellular states, and moments of the total population. We also show how nonlinear "interaction" terms in lower-dimensional integrodifferential equations can arise from high-dimensional linear kinetic models that contain rate parameters of a cell (birth and death rates) that depend on variables associated with other cells, generating couplings in the dynamics. Our analysis provides a general, more complete mathematical framework that resolves the coevolution of cell populations and cell states. The approach may be tailored for studying, e.g., gene expression in developing tissues, or other more general particle systems which exhibit Brownian noise in individual attributes and population-level demographic noise.</description>

      <title>PR-NET: Leveraging Pathway Refined Network Structures for Prostate Cancer Patient Condition Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: The diagnosis and monitoring of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) are crucial for cancer patients, but the current models (such as P-NET) have limitations in terms of parameter count, generalization, and cost. Results: To address the above issues, we develop a more accurate and efficient Prostate Cancer patient condition prediction model, named PR-NET. By compressing and optimizing the network structure of P-NET, the model complexity is reduced while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. The PR-NET demonstrated superior performance in predicting prostate cancer patient outcomes, outshining P-NET and six other traditional models with a significant margin. In our rigorous evaluation, PR-NET not only achieved impressive average AUC and Recall scores of 0.94 and 0.83, respectively, on known data but also maintained robust generalizability on five unknown datasets with a higher average AUC of 0.73 and Recall of 0.72, compared to P-NET's 0.68 and 0.5. PR-NET's efficiency was evidenced by its shorter average training and inference times, and its gene-level analysis revealed 46 key genes, demonstrating its enhanced predictive power and efficiency in identifying critical biomarkers for prostate cancer. Future research can further expand its application domains and optimize the model's performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>An in-silico approach to meniscus tissue regeneration: Modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes evolving in a nonwoven polyethylene terephtalate (PET) scaffold impregnated with hyaluron and supplied with a differentiation medium. The scaffold and the cells are assumed to be contained in a bioreactor with fluid perfusion. The differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes favors the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and is influenced by fluid stress. The model takes deformations of ECM and PET scaffold into account. The scaffold structure is explicitly included by statistical assessment of the fibre distribution from CT images. The effective macroscopic equations are obtained by appropriate upscaling from dynamics on lower (microscopic and mesoscopic) scales and feature in the motility terms an explicit cell diffusion tensor encoding the assessed anisotropic scaffold structure. Numerical simulations show its influence on the overall cell and tissue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conditional Score-Based Diffusion Model for Cortical Thickness Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by diverse progression rates among individuals, with changes in cortical thickness (CTh) closely linked to its progression. Accurately forecasting CTh trajectories can significantly enhance early diagnosis and intervention strategies, providing timely care. However, the longitudinal data essential for these studies often suffer from temporal sparsity and incompleteness, presenting substantial challenges in modeling the disease's progression accurately. Existing methods are limited, focusing primarily on datasets without missing entries or requiring predefined assumptions about CTh progression. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a conditional score-based diffusion model specifically designed to generate CTh trajectories with the given baseline information, such as age, sex, and initial diagnosis. Our conditional diffusion model utilizes all available data during the training phase to make predictions based solely on baseline information during inference without needing prior history about CTh progression. The prediction accuracy of the proposed CTh prediction pipeline using a conditional score-based model was compared for sub-groups consisting of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD subjects. The Bland-Altman analysis shows our diffusion-based prediction model has a near-zero bias with narrow 95% confidential interval compared to the ground-truth CTh in 6-36 months. In addition, our conditional diffusion model has a stochastic generative nature, therefore, we demonstrated an uncertainty analysis of patient-specific CTh prediction through multiple realizations.</description>

      <title>An agent-based modelling framework to study growth mechanisms in EGFR-L858R mutant alveolar type II cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in never-smoker patients. However, these mutations are not always carcinogenic, and have recently been reported in histologically normal lung tissue from patients with and without lung cancer. To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem cells, we grew murine alveolar type-II organoids monoclonally in a 3D Matrigel. Our experiments showed that the \textit{EGFR-L858R} mutation induced a change in organoid structure: mutated organoids displayed more `budding', in comparison to non-mutant controls, which were nearly spherical. We perform on-lattice computational simulations, which suggest that this can be explained by the concentration of division amongst a small number of cells on the surface of the organoid, which may arise from several possible biological mechanisms. These results suggest that the L858R mutation produces structures which expand quickly from surface protrusions. We are currently unable to distinguish the cell-based mechanisms that lead to this spatial heterogeneity in growth, but suggest a number of future experiments which could be used to do so. We suggest that the likelihood of L858R-fuelled tumorigenesis is affected not just by random fluctuations in cell fitness, but by whether the mutation arises in a spatial environment that allows mutant cells to reproduce without being forced to encounter each other. These data may have implications for cancer prevention strategies and for understanding NSCLC progression.</description>

      <title>Automated Importance Sampling via Optimal Control for Stochastic Reaction Networks: A Markovian Projection-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel alternative approach to our previous work (Ben Hammouda et al., 2023) to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) estimators for rare event probabilities for stochastic reaction networks (SRNs). In the same spirit of (Ben Hammouda et al., 2023), an efficient path-dependent measure change is derived based on a connection between determining optimal importance sampling (IS) parameters within a class of probability measures and a stochastic optimal control formulation, corresponding to solving a variance minimization problem. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the encountered curse of dimensionality by mapping the problem to a significantly lower-dimensional space via a Markovian projection (MP) idea. The output of this model reduction technique is a low-dimensional SRN (potentially even one dimensional) that preserves the marginal distribution of the original high-dimensional SRN system. The dynamics of the projected process are obtained by solving a related optimization problem via a discrete $L^2$ regression. By solving the resulting projected Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for the reduced-dimensional SRN, we obtain projected IS parameters, which are then mapped back to the original full-dimensional SRN system, resulting in an efficient IS-MC estimator for rare events probabilities of the full-dimensional SRN. Our analysis and numerical experiments reveal that the proposed MP-HJB-IS approach substantially reduces the MC estimator variance, resulting in a lower computational complexity in the rare event regime than standard MC estimators.</description>

      <title>3D molecule generation by denoising voxel grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new score-based approach to generate 3D molecules represented as atomic densities on regular grids. First, we train a denoising neural network that learns to map from a smooth distribution of noisy molecules to the distribution of real molecules. Then, we follow the neural empirical Bayes framework (Saremi and Hyvarinen, 19) and generate molecules in two steps: (i) sample noisy density grids from a smooth distribution via underdamped Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo, and (ii) recover the "clean" molecule by denoising the noisy grid with a single step. Our method, VoxMol, generates molecules in a fundamentally different way than the current state of the art (ie, diffusion models applied to atom point clouds). It differs in terms of the data representation, the noise model, the network architecture and the generative modeling algorithm. Our experiments show that VoxMol captures the distribution of drug-like molecules better than state of the art, while being faster to generate samples.</description>

      <title>Topologically Regularized Multiple Instance Learning to Harness Data Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biomedical data analysis, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have emerged as a powerful tool to classify patients' microscopy samples. However, the data-intensive requirement of these models poses a significant challenge in scenarios with scarce data availability, e.g., in rare diseases. We introduce a topological regularization term to MIL to mitigate this challenge. It provides a shape-preserving inductive bias that compels the encoder to maintain the essential geometrical-topological structure of input bags during projection into latent space. This enhances the performance and generalization of the MIL classifier regardless of the aggregation function, particularly for scarce training data. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed through experiments across a range of datasets, showing an average enhancement of 2.8% for MIL benchmarks, 15.3% for synthetic MIL datasets, and 5.5% for real-world biomedical datasets over the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>DeepCRE: Revolutionizing Drug R&amp;D with Cutting-Edge Computational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of pharmaceutical development and therapeutic application both face substantial challenges. The therapeutic domain calls for more treatment alternatives, while numerous promising pre-clinical drugs have failed in clinical trials. One of the reasons is the inadequacy of Cross-drug Response Evaluation (CRE) during the late stage of drug development. Although in-silico CRE models offer a solution to this problem, existing methodologies are either limited to early development stages or lack the capacity for a comprehensive CRE analysis. Herein, we introduce a novel computational model named DeepCRE and present the potential of DeepCRE in advancing therapeutic discovery and development. DeepCRE outperforms the existing best models by achieving an average performance improvement of 17.7\% in patient-level CRE and a 5-fold increase in indication-level CRE. Furthermore, DeepCRE has identified six drug candidates that show significantly greater effectiveness than a comparator set of two approved drugs in 5/8 colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids. This highlights DeepCRE's ability to identify a collection of drug candidates with superior therapeutic effects, underscoring its potential to revolutionize the field of therapeutic development.</description>
