      <title>Platonic quasi-normal modes expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic wave manipulation using large arrays of resonators is driving the need for advanced simulation and optimization methods. To address this we introduce and explore a robust framework for wave control: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Specifically we consider the problem for thin elastic plates, where the Green's function formalism is well known and readily exploited to solve multiple scattering problems. By studying the associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem we derive a dispersive QNM expansion, providing a reduced-order model for efficient forced response computations which reveals physical insight into the resonant mode excitation. Furthermore, we derive eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to resonator parameters and apply a gradient-based optimization to design quasi-bound states in the continuum and position eigenfrequencies precisely in the complex plane. Scattering simulations validate our approach in structures such as graded line arrays and quasi-crystals. Drawing on QNM concepts from electromagnetism we demonstrate significant advances in elastic metamaterials, highlighting their potential for tailored wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Kinetic Effects of Charged Vacancies on Electromechanical Responses of Ferroelectrics: Rayleighian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding time-dependent effects of charged vacancies on electromechanical responses of materials is at the forefront of research for designing materials exhibiting metal-insulator transition, and memresistive behavior. A Rayleighian approach is used to develop a model for studying the non-linear kinetics of reaction leading to generation of vacancies and electrons by the dissociation of vacancy-electron pairs. Also, diffusion and elastic effects of charged vacancies are considered to model polarization-electric potential and strain-electric potential hysteresis loops. The model captures multi-physics phenomena by introducing couplings among polarization, electric potential, stress, strain, and concentrations of charged (multivalent) vacancies and electrons (treated as classical negatively charged particles), where the concentrations can vary due to association-dissociation reactions. Derivation of coupled time-dependent equations based on the Rayleighian approach is presented. Three limiting cases of the governing equations are considered highlighting effects of 1) non-linear reaction kinetics on the generation of charged vacancies and electrons, 2) the Vegard's law (i.e., the concentration-dependent local strain) on asymmetric strain-electric potential relations, and 3) coupling between a fast component and the slow component of the net polarization on the polarization-electric field relations. The Rayleighian approach discussed in this work should pave the way for developing a multi-scale modeling framework in a thermodynamically consistent manner while capturing multi-physics phenomena in ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>A structural analysis of ordered Cs$_{3}$Sb films grown on single crystal graphene and silicon carbide substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali antimonides are well established as high efficiency, low intrinsic emittance photocathodes for accelerators and photon detectors. However, conventionally grown alkali antimonide films are polycrystalline with surface disorder and roughness that can limit achievable beam brightness. Ordering the crystalline structure of alkali antimonides has the potential to deliver higher brightness electron beams by reducing surface disorder and enabling the engineering of material properties at the level of atomic layers. In this report, we demonstrate the growth of ordered Cs$_{3}$Sb films on single crystal substrates 3C-SiC and graphene-coated 4H-SiC using pulsed laser deposition and conventional thermal evaporation growth techniques. The crystalline structures of the Cs$_{3}$Sb films were examined using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) diagnostics, while film thickness and roughness estimates were made using x-ray reflectivity (XRR). With these tools, we observed ordered domains in less than 10 nm thick films with quantum efficiencies greater than one percent at 530 nm. Moreover, we identify structural features such as Laue oscillations indicative of highly ordered films. We found that Cs$_{3}$Sb films grew with flat, fiber-textured surfaces on 3C-SiC and with multiple ordered domains and sub-nanometer surface roughness on graphene-coated 4H-SiC under our growth conditions. We identify the crystallographic orientations of Cs$_{3}$Sb grown on graphene-coated 4H-SiC substrates and discuss the significance of examining the crystal structure of these films for growing epitaxial heterostructures in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectricity in NbI$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity was originally proposed to elucidate the out-of-plane polarization generated by a specific stacking arrangement of non-polar van der Waals layers. However, the concept of sliding ferroelectricity can be generalized to more geometries. Here, the NbI$_4$ bulk is theoretical demonstrated as a quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectric material, which exhibits a polarization of $0.11$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$ perpendicular to the Nb's chains. The most possible ferroelectric switching path is found to be via the interchain sliding along the chain direction, while other paths like Peierls-dimerization of Nb pairs may also work. Moreover, its polarization can be augmented for $82\%$ by hydrostatic pressure up to $10$ GPa, beyond which NbI$_4$ becomes a polar metal. In addition, the negative longitudinal piezoelectricity is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Small exciton effective mass in QL Bi2Se2Te: A material platform towards high-temperature excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles simulations combined with many-body calculations, we show that two-dimensional free-standing quintuple-layer Bi2Se2Te is an inversion symmetric monolayer expected to achieve spatially indirect exciton with large exciton radius, small exciton effective mass and long exciton lifetime. Such system is theoretically predicted to be a promising platform for realizing excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluid due to its high phase transition temperatures of ~257 K and ~64.25 K for the BEC and excitonic superfluid, respectively. The importance of spin-orbit coupling is revealed, and the angular momentum selection rules for photon absorption are discussed. This finding suggests the potential of QL Bi2Se2Te monolayer with exotic bosonic bound states provides as a tantalizing high-temperature platform to probe excitonic physics.</description>

      <title>Effects of GaAs buffer layer on quantum anomalous Hall insulator Vy(BixSb1-x)2-yTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the growth, structural characterization, and transport properties of the quantum anomalous Hall insulator Vy(BixSb1-x)2-yTe3 (VBST) grown on a GaAs buffer layer by molecular beam epitaxy on a GaAs(111)A substrate. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that the implementation of a GaAs buffer layer improves the crystal and interface quality compared to the control sample grown directly on an InP substrate. Both samples exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), but with similar thermal stability despite the different structural properties. Notably, the QAHE in the sample grown on a GaAs buffer layer displays a significantly larger (almost double) coercive field with a much smaller resistivity peak at the magnetization reversal. Possible effects of the interface quality on the magnetic properties of VBST and the QAHE are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we conclusively demonstrate that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by overscreening issues. Additionally, we present an exact formula designed to incorporate nonadiabatic and correlation effects while ensuring the positivity of the linewidths. Finally, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>The defect energy formalism for CALPHAD thermodynamics of dilute point defects: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of point defects is crucial for determining the functional properties of materials. Defect stability is typically assessed using grand-canonical defect formation energy, which requires deducing the equilibrium chemical potential or Fermi level. This process is complicated by the interplay of chemical potential and Fermi level and their dependence on composition and temperature. The grand-canonical formation energy is added to the bulk Gibbs energy, creating a defect-centric framework where each new defect state needs a distinct Gibbs energy formulation. The CALPHAD method offers a more flexible alternative by integrating defect energies into the total Gibbs energy model, allowing easier extrapolation to complex compositions. CALPHAD unifies the analysis of chemically and electronically driven defects using chemical composition as the primary variable. However, the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF) used in CALPHAD has limitations, such as a lack of clear connections between defect formation energies and Gibbs energy parameters and an exponential increase in complexity with added chemical or charge variations. We present the theoretical derivation of the Defect Energy Formalism (DEF), which overcomes CEF limitations by establishing explicit relationships between absolute defect energies - independent of chemical potential and Fermi level - and the Gibbs energy parameters of defective compounds. This results in a first-principles model for dilute defects, eliminating the need for model fitting to experimental or simulation data. DEF reduces the complexity of CEF by applying the superposition of absolute defect energies, making it feasible for modeling multi-component and chemically complex compounds. This paper presents a formal derivation of DEF and offers guidelines for its application, promising more accurate and efficient thermodynamic modeling of defective materials.</description>

      <title>Direct Nanopatterning of Complex 3D Surfaces and Self-Aligned Superlattices via Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional lithography methods involving pattern transfer through resist templating face challenges of material compatibility with various process solvents. Other approaches of direct material writing often compromise pattern complexity and overlay accuracy. Here we explore a concept based on the moir\'e interference of molecular beams to directly pattern complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces made by any evaporable materials, such as metals, oxides and organic semiconductors. Our proposed approach, termed the Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography (MBHL), relies on precise control over angular projections of material flux passing through nanoapertures superimposed on the substrate, emulating the interference of coherent laser beams in interference lithography. Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nanometers, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling new nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Proton Tunneling: A New Insight into Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the key step for energy conversion in electrocatalysis. Atomic-scale simulation performs as an indispensable tool to provide microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the quantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical (GC) constant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to explicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient GC sampling, further assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical conditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET simulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a physical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring protons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET paths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to classical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of proton tunneling may reshape our fundamental understanding on other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios of energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>An extended Rice model for intergranular fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plastic events occurring during the process of intergranular fracture in metals is still not well understood due to the complexity of grain boundary (GB) structures and their interactions with crack-tip dislocation plasticity. By considering the local GB structural transformation after dislocation emission from a GB in the Peierls-type Rice-Beltz model, herein we established a semi-analytical transition-state-theory-based framework to predict the most probable Mode-I stress intensity factor (SIF) for dislocation emission from a cracked GB. Using large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we studied the fracture behaviors of bi-crystalline Fe samples with 12 different symmetric tilt GBs inside. The MD results demonstrate that the presence of GB could significantly change the SIF required for the activation of plastic events, confirming the theoretical predictions that attributes this to the energy change caused by the transformation of GB structure. Both the atomistic simulation and the theoretical model consistently indicate that, the critical dynamic SIF ($K_{I}^{c}(t)$) at which the dynamic SIF $K_{I}(t)$ deviates from the linearity with respect to the strain ${\epsilon}$, increases with the increasing loading rate. However, the classical Rice model underestimates the $K_{I}^{c}(t)$ due to its failure to consider the effects of localized fields. The present theoretical model provides a mechanism-based framework for the application of grain boundary engineering in the design and fabrication of nano-grained metals.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Mott transistor based on resistive switching in disordered V2O3 films grown on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field-induced giant resistive switching triggered by insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is one of the promising approaches for developing a new class of electronics often referred to as Mottronics. Achieving this resistive switching by minimal external field at room temperature is of paramount research and technological interest. Mott-IMT is often associated with structural modification, which is very important for optoelectronic and actuator applications. Here, we report a giant resistive switching of about 900 % at room temperature in disordered polycrystalline V2O3-Si thin film stabilized at the IMT phase boundary and associated structural transformation under a small electric field. The increase of electron population in the a1g band under the field is responsible for the Mott gap collapse that drives the structural transition. Furthermore, we also fabricated a room temperature Mott-FET with a channel ON/OFF resistive ratio of about 15. This study provides a fundamental mechanism of the Mott-IMT in V2O3 as well as its device applications.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in non-magnetic Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an investigation of the phonon thermal Hall effect in single crystal samples of Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$. We measured the field-linear thermal Hall effect in all three samples. The temperature dependence of thermal Hall conductivities shows a peak around 15 K, which coincides with the peak positions of the longitudinal thermal conductivities. The temperature-dependent longitudinal thermal conductivities indicates that phonons dominate thermal transport in all three samples. However, the presence of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic ions introduces significant effects on the field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivities. The thermal Hall ratio is sizeable in all three samples and consistent with the values reported for other insulating materials exhibiting a phononic thermal Hall effect, though their exact underlying mechanism remains yet to be identified. The thermal Hall ratio is nearly the same for $\rm Y_2Ti_2O_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$, and slightly larger for Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, suggesting that magnetic impurities are less significant in generating the phononic thermal Hall effect. Our observations of the phononic thermal Hall effect support an intrinsic origin in Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, but suggest a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic effects in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Energy Filtering in Doping Modulated Nanoengineered Thermoelectric Materials: A Monte Carlo Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo electronic transport simulations, coupled self-consistently with the Poisson equation for electrostatics, we explore the thermoelectric power factor of nanoengineered materials. These materials consist of alternating highly doped and intrinsic regions on the scale of several nanometers. This structure enables the creation of potential wells and barriers, implementing a mechanism for filtering carrier energy. Our study demonstrates that by carefully designing the nanostructure, we can significantly enhance its thermoelectric power factor compared to the original pristine material. Importantly, these enhancements stem not only from the energy filtering effect that boosts the Seebeck coefficient but also from the utilization of high-energy carriers within the wells and intrinsic barrier regions to maintain relatively high electronic conductivity. These findings can offer guidance for the design and optimization of new-generation thermoelectric materials through improvements in the power factor.</description>

      <title>Impact of terahertz short pulses on the oxygen defect state in TiO$_{2-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen deficient titanium dioxide (TiO$_{2-x}$) is a very attractive material for several applications ranging from photocatalysis to resistive switching. Oxygen vacancies turn insulating anatase titanium dioxide into a polaronic conductor, while creating a defect state band below the ultraviolet semiconducting gap. Here we employ a combination of broadband infrared (IR) reflectivity and THz-pump/IR-probe measurements to investigate the relationship between localized defect states and delocalized conducting polaronic states. We show that the THz pump allows to convert deeply localized electrons into metastable polarons with a lifetime in the ns range. These long-lived metastable states may find application in novel opto-electronic applications exploiting the interplay of dc resistivity, with terahertz and infrared signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is essential for advancing technologies based on thin films. X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis can access relevant atomic structure details spanning local-, mid-, and long-range order. While X-ray PDF has been adapted for thin films on amorphous substrates, measurements on single crystal substrates are necessary to accurately determine structure origins for some thin film materials, especially those for which the substrate changes the accessible structure and properties. However, when measuring films on single crystal substrates, high intensity anisotropic Bragg spots saturate 2D detector images, overshadowing the thin films' isotropic scattering signal. This renders previous data processing methods for films on amorphous substrates unsuitable for films on single crystal substrates. To address this measurement need, we developed IsoDAT2D, an innovative data processing approach using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The program combines non-negative matrix factorization and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to separate thin film and single crystal substrate X-ray scattering signals. We use SimDAT2D, a program we developed to generate synthetic thin film data, to validate IsoDAT2D. We also use IsoDAT2D to isolate X-ray total scattering signal from a thin film on a single crystal substrate. The resulting PDF data are compared to similar data processed using previous methods, demonstrating superior performance relative to substrate subtraction with a single crystal substrate and similar performance to substrate subtraction from an amorphous substrate. With IsoDAT2D, there are new opportunities to expand PDF to a wider variety of thin films, including those on single crystal substrates, with which new structure-property relationships can be elucidated to enable fundamental understanding and technological advances.</description>

      <title>The role of precursor coverage in the synthesis and substrate transfer of graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with atomically precise widths and edge topologies have well-defined band gaps that depend on ribbon dimensions, making them ideal for room-temperature switching applications like field-effect transistors (FETs). For efficient device integration, it is crucial to optimize growth conditions to maximize GNR length and, consequently, device yield. Here, we investigate the growth and alignment of 9-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (9-AGNRs) on a vicinal gold substrate, Au(788), with varying molecular precursor doses (PD) and, therefore, different resulting GNR coverages. Our investigation reveals that GNR growth location on the Au(788) substrate is coverage-dependent. Furthermore, scanning tunneling microscopy shows a strong correlation between the GNR length evolution and both the PD and the GNR growth location on the substrate. Employing Raman spectroscopy, we analyze samples with eight different PDs on Au(788). We find that GNR alignment improves with length, achieving near-perfect alignment with an average GNR length of ~40 nm for GNRs growing solely at Au(788) step edges. To fully exploit GNR properties in device architectures, GNRs need to be transferred from the gold to semiconducting or insulating substrates. Upon substrate transfer, samples with higher PD present systematically better alignment preservation and less surface disorder, which we attribute to reduced GNR mobility during the transfer process. PD also affects the substrate transfer success rate, with higher success rates observed for samples with higher GNR coverages (77%) compared to those with lower GNR coverages (53%). Our findings characterize the important relationship between precursor dose, GNR length, alignment quality, and surface disorder during GNR growth and upon substrate transfer, offering crucial insights for the further development of GNR-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetism in Ising-type van der Waals Magnet FePS3 by Lithium Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, layered materials transition metal thiophosphate MPX3 (M = transition metals, X = S or Se) have gained significant attention because of their rich magnetic, optical, and electronic properties. Specifically, the diverse magnetic structures and the robustness of magnetism in the two-dimensional limit have made them prominent candidates to study two-dimensional magnetism. Numerous efforts such as substitutions and interlayer intercalations have been made to tune the properties of these materials, which has greatly deepened the understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the properties. In this work, we focus on modifying the magnetism of Ising-type antiferromagnet FePS3 using electrochemical lithium intercalation. Our work unveils the effectiveness of electrochemical intercalation as a controllable tool to modulating magnetism, including tuning magnetic ordering temperature and inducing low temperature spin-glass state, offering an approach for implementing this material into applications.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale ferroelectric programming of van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to create superlattices in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures via moir\'e interference heralded a new era in the science and technology of two-dimensional materials. Through precise control of the twist angle, flat bands and strongly correlated phases have been engineered. The precise twisting of vdW layers is in some sense a bottom-up approach--a single parameter can dial in a wide range of periodic structures. Here, we describe a top-down approach to engineering nanoscale potentials in vdW layers using a buried programmable ferroelectric layer. Ultra-low-voltage electron beam lithography (ULV-EBL) is used to program ferroelectric domains in a ferroelectric Al_{1-x}B_{x}N thin film through a graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure that is transferred on top. We demonstrate ferroelectric field effects by creating a lateral p-n junction, and demonstrate spatial resolution down to 35 nm, limited by the resolution of our scanned probe characterization methods. This innovative, resist-free patterning method is predicted to achieve 10 nm resolution and enable arbitrary programming of vdW layers, opening a pathway to create new phases that are inaccessible by moir\'e techniques. The ability to "paint" different phases of matter on a single vdW "canvas" provides a wealth of new electronic and photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of fast and slow excitons with an exchange in quasi-two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of analytical calculations and numerical simulations we study the diffusion properties in quasi-two-dimensional structures with two exciton subsystems with an exchange between them. The experimental realisation is possible in systems where fast and slow exciton subsystems appear. For substantially different diffusion coefficients of the species the negative diffusion can be observed, if one measures the transport properties of only a single subsystem, just as was obtained in experimental studies for quasi-two-dimensional semiconductor systems. The initial transition from a fast subsystem to a slow one results in a delayed release of fast excitons in the area close to the original excitation spot. Hence, the signal from the fast excitons alone includes the delayed replenishment from the transition of slow quasi-particles. This is seen as the narrowing of the exciton density profile or decrease of mean-squared displacement which is then interpreted as a negative diffusion. The average diffusion coefficients for the combined population are analytically expressed through the diffusion coefficients of fast and slow excitons. Simple analytical expressions for effective diffusion coefficients obtained in limiting cases are of interest both for theoretical and experimental analysis of not only the exciton transport, but also for a variety of systems, where fast and slow moving subsystems are present.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the quasiparticle behaviour in the pressure-induced high-$T_c$ phase of an iron-chalcogenide superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity of iron chalocogenides is strongly enhanced under applied pressure yet its underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a quantum oscillations study up to 45 T in the high-$T_c$ phase of tetragonal FeSe$_{0.82}$S$_{0.18}$ up to 22 kbar. Under applied pressure, the quasi-two dimensional multiband Fermi surface expands and the effective masses remain large, whereas the superconductivity displays a three-fold enhancement. Comparing with chemical pressure tuning of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, the Fermi surface enlarges in a similar manner but the effective masses and $T_c$ are suppressed. These differences may be attributed to the changes in the density of states influenced by the chalcogen height, which could promote stronger spin fluctuations pairing under pressure. Furthermore, our study also reveals unusual scattering and broadening of superconducting transitions in the high-pressure phase, indicating the presence of a complex pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Helical Spin Dynamics in Commensurate Magnets: a Study on Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the direct observation of a commensurate-ordered antiferromagnetic (AFM) state but incommensurate helical spin dynamics in the natural mineral brochantite Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$ through neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal magnon-like excitations with considerable dispersion along the c-axis and almost flat branches in other principal directions, indicating the strong one-dimensional character of the magnetic correlations. We experimentally observe the effect of the uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which elevates the degeneracy of the spin-wave modes shifting them in opposite directions in reciprocal space. The system has a commensurate AFM ground state, stabilized by the anisotropic symmetric Heisenberg exchange interactions, and quasi-one-dimensional chiral spin dynamics due to the antisymmetric DM interaction. Employing linear spin-wave theory, we were able to construct an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We quantify both the symmetric exchange parameters and the DM vector components in Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$ and determine the mechanism of the magnetic frustration. Our work provides detailed insights into the complex dynamics of the spin chain in the presence of uniform DM interaction.</description>

      <title>Giant anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial Mn$_{3.2}$Ge films with a cubic kagome structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first example of epitaxial Mn$_{3 + \delta}$Ge thin films with a cubic $L1_2$ structure. The films are found to exhibit frustrated ferromagnetism with an average magnetization corresponding to 0.98$~\pm~$0.06$~\mu_B$/Mn, far larger than the parasitic ferromagnetism in hexagonal Mn$_3$Ge and the partially compensated ferrimagnetism in tetragonal Mn$_3$Ge. The Hall conductivity is the largest reported for the kagome magnets with a low temperature value of $\sigma_{xy} = 1587~$S/cm. Density functional calculations predict that a chiral antiferromagnetic structure is lower in energy than a ferromagnetic configuration in an ordered stoichiometric crystal. However, chemical disorder driven by the excess Mn in our films explains why a frustrated 120$^\circ$ spin structure is not observed. Comparisons between the magnetization and the Hall resistivity indicate that a non-coplanar spin structure contributes the Hall signal. Anisotropic magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect with hysteresis up to 14 T provides further insights into this material.</description>

      <title>Integrated workflows and interfaces for data-driven semi-empirical electronic structure calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm shift from monolithic workflows towards object-based modularity. Software objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to create "deep" modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic structure codes, and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable. We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and provides data to an external workflow; and in another, DFTB+ receives data via external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+, or to enabling deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation prediction with a dual-solute model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute segregation along grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly affects their thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in polycrystalline materials. Recently, the spectral approach has emerged as a powerful tool to predict GB segregation. However, previous GB segregation predictions using this method relied heavily on single-solute segregation energy spectrum without solute-solute interactions, which were often incorporated through a fitting parameter. In this work, we developed a dual-solute model whose segregation energy spectrum intrinsically incorporates solute-solute interactions. It was first validated for GB segregation prediction in the Al-Mg system and then extended to several other distinct binary alloy systems. The dual-solute model shows significant improvement over the single-solute model and can accurately predict the real segregation states obtained by hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations within a broad temperature range with different solute concentrations before forming secondary phases. This dual-solute model provides an effective method for accurately predicting GB segregation in nanocrystalline metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examined the affection of the flux-trapped states of Sn60-Pb40 solders on superconducting properties of a Sn wire. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity at H = 0 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) showed a sharp superconducting transition at T = 3.7 K. In contrast, that after field cooling (FC) resulted in broadening of the transition. The difference between ZFC and FC data evidences critical affection of trapped fluxes at solders on superconducting states. We propose that, in electrical measurements where magnetic fields of several hundred Oe are critical, field experience should be seriously considered when using solders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated their potential as solid-state electrolytes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the number of MOFs reported to exhibit proton conductivity remains limited, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully elucidated, complicating the design of proton-conductive MOFs. In response, we developed a comprehensive database of proton-conductive MOFs and applied machine learning techniques to predict their proton conductivity. Our approach included the construction of both descriptor-based and transformer-based models. Notably, the transformer-based transfer learning (Freeze) model performed the best with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.91, suggesting that the proton conductivity of MOFs can be estimated within one order of magnitude using this model. Additionally, we employed feature importance and principal component analysis to explore the factors influencing proton conductivity. The insights gained from our database and machine learning model are expected to facilitate the targeted design of proton-conductive MOFs.</description>

Abstract: We report a case study where an existing materials science course was modified to include numerical simulation projects on the micromagnetic behavior of materials. The Ubermag micromagnetic simulation software package is used in order to solve problems computationally. The simulation software is controlled through Python code in Jupyter notebooks. Our experience is that the self-paced problem-solving nature of the project work can facilitate a better in-depth exploration of the course contents. We discuss which aspects of the Ubermag and the project Jupyter ecosystem have been beneficial for the students' learning experience and which could be transferred to similar teaching activities in other subject areas.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Coulomb Blockade as a Signature of the Sign-Reversing Cooper Pairing Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade occurs for electrons tunneling into nanoislands because of the quantization of charge. Here, using spectroscopy measurements of nonmagnetic islands grown on a high-Tc superconductor [one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe], we systematically investigate the dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB), which is found to reflect the Cooper pairing potential in the superconducting substrate. The tunneling spectra are acquired on single-crystalline Pb nanoislands and show a clear suppression of the tunnel current around zero bias-voltage with a gap-like structure. The observed spectral gaps can be attributed to DCB based on our comprehensive investigations, including experiments with finely varying island sizes and calculations of the spectra using the P(E) theory of DCB. Our detailed analysis suggests that the observed DCB can be related to the sign-reversing pairing potential in the 1-UC FeSe substrate below the islands. The sign reversal is furthermore revealed in a transition of the superconducting gap of FeSe from a U- to a V-like lineshape as the distance between neighboring doublet islands is decreased, indicating the presence of a nodal-like gap as expected for a sign-reversing superconductor. Our configuration of nonmagnetic nanoislands on a high-Tc superconductor for spectroscopy measurements may serve as a local, spatially sensitive, and tunable probe for detecting the sign-reversing order parameter in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study of strongly curved graphene magnetization and magnetic susceptibility is carried out. Through a Dirac model complemented with a tight-binding model analysis, we are able to show that mechanical deformations solve the long-standing problem of graphene's theoretically calculated diamagnetic divergence at low temperatures. This suggests that corrugations and mechanical defects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an electronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) effect. This effect is related to oscillating (electronic) forces that oppose deformations; these forces are divergent in flat graphene, indicating that graphene (without substrate) achieves mechanical equilibrium by corrugations. In addition, paramagnetism is predicted for graphene with negative curvature under strong magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>
