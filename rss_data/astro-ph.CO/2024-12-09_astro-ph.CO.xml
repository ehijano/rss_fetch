      <title>A compact group lens modeled with GIGA-Lens: Enhanced inference for complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large-scale astronomical surveys, fast modeling of strong lens systems has become increasingly vital. While significant progress has been made for galaxy-scale lenses, the development of automated methods for modeling larger systems, such as groups and clusters, is not as extensive. Our study aims to extend the capabilities of the GIGA-Lens code, enhancing its efficiency in modeling multi-galaxy strong lens systems. We focus on demonstrating the potential of GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference in handling complex lensing scenarios with a high number of free parameters. We employ an improved inference approach that combines image position and pixelated data with an annealing sampling technique to obtain the posterior distribution of complex models. This method allows us to overcome the challenge of limited prior information, a high number of parameters, and memory usage. Our process is exemplified through the analysis of the compact group lens system DES J0248-3955, for which we present VLT/X-shooter spectra. We measure a redshift of $z = 0.69 \pm 0.04$ for the group, and $z = 1.2722 \pm 0.0005$ for one of the extended arcs. Our enhanced method successfully constrained a lens model with 29 free parameters and lax priors in a remarkably short time. The mass of the lens is well described by a single dark-matter halo with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v = (690 \pm 30) \, km \, s^{-1}$. The model predicts the presence of a second source at the same redshift and a third source at approximately $z \sim 2.7$. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our lens modeling technique for dealing with a complex system in a short time using ground-based data. This presents considerable potential within the context of large surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hubble constant through the galaxy pairwise peculiar velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$, the current expansion rate of the universe, is one of the most important parameters in cosmology. The cosmic expansion regulates the mutually approaching motion of a pair of celestial objects due to their gravity. Therefore, the mean pairwise peculiar velocity of celestial objects, which quantifies their relative motion, is sensitive to both $H_0$ and the dimensionless total matter density $\Omega_m$. Based on this, using the Cosmicflows-4 data, we measured $H_0$ for the first time via the galaxy pairwise velocity in the nonlinear and quasi-linear range. Our results yield $H_0=75.5\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.311^{+0.029}_{-0.028}$ . The uncertainties of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ can be improved to around 0.6% and 2%, respectively, if the statistical errors become negligible in the future.</description>

      <title>Testing $f(R)$ Gravity from Cosmic Shear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a detailed analysis to constrain the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, using cosmic shear data from three prominent Stage-III weak lensing surveys: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000, and HSC-Y3. To accurately model the nonlinear matter clustering in the analysis of cosmic shear signals, we employ FREmu, a recently developed power spectrum emulator for the $f(R)$ gravity trained on the Quijote-MG simulations. This emulator achieves precise predictions, limiting the errors to 5% on scales of $0.009h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.5h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our findings reveal that cosmic shear data alone impose only weak constraints on the $f(R)$ parameter $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}|$. To improve these constraints, we incorporate state-of-the-art external observations, including data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. The inclusion of these external datasets significantly enhances the constraints, yielding an upper limit of $\log_{10}|f_{R_0}| &lt; -4.79$ at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on dark energy models using DESI BAO 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a potential deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Some studies suggest that the data points from the luminous red galaxies (LRG) survey in DESI BAO data may contribute to this discrepancy. In this work, our main goal is to investigate whether this deviation is caused by the parameterization of the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE). Hence, we have examined four popular parameterized dark energy models in our analysis: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and Feng-Shen-Li-Li (FSLL) parameterizations. Considering that LRG1 and LRG2 data points may lead to deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, we use two versions of DESI BAO data, differing in whether these data points are included. Additionally, to break the parameter degeneracies and obtain robust constraint results, we introduce Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and quasars (QSO) in our analysis. Our findings indicate that in these parameterizations, the deviation from ($w_0$,$w_{1}$)=(-1,0) becomes more pronounced when using the combined data from DESI BAO, SNe Ia, and QSO compilations. Here, $w_{0}$ and $w_{1}$ represent the EoS of DE. It suggests that the parameterizations of the EoS of DE have little impact on the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Besides, our analysis potentially hints that dark energy may have dynamic properties. In addition, the results obtained from different BAO datasets demonstrate that the LRG1 and LRG2 data points do indeed contribute to a deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, according to the statistical criteria, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the joint constraints provide substantial observational support to the BA and FSLL models.</description>

      <title>PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Galaxy Field Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Myrzakulov Gravity in Vielbein Formalism: A Study in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand gravity's role in shaping the universe has led to the exploration of modified gravity theories. One such theory is Myrzakulov gravity, which incorporates both curvature and torsion. In this work, we investigate the effects of torsion within the framework of $f(R,T)$-gravity, a modification of General Relativity that includes both curvature and torsion. We present this theory in the Vielbein formalism, which offers a more flexible, geometric perspective on gravity. This formalism is particularly useful in Weitzenb"ock spacetime, where torsion significantly influences gravitational interactions. Our study aims to extend Myrzakulov's theory and explore its cosmological and astrophysical implications. We examine the effects of torsion on phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves, and neutron stars. These modifications could lead to observable deviations in black hole thermodynamics, gravitational wave propagation, and dense matter structure. This work provides new insights into the nature of spacetime and gravity, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental forces governing the cosmos. It paves the way for future studies, both observational and theoretical, that could reveal new physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Fading Light, Fierce Winds: JWST Snapshot of a Sub-Eddington Quasar at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at $z\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds ($\nu\sim10^4~{\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion $\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio ($\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annual Modulation Analysis with Combined Nuclear and Electron Recoil Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decades of experimental efforts, the DAMA/LIBRA(DL) annual modulation (AM) analysis on the ${\chi}$N (WIMP Dark Matter interactions on nucleus) channel remains the only one which can be interpreted as positive signatures. This has been refuted by numerous time-integrated (TI) and AM analysis. It has been shown that ${\chi}$e (WIMP interactions with electrons) alone is not compatible with the DL AM data. We expand the investigations by performing an AM analysis with the addition of ${\chi}$e long-range and short-range interactions to ${\chi}$N, derived using the frozen-core approximation method. Two scenarios are considered, where the ${\chi}$N and ${\chi}$e processes are due to a single ${\chi}$ (${\Gamma}^{1\chi}_{tot}$) or two different ${\chi}$s (${\Gamma}^{2\chi}_{tot}$). The combined fits with ${\chi}$N and ${\chi}$e provide stronger significance to the DL AM data which are compatible with the presence of additional physical effects beyond \c{hi}N alone. This is the first analysis which explores how ${\chi}$e AM can play a role in DL AM. The revised allowed regions as well as the exclusion contours from the other null AM experiments are presented. All DL AM allowed parameter spaces in ${\chi}$N and ${\chi}$e channels under both ${\Gamma}^{1\chi}_{tot}$ and ${\Gamma}^{2\chi}_{tot}$ are excluded at the 90\% confidence level by the combined null AM results. It can be projected that DL-allowed parameter spaces from generic models with interactions induced by two-WIMPs are ruled out.</description>

      <title>Differential age observations and their constraining power in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the differential age signal valid for cosmic chronometers (passively evolving galaxies) in any space-time that satisfies the following assumptions: (i) The space-time has a metric with Lorentzian signature and the connection is the Levi-Civita connection; (ii) the cosmic chronometers are collectively well approximated as a geodesic and irrotational congruence of time-like worldlines in the space-time; (iii) light travels on null geodesics and caustics on the observer's past light cone can be ignored; (iv) the space-time is cosmological, meaning that isotropic and positive expansion degrees-of-freedom dominate over anisotropic and negative expansion degrees-of-freedom when viewed on sufficiently large scales in the frame of the cosmic chronometers. The main result of the paper is an expression for the differential age signal that is written in terms of line-of-sight averages of the expansion rate along individual null lines, thus providing a kinematic interpretation of the differential age signal applicable to cosmological space-times satisfying (i)--(iv). We explain how this result indicates that the differential age signal is a robust probe of the volume-average expansion rate in very general statistically homogeneous and isotropic space-time scenarios where other probes of the volume-average expansion rate tend to yield biased results. We argue that this unique property of the differential age signal makes it an ideal measurement for constraining the expansion history model-independently.</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>

      <title>Fast Likelihood-free Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (${\it blind}$ reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (${\it template}$ reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools are integrated into the package ${\tt GWBackFinder}$, which is publicly available in https://github.com/AndronikiDimitriou/GWBackFinder.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction and evolution of black holes in cosmological simulations: a new implementation in OpenGadget3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a sub-resolution prescription for the unresolved dynamical friction onto black holes (BHs) in the OpenGadget3 code. We carry out cosmological simulations of a volume of 16 cMpc3 and zoom-ins of a galaxy group and of a galaxy cluster. The advantages of our new technique are assessed in comparison to commonly adopted methods to hamper spurious BH displacements, i.e. repositioning onto a local minimum of the gravitational potential and ad-hoc boosting of the BH particle dynamical mass. The newly-introduced dynamical friction correction provides centering of BHs on host halos which is at least comparable with the other techniques. It predicts half as many merger events with respect to the repositioning prescription, with the advantage of being less prone to leave sub-structures without any central BH. Simulations featuring our dynamical friction prescription produce a smaller (by up to 50% with respect to repositioning) population of wandering BHs and final BH masses in good agreement with observations. As for individual BH-BH interactions, our dynamical friction model captures the gradual inspiraling of orbits before the merger occurs. By contrast, the repositioning scheme, in its most classical renditions considered, describes extremely fast mergers, while the dynamical mass misrepresents the BHs' dynamics, introducing numerical scattering between the orbiting BHs. Given its performances in describing the centering of BHs within host galaxies and the orbiting of BH pair before their merging, our dynamical friction correction opens interesting applications for an accurate description of the evolution of BH demography within cosmological simulations of galaxy formation at different cosmic epochs and within different environments.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical systematics in Kinematic Lensing: quantifying an Intrinsic Alignment analog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinematic lensing (KL) is a new weak lensing technique that reduces shape noise for disk galaxies by including spectroscopically measured galaxy kinematics in addition to photometrically measured galaxy shapes. Since KL utilizes the Tully-Fisher relation, any correlation of this relation with the local environment may bias the cosmological interpretation. For the first time, we explore such a Tully-Fisher environmental dependence (TED) effect as a potential astrophysical systematic for KL. Our derivation of the TED systematic can be described in a similar analytical form as intrinsic alignment for traditional weak lensing. We demonstrate analytically that TED only impacts KL if intrinsic aligment for disk galaxies is non-zero. We further use IllustrisTNG simulations to quantify the TED effect. Our two-point correlation measurements do not yield any additional coherent signals that would indicate a systematic bias on KL, within the uncertainties set by the simulation volume.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Dust Bouncing Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear scalar cosmological perturbations have increasing spectra in the contracting phase of bouncing models. We study the conditions for which these perturbations may collapse into primordial black holes and the hypothesis that these objects constitute a fraction of dark matter. We compute the critical density contrast that describes the collapse of matter perturbations in the flat-dust bounce model with a parametric solution, obtained from the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that represents the spherical collapse. We discuss the inability of the Newtonian gauge to describe perturbations in contracting models as the perturbative hypothesis does not hold in such cases. We carry the calculations for a different Gauge choice and compute the perturbations power spectra numerically. Finally, assuming a Gaussian distribution, we compute the primordial black hole abundance with the Press-Schechter formalism and compare it with observational constraints. From our analysis, we conclude that the primordial black hole formation in a dust-dominated contracting phase does not lead to a significant mass fraction of primordial black holes in dark matter today.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from inflation in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various scenarios of cosmic inflation enhance the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at frequencies detectable by the LISA detector. We develop tools for a template-based analysis of the SGWB and introduce a template databank to describe well-motivated signals from inflation, prototype their template-based searches, and forecast their reconstruction with LISA. Specifically, we classify seven templates based on their signal frequency shape, and we identify representative fundamental physics models leading to them. By running a template-based analysis, we forecast the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the template parameters of representative benchmark signals, with and without galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We identify the parameter regions that can be probed by LISA within each template. Finally, we investigate how our signal reconstructions shed light on fundamental physics models of inflation: we discuss their impact for measurements of \emph{e.g.,} ~the couplings of inflationary axions to gauge fields; the graviton mass during inflation; the fluctuation seeds of primordial black holes; the consequences of excited states during inflation, and the presence of small-scale spectral features.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 10 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>

Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 8 hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography: Bayesian reconstruction of the galaxy density informed by large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark sirens method combines gravitational waves and catalogs of galaxies to constrain the cosmological expansion history, merger rates and mass distributions of compact objects, and the laws of gravity. However, the incompleteness of galaxy catalogs means faint potential host galaxies are unobserved, and must be modeled to avoid inducing a bias. The majority of dark sirens analyses to date assume that the missing galaxies are distributed uniformly across the sky, which is clearly unphysical. We introduce a new Bayesian approach to the reconstruction of galaxy catalogs, which makes full use of our knowledge of large-scale structure. Our method quantifies the uncertainties on the estimated true galaxy number count in each voxel, and is marginalized over cosmological parameters and bias parameters. Crucially, our method further assesses the (absolute) magnitude distribution of galaxies, which is not known from the galaxy catalog itself. We present the details of our method and validate our approach on a galaxy catalog associated to the Millennium Simulation. The tools developed here generate physically-informed and robust host galaxy reconstructions, enabling more informative dark sirens analyses. Stage IV galaxy surveys will display greater redshift overlap with GW observations, whilst remaining incomplete -- emphasizing the importance of our work.</description>

      <title>A doublet of cosmological models to challenge the H0 tension in the Pantheon Supernovae Ia catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM provides a leading framework in the interpretation of modern cosmology. Nevertheless, the scientific community still struggles with many open problems in cosmology. Among the most noticeable ones, the tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$ is particularly intriguing, prompting a wide range of possible solutions. In the present work, the flat scale-free cosmology ($S$CDM) of Maeder (2017) is tested for $H_0$ tension in fits to the Pantheon sample of Supernovae Ia. The Pantheon sample is a collection of 1048 SNe Ia, which formally defines $H_0=H(0)$ by extrapolation to redshift zero of data over positive redshifts $z&gt;0$. Here, we consider $H_{0,k}$ in fits of $S$CDM over $k$ equally sized bins of sub-samples of mean redshift $z_k$. To quantify a trend in $H_{0,k}$ with $z_k$, the results are fit by $f(z)=H'_0/(1+z)^\alpha$ in the two parameters $H'_0$ and $\alpha$. This approach tests for model imperfections or data biases by trends that are inconsistent with zero. Our findings show a decreasing trend inconsistent with zero at $5.3 \sigma$ significance, significantly more so than in $\Lambda$CDM. These results are further confirmed in Pantheon+. It appears that a solution to $H_0$ tension is to be found in models with a deceleration parameter $q_0&lt;q_{0,\Lambda}$ below that of $\Lambda$CDM, rather than $q_{0,\Lambda} &lt; q_{0,S}&lt;0$ satisfied by $S$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a major upgrade to the existing PandaX-4T experiment in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The new experiment, PandaX-xT, will be a multi-ten-tonne liquid xenon, ultra-low background, and general-purpose observatory. The full-scaled PandaX-xT contains a 43-tonne liquid xenon active target. Such an experiment will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of particle physics and astrophysics. The sensitivity of dark matter direct detection will be improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to the current best limits, approaching the so-called "neutrino floor" for a dark matter mass above 10 GeV/$c^2$, providing a decisive test to the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle paradigm. By searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe isotope in the detector, the effective Majorana neutrino mass can be measured to a [10 -- 41] meV/$c^2$ sensitivity, providing a key test to the Dirac/Majorana nature of neutrino s. Astrophysical neutrinos and other ultra-rare interactions can also be measured and searched for with an unprecedented background level, opening up new windows of discovery. Depending on the findings, PandaX-xT will seek the next stage upgrade utilizing isotopic separation on natural xenon.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering three phenomenological, regular tr (time-radial)-symmetric space-times (including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones), featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For all three metrics we find that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by potentially an order of magnitude or more, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is devoted to non-\textit{tr}-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>A determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature using Galactic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18270</link>

Abstract: We report a new, reliable determination of the CN excitation temperature of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way, based on ultra high spectral resolution observations. Our determination is based on CN $B^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) vibronic absorption spectra seen along the lines of sight to eight bright Galactic stars. Our analysis is conducted blind, and we account for multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Like previous studies, our excitation temperature measures exhibit an intrinsic scatter that exceeds the quoted uncertainties. Accounting for this scatter, we derive a 3% determination of the typical CN excitation temperature, $T_{01}=2.769^{+0.084}_{-0.072}~{\rm K}$, which is consistent with the direct determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We also perform a single joint fit to all sightlines, and find that our data can be simultaneously fit with an excitation temperature $T_{01}=2.725\pm0.015~{\rm K}$ -- a 0.55% measure that is consistent with the CMB temperature. We propose a future observational strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties and firmly test the limitations of using CN as a cosmic microwave background thermometer.</description>
