      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>On The Heine-Borel Property and Minimum Enclosing Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute a proof that minimum radius balls over metric spaces with the Heine-Borel property are always LP type. Additionally, we prove that weak metric spaces, those without symmetry, also have this property if we fix the direction in which we take their distances from the centers of the balls. We use this to prove that the minimum radius ball problem is LP type in the Hilbert and Thompson metrics and Funk weak metric. In doing so, we contribute a proof that the topology induced by the Thompson metric coincides with the Hilbert. We provide explicit primitives for computing the minimum radius ball in the Hilbert metric.</description>

      <title>Translational Aperiodic Sets of 7 Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, two extraordinary results on aperiodic monotiles have been obtained in two different settings. One is a family of aperiodic monotiles in the plane discovered by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss in 2023, where rotation is allowed, breaking the 50-year-old record (aperiodic sets of two tiles found by Roger Penrose in the 1970s) on the minimum size of aperiodic sets in the plane. The other is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in the translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for some huge dimension $n$ proved by Greenfeld and Tao. This disproves the long-standing periodic tiling conjecture. However, it is known that there is no aperiodic monotile for translational tiling of the plane. The smallest size of known aperiodic sets for translational tilings of the plane is $8$, which was discovered more than $30$ years ago by Ammann. In this paper, we prove that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $7$ polyominoes is undecidable. As a consequence of the undecidability, we have constructed a family of aperiodic sets of size $7$ for the translational tiling of the plane. This breaks the 30-year-old record of Ammann.</description>

      <title>Maximum Centre-Disjoint Mergeable Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of disks in the plane, the goal of the problem studied in this paper is to choose a subset of these disks such that none of its members contains the centre of any other. Each disk not in this subset must be merged with one of its nearby disks that is, increasing the latter's radius. This problem has applications in labelling rotating maps and in visualizing the distribution of entities in static maps. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We also present an ILP formulation for this problem, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case in which the centres of all disks are on a line.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Interleaving Distance for Mapper Graphs with a Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15130v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data consisting of a graph with a function mapping into $\mathbb{R}^d$ arise in many data applications, encompassing structures such as Reeb graphs, geometric graphs, and knot embeddings. As such, the ability to compare and cluster such objects is required in a data analysis pipeline, leading to a need for distances between them. In this work, we study the interleaving distance on discretization of these objects, called mapper graphs when $d=1$, where functor representations of the data can be compared by finding pairs of natural transformations between them. However, in many cases, computation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard. For this reason, we take inspiration from recent work by Robinson to find quality measures for families of maps that do not rise to the level of a natural transformation, called assignments. We then endow the functor images with the extra structure of a metric space and define a loss function which measures how far an assignment is from making the required diagrams of an interleaving commute. Finally we show that the computation of the loss function is polynomial with a given assignment. We believe this idea is both powerful and translatable, with the potential to provide approximations and bounds on interleavings in a broad array of contexts.</description>

      <title>Approximation Schemes for Geometric Knapsack for Packing Spheres and Fat Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric knapsack problem in which we are given a set of $d$-dimensional objects (each with associated profits) and the goal is to find the maximum profit subset that can be packed non-overlappingly into a given $d$-dimensional (unit hypercube) knapsack. Even if $d=2$ and all input objects are disks, this problem is known to be \textsf{NP}-hard [Demaine, Fekete, Lang, 2010]. In this paper, we give polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the following types of input objects in any constant dimension $d$:
  - disks and hyperspheres,
  - a class of fat convex polygons that generalizes regular $k$-gons for $k\ge 5$ (formally, polygons
  with a constant number of edges, whose lengths are in a bounded range, and in which each angle is strictly larger than $\pi/2$),
  - arbitrary fat convex objects that are sufficiently small compared to the knapsack.
  We remark that in our \textsf{PTAS} for disks and hyperspheres, we output the computed set of objects, but for a $O_\varepsilon(1)$ of them, we determine their coordinates only up to an exponentially small error. However, it is unclear whether there always exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution that uses only rational coordinates for the disks' centers. We leave this as an open problem that is related to well-studied geometric questions in the realm of circle packing.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Hexahedral Mesh Optimization via Augmented Lagrangian, L-BFGS, and Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new software package, ``HexOpt,'' for improving the quality of all-hexahedral (all-hex) meshes by maximizing the minimum mixed scaled Jacobian-Jacobian energy functional, and projecting the surface points of the all-hex meshes onto the input triangular mesh. The proposed HexOpt method takes as input a surface triangular mesh and a volumetric all-hex mesh. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to improve mesh quality using a novel function that combines Jacobian and scaled Jacobian metrics which are rectified and scaled to quadratic measures, while preserving the surface geometry. This optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, where the Lagrangian terms enforce the constraint that surface points must remain on the triangular mesh. Specifically, corner points stay exactly at the corner, edge points are confined to the edges, and face points are free to move across the surface. To take the advantage of the Quasi-Newton method while tackling the high-dimensional variable problem, the Limited-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is employed. The step size for each iteration is determined by the Armijo line search. Coupled with smart Laplacian smoothing, HexOpt has demonstrated robustness and efficiency, successfully applying to 3D models and hex meshes generated by different methods without requiring any manual intervention or parameter adjustment.</description>
