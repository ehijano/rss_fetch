      <title>Coordinated Frequency Regulation in Grid-Forming Storage Network via Safety-Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverter-based storages are poised to play a prominent role in future power grids with massive renewable generation. Grid-forming inverters (GFMs) are emerging as a dominant technology with synchronous generators (SG)-like characteristics through primary control loops. Advanced secondary control schemes, e.g., consensus algorithms, allow GFM-interfaced storage units to participate in frequency regulations and restore nominal frequency following grid disturbances. However, it is imperative to ensure transient frequency excursions do not violate critical safety limits while the grid transitions from pre- to post-disturbance operating point. This paper presents a hierarchical safety-enforced consensus method -- combining a device-layer (decentralized) transient safety filter with a secondary-layer (distributed) consensus coordination -- to achieve three distinct objectives: limiting transient frequency excursions to safe limits, minimizing frequency deviations from nominal, and ensuring coordinated power sharing among GFM-storage units. The proposed hierarchical (two-layered) safety-consensus technique is illustrated using a GFM-interfaced storage network on an IEEE 68-bus system under multiple grid transient scenarios.</description>

      <title>Frequency Control and Disturbance Containment Using Grid-Forming Embedded Storage Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses fast frequency control in bulk power systems using embedded networks of grid-forming energy storage resources. Differing from their traditional roles of regulating reserves, the storage resources in this work operate as fast-acting grid assets shaping transient dynamics. The storage resources in the network are autonomously controlled using local measurements for distributed frequency support during disturbance events. Further, the grid-forming inverter systems interfacing with the storage resources, are augmented with fast-acting safety controls designed to contain frequency transients within a prescribed tolerance band. The control action, derived from the storage network, improves the frequency nadirs in the system and prevents the severity of a disturbance from propagating far from the source. The paper also presents sensitivity studies to evaluate the impacts of storage capacity and inverter controller parameters on the dynamic performance of frequency control and disturbance localization. The performance of the safety-constrained grid-forming control is also compared with the more common grid-following control. The results are illustrated through case studies on an IEEE test system.</description>

      <title>Differential Predictive Control of Residential Building HVACs for Maximizing Renewable Local Consumption and Supporting Fast Voltage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High penetration of distributed energy resources in distribution systems, such as rooftop solar PVs, has caused voltage fluctuations which are much faster than typical voltage control devices can react to, leading to increased operation cost and reduced equipment life. Residential buildings consume about 35% of the electricity in U.S. and are co-located with rooftop solar PV. Thus, they present an opportunity to mitigate these fluctuations locally, while benefiting both the grid and building owners. Previous works on DER-aware localized building energy management mostly focus on commercial buildings and analyzing impacts either on buildings or the grid. To fill the gaps, this paper proposes a distributed, differential predictive control scheme for residential HVAC systems for maximizing renewable local consumption. In addition, a detailed controller-building-grid co-simulation platform is developed and utilized for analyzing the potential impacts of the proposed control scheme on both the buildings and distribution system. Our studies show that the proposed method can provide benefits to both the buildings' owners and the distribution system by reducing energy draw from the grid by 12%, voltage violations and fast fluctuations by 20%, and the number of tap changes in voltage regulators by 14%.</description>

      <title>Grid-Forming Control of Modular Dynamic Virtual Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores a flexible and coordinated control design for an aggregation of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs) in a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP). The control design aims to provide a desired aggregate grid-forming (GFM) response based on the coordination of power contributions between different DERs. Compared to existing DVPP designs with an AC-coupled AC-output configuration, a more generic modular DVPP design is proposed in this article, which comprises four types of basic DVPP modules, involving AC- or DC-coupling and AC- or DC-output, adequately accommodating diverse DER integration setups, such as AC, DC, AC/DC hybrid microgrids and renewable power plants. The control design is first developed for the four basic modules by the aggregation of DERs and the disaggregation of the control objectives, and then extended to modular DVPPs through a systematic top-down approach. The control performance is comprehensively validated through simulation. The modular DVPP design offers scalable and standardizable advanced grid interfaces (AGIs) for building and operating AC/DC hybrid power grids.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Individualized Incentives from Grid Measurements and Limited Knowledge of Agent Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As electrical generation becomes more distributed and volatile, and loads become more uncertain, controllability of distributed energy resources (DERs), regardless of their ownership status, will be necessary for grid reliability. Grid operators lack direct control over end-users' grid interactions, such as energy usage, but incentives can influence behavior -- for example, an end-user that receives a grid-driven incentive may adjust their consumption or expose relevant control variables in response. A key challenge in studying such incentives is the lack of data about human behavior, which usually motivates strong assumptions, such as distributional assumptions on compliance or rational utility-maximization. In this paper, we propose a general incentive mechanism in the form of a constrained optimization problem -- our approach is distinguished from prior work by modeling human behavior (e.g., reactions to an incentive) as an arbitrary unknown function. We propose feedback-based optimization algorithms to solve this problem that each leverage different amounts of information and/or measurements. We show that each converges to an asymptotically stable incentive with (near)-optimality guarantees given mild assumptions on the problem. Finally, we evaluate our proposed techniques in voltage regulation simulations on standard test beds. We test a variety of settings, including those that break assumptions required for theoretical convergence (e.g., convexity, smoothness) to capture realistic settings. In this evaluation, our proposed algorithms are able to find near-optimal incentives even when the reaction to an incentive is modeled by a theoretically difficult (yet realistic) function.</description>

      <title>EDRF: Enhanced Driving Risk Field Based on Multimodal Trajectory Prediction and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving risk assessment is crucial for both autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Hedge Algebra Controller using Recursive Semantic Values for Cart-pole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to designing a Hedge Algebra Controller named Hedge Algebra Controller with Recursive Semantic Values (RS-HAC). This approach incorporates several newly introduced concepts, including Semantically Quantifying Simplified Mapping (SQSM) featuring a recursive algorithm, Infinite General Semantization (IGS), and Infinite General De-semantization (IGDS). These innovations aim to enhance the optimizability, scalability, and flexibility of hedge algebra theory, allowing the design of a hedge algebra-based controller to be carried out more efficiently and straightforward. An application of stabilizing an inverted pendulum on a cart is conducted to illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Comparisons are made between RS-HAC and a fuzzy controller of Takagi-Sugeno type (FC), as well as a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The results indicate that the RS-HAC surpasses the FC by up to 400\% in control efficiency and is marginally better than the LQR regarding transient time in balancing an inverted pendulum on a cart.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Nigeria's Power Sector with and without Grid-Scale Storage: Future Implications for Emission and Renewable Energy Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a framework for modeling and comparing two electricity scenarios for Nigeria by 2050, focusing on the inclusion and exclusion of electricity storage technologies. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to generate a design matrix for data collection, with EnergyPLAN software used to create energy system simulations on the CCD data for four outputs: total annual cost, CO2 emissions, critical excess electricity production (CEEP), and electricity import. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were tuned using Bayesian optimization to develop models mapping the inputs to outputs. A genetic algorithm was employed for multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal input capacities that minimize the outputs. Results indicated that incorporating electricity storage technologies (EST) leads to a 37% increase in renewable electricity sources (RES) share, resulting in a 19.14% reduction in CO2 emissions. EST such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro storage (PHS), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage allow for the storage of the critical excess electricity that comes with increasing RES share. Integrating EST in Nigeria's 2050 energy landscape is crucial for incorporating more renewable electricity sources into the energy system, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and managing excess electricity production. This study outlines a plan for optimal electricity production to meet Nigeria's 2050 demand, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that combines fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear power, and advanced storage solutions to achieve a sustainable and efficient electricity system.</description>

      <title>Multi-class within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium with strategic travel time information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most research on within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium with information provision implicitly considers travel time information, often assuming information to be perfect or imperfect based on travelers' perception error. However, lacking explicit formulation of information limits insightful analysis of information impact on dynamic traffic equilibrium and the potential benefits of leveraging information provision to improve system-level performance. To address this gap, this paper proposes a within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium model that explicitly formulates strategic information provision as an endogenous element. In the proposed framework, two classes of travelers receive different types of travel time information: one class receives instantaneous travel time reflecting the prevailing traffic conditions, while the other class receives strategic forecasts of travel times, generated by accounting for travelers' reactions to instantaneous information based on strategic thinking from behavioral game theory. The resulting multi-class within-day dynamic equilibrium differs from existing models by explicitly modeling information provision and consideration of information consistency. The inherent dynamics of real-time updated traffic information, traffic conditions, and travelers' choice behaviors are analytically modeled, with the resulting dynamic equilibrium formulated as a fixed-point problem. The theoretical propositions and numerical findings offer rich insights into the impact of information on the traffic network, strategic forecast information penetration, the relationship between the proposed equilibrium and traditional dynamic traffic equilibria, and information accuracy. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between information and traffic dynamics, paving the way for more effective traffic management strategies.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Primal-Dual Method for Constrained Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with General Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel distributed approach for solving a cooperative Constrained Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (CMARL) problem, where agents seek to minimize a global objective function subject to shared constraints. Unlike existing methods that rely on centralized training or coordination, our approach enables fully decentralized online learning, with each agent maintaining local estimates of both primal and dual variables. Specifically, we develop a distributed primal-dual algorithm based on actor-critic methods, leveraging local information to estimate Lagrangian multipliers. We establish consensus among the Lagrangian multipliers across agents and prove the convergence of our algorithm to an equilibrium point, analyzing the sub-optimality of this equilibrium compared to the exact solution of the unparameterized problem. Furthermore, we introduce a constrained cooperative Cournot game with stochastic dynamics as a test environment to evaluate the algorithm's performance in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Global Coordinate-Free Approach to Invariant Contraction on Homogeneous Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a global condition for contraction with respect to an invariant Riemannian metric on reductive homogeneous spaces. Using left-invariant frames, vector fields on the manifold are horizontally lifted to the ambient Lie group, where the Levi-Civita connection is globally characterized as a real matrix multiplication. By linearizing in these left-invariant frames, we characterize contraction using matrix measures on real square matrices, avoiding the use of local charts. Applying this global condition, we provide a necessary condition for a prescribed subset of the manifold to possibly admit a contracting system with respect to an invariant metric. Applied to the sphere, this condition implies that no closed hemisphere can be contained in a contraction region. Finally, we apply our results to compute reachable sets for an attitude control problem.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Prediction-Based Safe Control for Coupled Controllable and Uncontrollable Agents with Conformal Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of safe control synthesis for systems operating in environments with uncontrollable agents whose dynamics are unknown but coupled with those of the controlled system. This scenario naturally arises in various applications, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration, where the behavior of uncontrollable agents, like pedestrians, cannot be directly controlled but is influenced by the actions of the autonomous vehicle or robot. In this paper, we present SPARC (Safe Prediction-Based Robust Controller for Coupled Agents), a novel framework designed to ensure safe control in the presence of coupled uncontrollable agents. SPARC leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in data-driven prediction of agent behavior. Particularly, we introduce a joint distribution-based approach to account for the coupled dynamics of the controlled system and uncontrollable agents. By integrating the control barrier function (CBF) technique, SPARC provides provable safety guarantees at a high confidence level. We illustrate our framework with a case study involving an autonomous driving scenario with walking pedestrians.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering with Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step to be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called Gaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on certain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors. To address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps of Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose optimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is observed that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating the first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that step in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of linearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an iterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid linearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the Gaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher information matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the curvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment matching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for nonlinear systems called Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO filter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time step. The estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for nearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a supermartingale-like inequality across consecutive time steps.</description>

      <title>A New Method For Flushing of Subsea Production Systems Prior to Decommissioning or Component Disconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines a novel subsea flushing system which uses a subsea tool to improve the performance of the flushing operation. The new method outlined in this paper uses a small-diameter, high-pressure supply line and a subsea deployed tool containing a pump which recirculates the cleaning fluid through the component or system to be retrieved. The main benefit of this method when compared against conventional practices is that it allows achieving higher fluid speeds inside the subsea equipment being flushed, while injecting smaller flow rates from the surface vessel. The high fluid speeds are achieved with the recirculation pump. The higher fluid speeds ensure efficient sweeping of hydrocarbons from complex paths. A reduced flow rate from the surface vessel also allows a small diameter high pressure supply line to be used, which allows for reduced weight and storage. The study is a numerical simulation of the method applied to a subsea jumper geometry. The injection flow rates required to achieve an efficient flushing were determined from previous experimental work. Calculations were made to estimate the pressure and power requirements for performing the flushing operation as well as the design requirements for the supply line concerning dimensions, material properties and the storage space needed on the support vessel. The performance of the proposed novel system was compared to that of conventional flushing systems. As environmental concerns increase, the presented method has the potential to make the flushing process more efficient while reducing costs associated with support vessels and the materials needed. The novel system may also be deployed using a low-cost Inspection Maintenance and Repair (IMR) vessel. The subsea tool is connected to the subsea production system, either through dedicated connection ports or using pipe clamp connectors with pipe wall penetrators.</description>

      <title>Lossless optimal transient control for rigid bodies in 3D space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a control scheme for rigid bodies designed to optimise transient behaviors. The search space for the optimal control input is parameterized to yield a passive, specifically lossless, nonlinear feedback controller. As a result, it can be combined with other stabilizing controllers without compromising the stability of the closed-loop system. The controller commands torques generating fictitious gyroscopic effects characteristics of 3D rotational rigid body motions, and as such does not inject nor extract kinetic energy from the system. We validate the controller in simulation using a model predictive control (MPC) scheme, successfully combining stability and performance in a stabilization task with obstacle avoidance constraints.</description>

      <title>Fast Physics-Informed Model Predictive Control Approximation for Lyapunov Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the forefront of control techniques is Model Predictive Control (MPC). While MPCs are effective, their requisite to recompute an optimal control given a new state leads to sparse response to the system and may make their implementation infeasible in small systems with low computational resources. To address these limitations in stability control, this research presents a small deterministic Physics-Informed MPC Surrogate model (PI-MPCS). PI-MPCS was developed to approximate the control by an MPC while encouraging stability and robustness through the integration of the system dynamics and the formation of a Lyapunov stability profile. Empirical results are presented on the task of 2D quadcopter landing. They demonstrate a rapid and precise MPC approximation on a non-linear system along with an estimated two times speed up on the computational requirements when compared against an MPC. PI-MPCS, in addition, displays a level of stable control for in- and out-of-distribution states as encouraged by the discrete dynamics residual and Lyapunov stability loss functions. PI-MPCS is meant to serve as a surrogate to MPC on situations in which the computational resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetics Model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Capturing Saturation and Temperature Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16240v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear magnetics model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) that accurately captures the effects of magnetic saturation in the machine iron and variations in rotor temperature on the permanent magnet excitation. The proposed model considers the permanent magnet as a current source rather than the more commonly used flux-linkage source. A comparison of the two modelling approaches is conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for different machine designs as well as experimental validation, where it is shown that the proposed model has substantially better accuracy. The proposed model decouples magnetic saturation and rotor temperature effects in the current/flux-linkage relationship, allowing for adaptive estimation of the PM excitation.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Grasping Control of Soft Robotic Grippers based on Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper has proposed a Digital Twin (DT) framework for real-time motion and pose control of soft robotic grippers. The developed DT is based on an industrial robot workstation, integrated with our newly proposed approach for soft gripper control, primarily based on computer vision, for setting the driving pressure for desired gripper status in real-time. Knowing the gripper motion, the gripper parameters (e.g. curvatures and bending angles, etc.) are simulated by kinematics modelling in Unity 3D, which is based on four-piecewise constant curvature kinematics. The mapping in between the driving pressure and gripper parameters is achieved by implementing OpenCV based image processing algorithms and data fitting. Results show that our DT-based approach can achieve satisfactory performance in real-time control of soft gripper manipulation, which can satisfy a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimal control for distributed delay differential equations: A simultaneous approach based on linearization of the delayed variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industrial processes, and they must be accounted for when designing control algorithms because they have a significant effect on the process dynamics. Therefore, in this work, we propose a simultaneous approach for numerical optimal control of delay differential equations with distributed time delays. Specifically, we linearize the delayed variables around the current time, and we discretize the resulting implicit differential equations using Euler's implicit method. Furthermore, we transcribe the infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program, which we solve using Matlab's fmincon. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach using a numerical example involving a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Optimistic Policy Iteration For Multi-Agent MDPs with Kullback-Leibler Control Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based optimistic policy iteration (OPI) scheme for learning stationary optimal stochastic policies in multi-agent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), in which agents incur a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence cost for their control efforts and an additional cost for the joint state. The proposed scheme consists of a greedy policy improvement step followed by an m-step temporal difference (TD) policy evaluation step. We use the separable structure of the instantaneous cost to show that the policy improvement step follows a Boltzmann distribution that depends on the current value function estimate and the uncontrolled transition probabilities. This allows agents to compute the improved joint policy independently. We show that both the synchronous (entire state space evaluation) and asynchronous (a uniformly sampled set of substates) versions of the OPI scheme with finite policy evaluation rollout converge to the optimal value function and an optimal joint policy asymptotically. Simulation results on a multi-agent MDP with KL control cost variant of the Stag-Hare game validates our scheme's performance in terms of minimizing the cost return.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robot Navigation Policies with Task-Specific Uncertainty Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. Effectively managing this uncertainty is crucial, but the optimal approach varies depending on the specific details of the task: different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions of the environment. For instance, a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precise state estimates in open areas. This varying need for certainty in different parts of the environment, depending on the task, calls for policies that can adapt their uncertainty management strategies based on task-specific requirements. In this paper, we present a framework for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Map (TSUM), which represents acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions of the operating environment for a given task. Using TSUM, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into the robot's decision-making process. We find that conditioning policies on TSUMs provides an effective way to express task-specific uncertainty requirements and enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies without the need for explicit reward engineering to balance task completion and uncertainty management. We evaluate GUIDE on a variety of real-world navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates compared to baselines. Evaluation videos can be found at https://guided-agents.github.io.</description>

      <title>Relay Incentive Mechanisms Using Wireless Power Transfer in Non-Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of a multi-attribute auction in a communication system to bring about efficient relaying in a non-cooperative setting. We consider a system where a source seeks to offload data to an access point (AP) while balancing both the timeliness and energy-efficiency of the transmission. A deep fade in the communication channel (due to, e.g., a line-of-sight blockage) makes direct communication costly, and the source may alternatively rely on non-cooperative UEs to act as relays. We propose a multi-attribute auction to select a UE and to determine the duration and power of the transmission, with payments to the UE taking the form of energy sent via wireless power transfer (WPT). The quality of the channel from a UE to the AP constitutes private information, and bids consist of a transmission time and transmission power. We show that under a second-preferred-offer auction, truthful bidding by all candidate UEs forms a Nash Equilibrium. However, this auction is not incentive compatible, and we present a modified auction in which truthful bidding is in fact a dominant strategy. Extensive numerical experimentation illustrates the efficacy of our approach, which we compare to a cooperative baseline. We demonstrate that with as few as two candidates, our improved mechanism leads to as much as a 76% reduction in energy consumption, and that with as few as three candidates, the transmission time decreases by as much as 55%. Further, we see that as the number of candidates increases, the performance of our mechanism approaches that of the cooperative baseline. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of multi-attribute auctions to enhance the efficiency of data transfer in non-cooperative settings.</description>

      <title>IntersectionZoo: Eco-driving for Benchmarking Multi-Agent Contextual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated and two-player applications, its success in messy real-world applications has been limited. A key challenge lies in its generalizability across problem variations, a common necessity for many real-world problems. Contextual reinforcement learning (CRL) formalizes learning policies that generalize across problem variations. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for multi-agent CRL has hindered progress in the field. Such benchmarks are desired to be based on real-world applications to naturally capture the many open challenges of real-world problems that affect generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose IntersectionZoo, a comprehensive benchmark suite for multi-agent CRL through the real-world application of cooperative eco-driving in urban road networks. The task of cooperative eco-driving is to control a fleet of vehicles to reduce fleet-level vehicular emissions. By grounding IntersectionZoo in a real-world application, we naturally capture real-world problem characteristics, such as partial observability and multiple competing objectives. IntersectionZoo is built on data-informed simulations of 16,334 signalized intersections derived from 10 major US cities, modeled in an open-source industry-grade microscopic traffic simulator. By modeling factors affecting vehicular exhaust emissions (e.g., temperature, road conditions, travel demand), IntersectionZoo provides one million data-driven traffic scenarios. Using these traffic scenarios, we benchmark popular multi-agent RL and human-like driving algorithms and demonstrate that the popular multi-agent RL algorithms struggle to generalize in CRL settings.</description>

      <title>TRIZ Method for Urban Building Energy Optimization: GWO-SARIMA-LSTM Forecasting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of global climate change and sustainable development goals, urban building energy consumption optimization and carbon emission reduction have become the focus of research. Traditional energy consumption prediction methods often lack accuracy and adaptability due to their inability to fully consider complex energy consumption patterns, especially in dealing with seasonal fluctuations and dynamic changes. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model that combines TRIZ innovation theory with GWO, SARIMA and LSTM to improve the accuracy of building energy consumption prediction. TRIZ plays a key role in model design, providing innovative solutions to achieve an effective balance between energy efficiency, cost and comfort by systematically analyzing the contradictions in energy consumption optimization. GWO is used to optimize the parameters of the model to ensure that the model maintains high accuracy under different conditions. The SARIMA model focuses on capturing seasonal trends in the data, while the LSTM model handles short-term and long-term dependencies in the data, further improving the accuracy of the prediction. The main contribution of this research is the development of a robust model that leverages the strengths of TRIZ and advanced deep learning techniques, improving the accuracy of energy consumption predictions. Our experiments demonstrate a significant 15% reduction in prediction error compared to existing models. This innovative approach not only enhances urban energy management but also provides a new framework for optimizing energy use and reducing carbon emissions, contributing to sustainable development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive design process for the integration of a robotic arm into a quadcopter, emphasizing the physical modeling, system integration, and controller development. Utilizing SolidWorks for mechanical design and MATLAB Simscape for simulation and control, this study addresses the challenges encountered in integrating the robotic arm with the drone, encompassing both mechanical and control aspects. Two types of controllers are developed and analyzed: a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and a Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC). The design and tuning of these controllers are key components of this research, with the focus on their application in package delivery tasks. Extensive simulations demonstrate the performance of each controller, with PID controllers exhibiting superior trajectory tracking and lower Root Mean Square (RMS) errors under various payload conditions. The results underscore the efficacy of PID control for stable flight and precise maneuvering, while highlighting adaptability of MRAC to changing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distributed Thompson sampling under constrained communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes a Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate a theoretical bound on Bayesian Simple Regret, where the bound depends on the size of the largest complete subgraph of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as there is a fully connected subgraph of at least two agents. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, illustrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Metamaterial Absorber for Solar Energy Harvesting in the THz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and comprehensive characterization of a novel three-layer metamaterial absorber, engineered to exploit the unique optical properties of gold, vanadium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. At the core of this design, silicon dioxide serves as a robust substrate that supports an intricately structured layer of gold and a top layer of vanadium dioxide. This configuration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities effectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber demonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning frequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the device maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This efficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz and 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure to interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the proposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization insensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical simulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the metamaterial's geometry and material composition. This process illuminated the critical role of the dielectric properties of silicon dioxide and the plasmonic effects induced by gold and vanadium dioxide layers, which collectively contribute to the high-performance metrics observed.</description>

      <title>Design of a Flexible Robot Arm for Safe Aerial Physical Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel compliant mechanism combining lightweight and energy dissipation for aerial physical interaction. Weighting 400~g at take-off, the mechanism is actuated in the forward body direction, enabling precise position control for force interaction and various other aerial manipulation tasks. The robotic arm, structured as a closed-loop kinematic chain, employs two deported servomotors. Each joint is actuated with a single tendon for active motion control in compression of the arm at the end-effector. Its elasto-mechanical design reduces weight and provides flexibility, allowing passive-compliant interactions without impacting the motors' integrity. Notably, the arm's damping can be adjusted based on the proposed inner frictional bulges. Experimental applications showcase the aerial system performance in both free-flight and physical interaction. The presented work may open safer applications for \ac{MAV} in real environments subject to perturbations during interaction.</description>

      <title>Assisted Physical Interaction: Autonomous Aerial Robots with Neural Network Detection, Navigation, and Safety Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework for safe and autonomous aerial physical interaction in industrial settings. It comprises two main components: a neural network-based target detection system enhanced with edge computing for reduced onboard computational load, and a control barrier function (CBF)-based controller for safe and precise maneuvering. The target detection system is trained on a dataset under challenging visual conditions and evaluated for accuracy across various unseen data with changing lighting conditions. Depth features are utilized for target pose estimation, with the entire detection framework offloaded into low-latency edge computing. The CBF-based controller enables the UAV to converge safely to the target for precise contact. Simulated evaluations of both the controller and target detection are presented, alongside an analysis of real-world detection performance.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible gate-first integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Loop Closure by Textual Cues in Challenging Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop closure is an important task in robot navigation. However, existing methods mostly rely on some implicit or heuristic features of the environment, which can still fail to work in common environments such as corridors, tunnels, and warehouses. Indeed, navigating in such featureless, degenerative, and repetitive (FDR) environments would also pose a significant challenge even for humans, but explicit text cues in the surroundings often provide the best assistance. This inspires us to propose a multi-modal loop closure method based on explicit human-readable textual cues in FDR environments. Specifically, our approach first extracts scene text entities based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), then creates a local map of text cues based on accurate LiDAR odometry and finally identifies loop closure events by a graph-theoretic scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that this approach has superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on visual and LiDAR sensors. To benefit the community, we release the source code and datasets at \url{https://github.com/TongxingJin/TXTLCD}.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Control and Readout Integrated Circuits for Solid-State Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of quantum computing, solid-state quantum systems, particularly superconducting ones, have made remarkable advancements over the past two decades. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing for next-generation applications necessitates the integration of several million qubits, which presents significant challenges in terms of interconnection complexity and latency that are currently unsolvable with state-of-the-art room-temperature control and readout electronics. Recently, cryogenic integrated circuits (ICs), including CMOS radio-frequency ICs and rapid-single-flux-quantum-logic ICs, have emerged as potential alternatives to room-temperature electronics. Unlike their room-temperature counterparts, these ICs are deployed within cryostats to enhance scalability by reducing the number and length of transmission lines. Additionally, operating at cryogenic temperatures can suppress electronic noise and improve qubit control fidelity. However, for CMOS ICs specifically, circuit design uncertainties arise due to a lack of reliable models for cryogenic field effect transistors as well as issues related to severe fickle noises and power dissipation at cryogenic temperatures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on both types of cryogenic control and readout ICs but primarily focuses on the more mature CMOS technology. The discussion encompasses principles underlying control and readout techniques employed in cryogenic CMOS ICs along with their architectural designs; characterization and modeling approaches for field effect transistors under cryogenic conditions; as well as fundamental concepts pertaining to rapid single flux quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Fully distributed and resilient source seeking for robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-contained, resilient and fully distributed solution for locating the maximum of an unknown 3D scalar field using a swarm of robots that travel at constant speeds. Unlike conventional reactive methods relying on gradient information, our methodology enables the swarm to determine an ascending direction so that it approaches the source with arbitrary precision. Our source-seeking solution consists of three algorithms. The first two algorithms run sequentially and distributively at a high frequency providing barycentric coordinates and the ascending direction respectively to the individual robots. The third algorithm is the individual control law for a robot to track the estimated ascending direction. We show that the two algorithms with higher frequency have an exponential convergence to their eventual values since they are based on the standard consensus protocol for first-order dynamical systems; their high frequency depends on how fast the robots travel through the scalar field. The robots are not constrained to any particular geometric formation, and we study both discrete and continuous distributions of robots within swarm shapes. The shape analysis reveals the resiliency of our approach as expected in robot swarms, i.e., by amassing robots we ensure the source-seeking functionality in the event of missing or misplaced individuals or even if the robot network splits into two or more disconnected subnetworks. In addition, we also enhance the robustness of the algorithm by presenting conditions for \emph{optimal} swarm shapes, in the sense that the ascending directions can be closely parallel to the field's gradient. We exploit such an analysis so that the swarm can adapt to unknown environments by morphing its shape and maneuvering while still following an ascending direction.</description>

      <title>Neural Predictor for Flight Control with Payload</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial robotics for transporting suspended payloads as the form of freely-floating manipulator are growing great interest in recent years. However, the prior information of the payload, such as the mass, is always hard to obtain accurately in practice. The force/torque caused by payload and residual dynamics will introduce unmodeled perturbations to the system, which negatively affects the closed-loop performance. Different from estimation-like methods, this paper proposes Neural Predictor, a learning-based approach to model force/torque caused by payload and residual dynamics as a dynamical system. It results a hybrid model including both the first-principles dynamics and the learned dynamics. This hybrid model is then integrated into a MPC framework to improve closed-loop performance. Effectiveness of proposed framework is verified extensively in both numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments. The results indicate that our approach can capture force/torque caused by payload and residual dynamics accurately, respond quickly to the changes of them and improve the closed-loop performance significantly. In particular, Neural Predictor outperforms a state-of-the-art learning-based estimator and has reduced the force and torque estimation errors by up to 66.15% and 33.33% while using less samples.</description>

      <title>Continuum Robot Shape Estimation Using Magnetic Ball Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape sensing of medical continuum robots is important both for closed-loop control as well as for enabling the clinician to visualize the robot inside the body. There is a need for inexpensive, but accurate shape sensing technologies. This paper proposes the use of magnetic ball chains as a means of generating shape-specific magnetic fields that can be detected by an external array of Hall effect sensors. Such a ball chain, encased in a flexible polymer sleeve, could be inserted inside the lumen of any continuum robot to provide real-time shape feedback. The sleeve could be removed, as needed, during the procedure to enable use of the entire lumen. To investigate this approach, a shape-sensing model for a steerable catheter tip is derived and an observability and sensitivity analysis are presented. Experiments show maximum estimation errors of 7.1% and mean of 2.9% of the tip position with respect to total length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating the theory-experiment cycle requires effective distributed workflows that utilize a computing continuum spanning lab instruments, edge sensors, computing resources at multiple facilities, data sets distributed across multiple information sources, and potentially cloud. Unfortunately, the obvious methods for constructing continuum platforms, orchestrating workflow tasks, and curating datasets over time fail to achieve scientific requirements for performance, energy, security, and reliability. Furthermore, achieving the best use of continuum resources depends upon the efficient composition and execution of workflow tasks, i.e., combinations of numerical solvers, data analytics, and machine learning. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's LDRD "Cloud, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Edge for Science and Security" (CHESS) has developed a set of interrelated capabilities for enabling distributed scientific workflows and curating datasets. This report describes the results and successes of CHESS from the perspective of open science.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks as a Controller for Emergent Swarm Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drones which can swarm and loiter in a certain area cost hundreds of dollars, but mosquitos can do the same and are essentially worthless. To control swarms of low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hours brainstorming robot configurations and policies to ``organically" create behaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing research explores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binary sensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure. Even agents in this highly limited sensing, actuation, and computational capability class can exhibit relatively complex global behaviors such as aggregation, milling, and dispersal, but finding the local interaction rules that enable more collective behaviors remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the feasibility of training spiking neural networks to find those local interaction rules that result in particular emergent behaviors. In this paper, we focus on simulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible using very simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionary algorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays) of a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, we also show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbent hand-picked binary controller structure. Our simulations show that spiking neural networks can be evolved in binary sensing agents to form a mill.</description>

Abstract: Prevailing wisdom asserts that one cannot rely on the cloud for critical real-time control systems like self-driving cars. We argue that we can, and must. Following the trends of increasing model sizes, improvements in hardware, and evolving mobile networks, we identify an opportunity to offload parts of time-sensitive and latency-critical compute to the cloud. Doing so requires carefully allocating bandwidth to meet strict latency SLOs, while maximizing benefit to the car.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.06725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timed discrete-event systems (TDES), which is a modelling formalism proposed by Brandin and Wonham, can be used for modelling scheduling and production planning problems. This paper aims to show that TDES are essentially synchronous product structures. The proof is constructive in the sense that a generalized synchronous product rule is provided to generate a TDES from the activity automaton and the timer automata (that is, the syntactic description of the TDES) after some model transformation. We then also explain how the generalized synchronous product operation can be reduced into the standard synchronous product operation and how to reduce the number of (refined) events introduced in the model transformation. Thus, any software that can compute synchronous products can be used to compute a TDES from its activity automaton and its timer automata, after the model transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study randomized experiments in a service system when stochastic congestion can arise from temporarily limited supply or excess demand. Such congestion gives rise to cross-unit interference between the waiting customers, and analytic strategies that do not account for this interference may be biased. In current practice, one of the most widely used ways to address stochastic congestion is to use switchback experiments that alternatively turn a target intervention on and off for the whole system. We find, however, that under a queueing model for stochastic congestion, the standard way of analyzing switchbacks is inefficient, and that estimators that leverage the queueing model can be materially more accurate. Additionally, we show how the queueing model enables estimation of total policy gradients from unit-level randomized experiments, thus giving practitioners an alternative experimental approach they can use without needing to pre-commit to a fixed switchback length before data collection.</description>

      <title>Distributed Error-Identification and Correction using Block-Sparse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional solutions for fault-detection, identification, and reconstruction (FDIR) require centralized decision-making mechanisms which are typically combinatorial in their nature, necessitating the design of an efficient distributed FDIR mechanism that is suitable for multi-agent applications. To this end, we develop a general framework for efficiently reconstructing a sparse vector being observed over a sensor network via nonlinear measurements. The proposed framework is used to design a distributed multi-agent FDIR algorithm based on a combination of the sequential convex programming (SCP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization approaches. The proposed distributed FDIR algorithm can process a variety of inter-agent measurements (including distances, bearings, relative velocities, and subtended angles between agents) to identify the faulty agents and recover their true states. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed multi-agent FDIR approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example in which the inter-agent distances are used to identify the faulty agents in a multi-agent configuration, as well as reconstruct their error vectors.</description>

      <title>Efficient MPC for Emergency Evasive Maneuvers, Part I: Hybridization of the Nonlinear Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the extensive application of nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) in automated driving, balancing its computational efficiency with respect to the control performance and constraint satisfaction remains a challenge in emergency scenarios: in such situations, sub-optimal but computationally fast responses are more valuable than optimal responses obtained after long computations. In this paper, we introduce a hybridization approach for efficient approximation of nonlinear vehicle dynamics and non-convex constraints using a hybrid systems modeling framework. Hybridization allows to reformulate the nonlinear MPC problem during emergency evasive maneuvers as a hybrid MPC problem. In this regard, Max-Min-Plus-Scaling (MMPS) hybrid modeling is used to approximate the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. Meanwhile, different formulations for constraint approximation are presented, and various grid-generation methods are compared to solve these approximation problems. Among these, two novel grid types are introduced to structurally include the influence of the system dynamics on the grid point distributions in the state domain. Overall, the work presents and compares three hybrid models and four hybrid constraints for efficient MPC synthesis and offers guidelines for implementation of the presented hybridization framework in other applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient MPC for Emergency Evasive Maneuvers, Part II: Comparative Assessment for Hybrid Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization-based approaches such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are promising approaches in proactive control for safety-critical applications with changing environments such as automated driving systems. However, the computational complexity of the MPC optimization problem coupled with the need for real-time control in hazardous scenarios is the main bottleneck in realization of automation levels four and five for driving systems. In this paper, we construct hybrid formulations of the nonlinear MPC problem for tracking control during emergency evasive maneuvers and assess their computational efficiency in terms of accuracy and solution time. To hybridize the MPC problem, we combine three hybrid approximations of the prediction model and four approximations of the nonlinear stability and tire saturation constraints and simulate the closed-loop behavior of the resulting controllers during five emergency maneuvers for different prediction horizons. Further, we compare the robustness of the controllers in the presence of friction uncertainty as well to assess the accuracy-time trade-off in cases where the friction of the road is either unknown or has an offset error with respect to the prediction model. This robustness is studied for different levels of friction uncertainty, as well as investigated with respect to the proximity to the vehicle handling limits. We show that the hybridization of the MPC problem is an efficient approach for real-time implementation of MPC during emergency evasive maneuvers, paving the way for implementation of high levels of automation.</description>

      <title>A Control-Recoverable Added-Noise-based Privacy Scheme for LQ Control in Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As networked control systems continue to evolve, ensuring the privacy of sensitive data becomes an increasingly pressing concern, especially in situations where the controller is physically separated from the plant. In this paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.</description>

      <title>Gain-Only Neural Operators for PDE Backstepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we advance the recently-introduced deep learning-powered approach to PDE backstepping control by proposing a method that approximates only the control gain function -- a function of one variable -- instead of the entire kernel function of the backstepping transformation, which depends on two variables. This idea is introduced using several benchmark unstable PDEs, including hyperbolic and parabolic types, and extended to 2X2 hyperbolic systems. By employing a backstepping transformation that utilizes the exact kernel (suitable for gain scheduling) rather than an approximated one (suitable for adaptive control), we alter the quantification of the approximation error. This leads to a significant simplification in the target system, shifting the perturbation due to approximation from the domain to the boundary condition. Despite the notable differences in the Lyapunov analysis, we are able to retain stability guarantees with this simplified approximation approach. Approximating only the control gain function simplifies the operator being approximated and the training of its neural approximation, potentially reducing the neural network size. The trade-off for these simplifications is a more intricate Lyapunov analysis, involving higher Sobolev spaces for some PDEs, and certain restrictions on initial conditions arising from these spaces. It is crucial to carefully consider the specific requirements and constraints of each problem to determine the most suitable approach; indeed, recent works have demonstrated successful applications of both full-kernel and gain-only approaches in adaptive control and gain scheduling contexts.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Formation Control of Non-Holonomic Multi-Robot Systems in Communication-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel estimator-based safety-critical controller for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots in communication-limited environments. The proposed decentralized framework integrates a robust state estimator with a formation tracking control law, addressing the challenges of inter-agent collision avoidance and disturbance attenuation in leader-follower formations using control barrier functions. The estimator's design accounts for both constant and time-varying velocity profiles, enhancing the system's adaptability to dynamic scenarios. A closed-form solution for the tracking controller facilitates efficient implementation while maintaining formation integrity. The incorporation of string stability metrics further reinforces the framework's resilience against propagating disturbances from predecessors. Rigorous stability analysis using Lyapunov functions ensures the stability of estimation errors and the convergence of the formation to desired configurations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are validated through numerical simulations of various maneuvers and realistic Gazebo experiments involving formations in a warehouse environment. The results demonstrate the controller's ability to maintain safety, achieve precise formation control, and mitigate disturbances in scenarios without inter-robot communication.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology has given rise to a new area called mobile edge generation and computing (MEGC), which offers mobile users heterogeneous services such as task computing and content generation. In this letter, we investigate the joint communication, computation, and the AIGC resource allocation problem in an MEGC system. A latency minimization problem is first formulated to enhance the quality of service for mobile users. Due to the strong coupling of the optimization variables, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower latency than two baseline algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This research explores the enhancement of lunar landing precision through an advanced structured light system, integrating machine learning, Iterative Learning Control (ILC) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) techniques. By employing Moire fringe patterns for high-precision scanning maneuvers, the study addresses the limitations of conventional structured light systems. A nonlinear mathematical optimization model is developed to refine the world model, optimizing oscillation frequency and amplitude to improve resolution.

      <title>How many autonomous vehicles are required to stabilize traffic flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective behavior of human-driven vehicles (HVs) produces the well-known stop-and-go waves potentially leading to higher fuel consumption and emissions. This paper investigates the stabilization of traffic flow via a minimum number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to constraints on the control parameters aiming to reduce the number of vehicles on the road while achieving lower fuel consumption and emissions. The unconstrained scenario has been well-studied in recent studies. The main motivation to investigate the constrained scenario is that, in realistic engineering applications, lower and upper bounds exist on the control parameters. For the constrained scenario, we optimally find the minimum number of required AVs (via computing the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate) to stabilize traffic flow for a given number of HVs. As an immediate consequence, we conclude that for a given number of AVs, the number of HVs in the stabilized traffic flow may not be arbitrarily large in the constrained scenario unlike the unconstrained scenario studied in the literature. We systematically propose a procedure to compute the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate using nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, we validate the theoretical results via numerical simulations. Numerical simulations suggest that enlarging the constraint intervals makes a smaller optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate attainable. However, it leads to a slower transient response due to a dominant pole closer to the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Koopman Control Family (KCF), a mathematical framework for modeling general (not necessarily control-affine) discrete-time nonlinear control systems with the aim of providing a solid theoretical foundation for the use of Koopman-based methods in systems with inputs. We demonstrate that the concept of KCF captures the behavior of nonlinear control systems on a (potentially infinite-dimensional) function space. By employing a generalized notion of subspace invariance under the KCF, we establish a universal form for finite-dimensional models, which encompasses the commonly used linear, bilinear, and linear switched models as specific instances. In cases where the subspace is not invariant under the KCF, we propose a method for approximating models in general form and characterize the model's accuracy using the concept of invariance proximity. We end by discussing how the proposed framework naturally lends itself to data-driven modeling of control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Miniature robotic blimps, as one type of lighter-than-air aerial vehicles, have attracted increasing attention in the science and engineering community for their enhanced safety, extended endurance, and quieter operation compared to quadrotors. Accurately modeling the dynamics of these robotic blimps poses a significant challenge due to the complex aerodynamics stemming from their large lifting bodies. Traditional first-principle models have difficulty obtaining accurate aerodynamic parameters and often overlook high-order nonlinearities, thus coming to its limit in modeling the motion dynamics of miniature robotic blimps. To tackle this challenge, this letter proposes the Auto-tuning Blimp-oriented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation method (ABNODE), a data-driven approach that integrates first-principle and neural network modeling. Spiraling motion experiments of robotic blimps are conducted, comparing the ABNODE with first-principle and other data-driven benchmark models, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Integrating solid direct air capture systems with green hydrogen production: Economic synergy of sector coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stands as a pivotal challenge. With escalating atmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems becomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal medium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated with these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to significant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when deployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system efficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage devices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the economic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus alkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings indicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant economic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers and a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers.

      <title>TieBot: Learning to Knot a Tie from Visual Demonstration through a Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tie-knotting task is highly challenging due to the tie's high deformation and long-horizon manipulation actions. This work presents TieBot, a Real-to-Sim-to-Real learning from visual demonstration system for the robots to learn to knot a tie. We introduce the Hierarchical Feature Matching approach to estimate a sequence of tie's meshes from the demonstration video. With these estimated meshes used as subgoals, we first learn a teacher policy using privileged information. Then, we learn a student policy with point cloud observation by imitating teacher policy. Lastly, our pipeline applies learned policy to real-world execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TieBot in simulation and the real world. In the real-world experiment, a dual-arm robot successfully knots a tie, achieving 50% success rate among 10 trials. Videos can be found https://tiebots.github.io/.</description>

      <title>SustainDC: Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Sparse Mamba: Reinforcing Controllability In Structural State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of controllability and observability to the Mamba SSM's architecture in our Sparse-Mamba (S-Mamba) for natural language processing (NLP) applications. The structured state space model (SSM) development in recent studies, such as Mamba and Mamba2, outperformed and solved the computational inefficiency of transformers and large language models at small to medium scale. The Mamba SSMs architecture drops the need for attention layers or multilayer perception blocks in transformers. However, current Mamba models lack reinforcement of controllability in state-space equations for computing the $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ matrices at each time step, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. In this paper, we demonstrate a reduction of parameters in comparison to the first published Mamba and Mamba2. We showcase an improvement in perplexity by 5\% and a decrease in training time by 3\% after reinforcing controllability and observability on the original Mamba architecture in our proposed S-Mamba. The controllable $n \times n$ state matrix $A$ is sparse and it has only $n$ free parameters. Our novel approach will ensure a controllable system which will be the gate key for Mamba3.</description>

      <title>Developing Path Planning with Behavioral Cloning and Proximal Policy Optimization for Path-Tracking and Static Obstacle Nudging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end methods utilizing Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are becoming more and more common. However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow and planning with horizons, resulting in strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce a path planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference waypoints and performs modified path for different controllers. Experimental results show that the algorithm can do path following that mimics the expert performance of path-tracking controllers, and avoid collision to fixed obstacles. The method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in path planning problems of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown deriving the pseudometrics from unitary transformations is necessary to recover a value of zero if two systems are topologically conjugate. Therefore the pseudometrics for quantifying deviation from conjugacy are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Finally, geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugac Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible solutions given just two Pareto points based. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problems and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified `man-made' or bio-inspired approaches. The benefits of considering operator based and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism were demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimal control for delay differential equations: A simultaneous approach based on linearization of the delayed state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry, and they must be accounted for when designing control strategies. However, numerical optimal control (NOC) of delay differential equations (DDEs) is challenging because it requires specialized discretization methods and the time delays may depend on the manipulated inputs or state variables. Therefore, in this work, we propose to linearize the delayed states around the current time. This results in a set of implicit differential equations, and we compare the steady states and the corresponding stability criteria of the DDEs and the approximate system. Furthermore, we propose a simultaneous approach for NOC of DDEs based on the linearization, and we discretize the approximate system using Euler's implicit method. Finally, we present a numerical example involving a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-Based Switching Scheme for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Fixed Attitude-Error Quaternion During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a switching scheme, which uses both the attitude-error quaternion (AEQ) and the angular-velocity error, for controlling the rotational degrees of freedom of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight. In this approach, the proposed controller continually selects the stable closed-loop (CL) equilibrium AEQ corresponding to the smallest cost between those computed with two energy-based Lyapunov functions. To analyze and enforce the stability of the CL switching dynamics, we use basic nonlinear theory. This research problem is relevant because the selection of the stable CL equilibrium AEQ directly determines the power and energy requirements of the controlled UAV during flight. To test and demonstrate the implementation, suitability, functionality, and performance of the proposed approach, we present experimental results obtained using a 31-gram quadrotor, which was controlled to execute high-speed yaw maneuvers in flight. These flight tests show that the proposed switching controller can respectively reduce the control effort and rotational power by as much as 49.75 % and 28.14 %, on average, compared to those corresponding to an often-used benchmark controller.</description>

      <title>Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.</description>
