      <title>The Fractional Korn Inequality on Uniform Domains and New Korn Inequalities for Truncated Seminorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the so-called second case of the fractional Korn inequality for uniform domains. We obtain this result as an application of a novel fractional Korn-type inequality formulated in terms of truncated seminorms, which turns out to be valid for the broader class of John domains. We also obtain weighted estimates in which the weights are certain powers of the distance to the boundary that depend on the fractional exponent and the Assouad codimension of the boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of bounded entropy solutions to the one-dimensional system of isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws, allowing for the presence of vacuum states. We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a \textbf{weighted pressure perturbation} designed to enforce acoustic degeneracy at a cut-off density $\rho=\delta$. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the \textbf{strict preservation of the mass conservation law}, in contrast to previous regularization methods that require modifying the continuity equation. We prove that the perturbed pressure $\tilde{P}$ exactly inherits the convexity structure of the original equation of state (satisfying $2\tilde{P}'+\rho\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+\rho P''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical entropy without auxiliary transformations. This structural preservation allows for the direct application of the Chueh-Conley-Smoller theory to establish uniform $L^\infty$ bounds via invariant regions. The convergence to a global weak solution in the vanishing regularization limit is finally proved using the method of compensated compactness and a singular analysis of the entropy equation near the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Scattering by a Cluster of Hybrid Dielectric-Plasmonic Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by a cluster of hybrid dielectric-plasmonic dimers in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes.
  Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.
  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions. In particular, it suggests parameter regimes where clusters of hybrid dimers can generate (double) negative effective permittivity and permeability and bi-anisotropic constitutive laws and eventually hyperbolic media.</description>

      <title>Global compressible Euler-Poisson limit of the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for all cutoff potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system is a fundamental model in dilute collisional plasmas. In this work, we study the compressible ionic Euler-Poisson limit of the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for the full range of cutoff potentials $-3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$. By employing a truncated Hilbert expansion together with a novel weighted $H^1_{x,v}$-$W^{1,\infty}_{x,v}$ framework, we prove that the solution of the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann converges globally in time to the smooth global solution of the compressible ionic Euler-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Regularity theory for sub-critical $p$-parabolic systems with measurable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative regularity theory is developed for weak solutions to the parabolic system $$ \partial_t u-\mathrm{div}\,{\boldsymbol{\mathsf A}}(x,t,Du)=0 \quad\text{in }E_T\subset \mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}, $$ which features the $p$-Laplacian with measurable coefficients. We focus on the sub-critical range $1&lt;p\le \tfrac{2N}{N+2}$ and obtain two main results. \emph{Local boundedness:} starting from an $L^{\boldsymbol{\mathsf r}}$-control of $u$ with ${\boldsymbol{\mathsf r}}&gt;\frac{N(2-p)}{p}$, we derive sharp, scale-invariant $L^\infty$-estimates. \emph{Higher integrability of the gradient:} $|Du|$ self-improves from $L^p_{\mathrm{loc}}$ to $L^{p(1+\varepsilon)}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$ depending only on the data. The same results still hold given proper source terms.</description>

      <title>Non-local singular perturbations of non-convex functionals -- recent results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular perturbations have been used to select solutions of (non-convex) variational problems with a multiplicity of minimizers. The prototype of such an approach is the gradient theory of phase transitions by L. Modica, who specialized some earlier Gamma-convergence results by himself and S. Mortola contained in a seminal paper, validating the so-called minimal-interface criterion. I will give an overview of some recent results on perturbations with fractional and higher-order seminorms both in the framework of phase transitions and of free-discontinuity problems, relating these results with the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu and Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova limit analysis for fractional Sobolev seminorms, and with the theory of Gamma-expansions.</description>

      <title>Energy-variational solutions for geodynamical two-phase flows -- From logarithmic to double-obstacle potentials by variational convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Cheng, Lasarzik, Thomas 2025 ARXIV-Preprint 2509.25508], we studied a Cahn--Hilliard two-phase model describing the flow of two viscoelastoplastic fluids in the framework of dissipative solutions using a logarithmic potential for the phase-field variable. This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases. This study underlines that, thanks to its structure, the energy-variational solution is better suited for variational convergence methods than the dissipative solution.</description>

      <title>A selection principle for 2D steady Euler flows via the vanishing viscosity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2D Euler system, governing inviscid incompressible flow, admits infinitely many steady solutions. To identify which are physically realizable, we investigate the vanishing viscosity limit of the steady Navier-Stokes system. Here, a steady Euler flow with a slip boundary condition is called a vanishing viscosity limit if it is the $L^\infty_{\textup{loc}}\cap H^1_{\textup{loc}}$ limit of steady Navier-Stokes solutions (it is known that strong boundary layers can persist). We then completely classify the vanishing viscosity limit in specific planar domains.
  In a bounded connected domain, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limit is the constant-vorticity flow. This result does not require the approximating Navier-Stokes solutions to have nested closed streamlines, an essential assumption in the century-old Prandtl-Batchelor theorem. In a strip where the Navier-Stokes velocity (but not the pressure) is periodic in the strip direction, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limits are constant flow, Couette flow, and Poiseuille flow. The proof of the latter result relies on the former and on a powerful rigidity theorem, which asserts that any non-shear steady Euler flow in a periodic strip must have contractible closed streamlines.</description>

      <title>Non-local planelike minimizers and $\Gamma$-convergence of periodic energies to a local anisotropic perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem related to a non-local interface energy with a periodic forcing term. We show the existence of planelike minimizers for such energy. Moreover, we prove that, under suitable assumptions on the non-local kernel and the external field, the sequence of rescaled energies $\Gamma$-converges to a suitable local anisotropic perimeter, where the anisotropy is defined as the limit of the normalized energy of a planelike minimizer in larger and larger cubes (i.e., what is called in jargon "stable norm"). To obtain this, we also establish several auxiliary results, including: the minimality of the level sets of the minimizers, explicit bounds on the oscillations of the minimizers, density estimates for almost minimizers, and non-local perimeter estimates in the large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence result for a free boundary problem inspired by the modelization of accretive growth. The growth process is formulated through a level-set approach, leading to a boundary-value problem for a Hamilton-Jacobi equation within a prescribed constraining set. Existence, variational representability, and regularity of solutions to the growth subproblem are investigated. The full system arises from coupling the growth dynamics with an elliptic equation for the activation field. Existence of solutions to the fully coupled free boundary problems is obtained via an iterative procedure.</description>

      <title>Failure of uniqueness for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first negative results for scalar conservation laws. We begin with explicit examples where bounded initial data leads to $L^{\infty}$ blow-up despite flux regularity. More strikingly, we demonstrate that Kru\v{z}kov's entropy equalities alone fail to ensure uniqueness in this regime by constructing infinitely many entropy solutions to a single Cauchy problem with bounded initial datum, each continuous in time with respect to the $L^{1}$ norm. Thus, we demonstrate that the $L^{\infty}$ assumption is essential for the doubling of variables argument, and hence for the uniqueness of entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws. On the positive side, we develop a novel theory for scalar conservation laws with spatial heterogeneity by adapting the front tracking method. We recover uniqueness by imposing a Lax-type condition in addition to the entropy inequality, motivated by the properties of our front tracking approximations. Unbounded Kru\v{z}kov solutions do not necessarily satisfy the weak formulation; we show that global weak solutions may not even exist in a natural class for some Cauchy problems of this form, even when Kru\v{z}kov entropy solutions exist. Finally, we construct an explicit example of global ill-posedness with bounded initial datum.</description>

      <title>Three Bernstein type theorems for hypersurfaces with zero Gaussian curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Bernstein type theorems for entire convex graphical hypersurfaces with zero Gaussian curvature in both Euclidean and Minkowski context. A supplementary example illustrates that zero Gaussian convex spacelike hypersurfaces are not necessary hyperplanes without additional conditions. We show that a zero Gaussian curvature convex hypersurface must be a hyperplane if the mean curvature goes to zero at infinity. In the Minkowski context, we prove similar results for hypersurface without timelike points.</description>

      <title>On octonionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation and pluripotential theory associated to octonionic plurisubharmonic functions of two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several aspects of pluripotential theory are generalized to octonionic plurisubharmonic (OPSH) functions of two variables. We prove the comparison principle for continuous OPSH functions and the quasicontinuity of locally bounded ones. An important tool is a formula of integration by parts for mixed octonionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. Various useful properties of octonionic relative extremal functions and octonionic capacity are established. The main difficulty is the non-associativity of octonions. However, some weak form of associativity can be used to covercome this difficulty. Another important ingredient in pluripotential theory is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous octonionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on the unit ball, for which we show the $C_{loc}^{1,1}$-regularity by applying Bedford-Taylor's method. The obstacle to do so is that an OPSH function is usually not OPSH under automorphisms of the unit ball. This issue can be solved by finding a weighted transformation formula of OPSH functions.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws and exact solutions of a nonlinear acoustics equation by classical symmetry reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and conservation laws are studied for a generalized Westervelt equation which is a nonlinear partial differential equation modelling the propagation of sound waves in a compressible medium. This nonlinear wave equation is widely used in nonlinear acoustics and it is especially important in biomedical applications such as ultra-sound imaging in human tissue. Modern methods are applied to uncover point symmetries and conservation laws that can lead to useful developments concerning solutions and their properties. A complete classification of point symmetries is shown for the arbitrary function. Local low-order conservation laws related to net mass of sound waves are obtained by the multiplier method. Two potential systems are derived yielding potential symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws. For the physical case interesting for this equation, travelling wave solutions are studied leading to shock waves.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dirac controls for time-periodic bistable ODEs, application to population replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses an optimal control problem on a dynamics governed by a nonlinear differential equation with a bistable time-periodic nonlinearity. This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue.</description>

      <title>Half-space theorems for translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish nonexistence results for complete translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow under suitable growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature and on the norm of the second fundamental form. We first show that such solitons cannot be entirely contained in the complement of a right rotational cone whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the translation direction. We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical model of stochastic search tracks a randomly diffusing "searcher" until it finds a "target." Owing to its many applications across science and engineering, this perennially popular problem has been thoroughly investigated in a variety of models. However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or "heterogeneous" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the It\^{o}-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We show almost sure wellposedness of mild solution to the cubic nonlinear wave equation in a weighted Besov space over $\mathbb R^2$. To achieve this, we show that any weak limit of $\phi^4$ measures on increasing tori is invariant under the equation. We review and slightly simplify the periodic theory and the construction of the weak limit measure, and then use finite speed of propagation to reduce the infinite-volume case to the previous setup. Our argument also gives a weaker invariance result on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the same setting.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the monotonicity of the minimal period of periodic solutions of quasilinear differential equations involving the $p$-Laplace operator. First, the monotonicity of the period is obtained as a function of a Hamiltonian energy in two cases. We extend to $p\ge2$ classical results due to Chow-Wang and Chicone for $p=2$. Then we consider a differential equation associated with a fundamental interpolation inequality in Sobolev spaces. In that case, we generalize monotonicity results by Miyamoto-Yagasaki and Benguria-Depassier-Loss to $p\ge2$.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of Moffatt's magnetic relaxation equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for a family of equations introduced by Moffatt to model magnetic relaxation. These equations are topology-preserving and admit all stationary solutions to the classical incompressible Euler equations as steady states. In the work of Beekie, Friedlander and Vicol, global regularity results have been established for initial magnetic field B0 $\in$ Hs(Td)(s &gt; d/2+1) when the regularization parameter $\gamma$ in the equations satisfies $\gamma$ &gt; $\gamma$c := d/2+1. Global regularity for $\gamma$ $\in$ [0, $\gamma$c] is left as an open problem, as well as the existence of weak solutions with rough initial data for any $\gamma$ $\ge$ 0. In this paper, we show that for any solenoidal magnetic field B0 $\in$ L2(Td) there exists a unique global weak solution when $\gamma$ &gt; $\gamma$c. Moreover, the solution can propagate higher-order Sobolev regularity. These results hold true for the borderline case $\gamma$ = $\gamma$c only if B0 $\in$ L2+(Td).</description>

      <title>$L^2$-based stability of blowup with log correction for semilinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative proof of the classical result of Type-I blowup with log correction for the semilinear heat equation. Compared with previous proofs, we use a novel idea of enforcing stable normalizations for perturbations around the approximate profile and we establish a weighted $H^k$ stability, thereby avoiding the use of a topological argument and the analysis of a linearized spectrum. Consequently, this approach can be adopted even if we only have a numerical profile and do not have explicit information on the spectrum of its linearized operator. This result generalizes the $L^2$-based stability framework beyond exactly self-similar blowup and can be adapted to higher dimensions. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of our normalization, even in the large perturbation regime beyond our theoretical setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a singular inhomogeneous term. For this aim, we establish decay estimates of the fractional heat semigroup in several uniformly local Zygumnd spaces. Furthermore, we apply the real interpolation method in uniformly local Zygmund spaces to obtain sharp integral estimates on the inhomogeneous term and the nonlinear term. This enables us to find sharp sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a singular inhomogeneous term.</description>

We also establish similar identity for systems of equations. As applications of this identity, we deduce a unique continuation property of eigenfunctions and also the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions in star-shaped domains under suitable condition on $f$.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability.The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains.
  In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins-Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fails. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our approach separates the domain's geometric properties from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.
  Beyond the stationary theory, the same ODE-generated barrier also yields natural sub- and supersolutions for the mean curvature flow of graphs, allowing one to initiate and control the short-time evolution from non-mean convex boundaries. As a consequence, our barrier construction extends a classical result of Ecker-Huisken on short-time existence of graphical mean curvature flow to domains with non-mean convex boundary; in the mean convex setting, their original result is recovered.</description>

The resulting problem is associated with an energy functional. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution, which is obtained via the direct minimization of the corresponding energy functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global controllability properties of the Cahn--Hilliard equation posed on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We first establish small-time global approximate controllability of the system by means of controls acting on finitely many Fourier modes, relying on techniques inspired by geometric control theory. We then prove null controllability of the linearized equation using a spatially localized control supported on an arbitrary measurable subset of positive Lebesgue measure, based on quantitative propagation of smallness estimates for the free dynamics. For dimensions $d \in \{1,2,3\}$, we further derive local null controllability for the full nonlinear system via a fixed-point argument. By combining these results, we establish global null controllability of the Cahn--Hilliard equation. This work provides the first result on global controllability for this equation, achieved through a two-stage strategy in which the control is first localized in Fourier space and subsequently restricted to a set of positive measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among Lie submodels of the (real symmetric potential) dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation, we single out a remarkable submodel as such that, despite being the only one, is associated with a family of in general inequivalent one-dimensional subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of this equation, which are parameterized by an arbitrary function of the time variable. The large family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an arbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the well-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with respect to a space-like submodel invariant variable. The singled out submodel possesses many other interesting properties. In particular, we show that it is Lie-remarkable, and its maximal Lie invariance algebra completely defines its point symmetry pseudogroup, which provides the second but simpler example of the latter phenomenon in literature. Moreover, only hidden Lie symmetries of the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation that are associated with this submodel are essential for finding its exact solutions. Using Lie reductions, we construct new families of exact solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation in closed or parametric form. We also exhaustively described generalized symmetries, cosymmetries and conservation laws of the submodel, which gives the corresponding nonlocal and hidden structures for the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces for $p&gt;q$ and $q\leq 1$, which aims to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $(p,q)$-th dual curvature measure in the Euclidean half-space. We reduce it to a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap, we prove that there exists a unique smooth solution that solves this problem provided $\theta\in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$.</description>

      <title>A note on the space-time variational formulation for the wave equation with source term in $L^2(Q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a variational formulation for the scalar wave equation in the second-order formulation on bounded Lipschitz domains and homogeneous initial conditions. We investigate a variational framework in a bounded space-time cylinder $Q$ with a new solution space and the test space $L^2(Q)$ for source terms in $L^2(Q)$. Using existence and uniqueness results in $H^1(Q)$, we prove that this variational setting fits the inf-sup theory, including an isomorphism as solution operator. Moreover, we show that the new solution space is not a subspace of $H^2(Q)$. This new uniqueness and solvability result is not only crucial for discretizations using space-time methods, including least-squares approaches, but also important for regularity results and the analysis of related space-time boundary integral equations, which form the basis for space-time boundary element methods.</description>
