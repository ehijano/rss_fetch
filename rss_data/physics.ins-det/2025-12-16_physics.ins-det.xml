      <title>Updated Simulation of GRETA Detector Response and Exploration of Temperature Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) is a next-generation gamma-ray spectrometer designed to push the frontiers of nuclear structure and astrophysics experiment. Its high sensitivity is enabled by high-precision localization of gamma-ray interactions within its active detector volume, and the subsequent tracking of gamma-ray scattering sequences. In order to perform gamma-ray tracking, we need to simulate signal generation in the detectors accurately. This requires both accurate calculations of charge movement in the semiconductor volume, as well as a faithful reproduction of real-world experimental effects such as the electronics response. This work addresses the fidelity of the calculated signals for GRETA in two ways. An updated approach has been applied to find an optimized parameterization of the electronics response, while the impact of the detector temperature was also explored to best reproduce experimental signals and improve the position localization performance for GRETA. The results suggest that the electronics response can be simplified without impacting performance, and that the response correction parameters can effectively compensate for the changes in signal which arise due to the crystal temperature, resulting in minimal sensitivity of the position resolution to the assumed temperature.</description>

      <title>A nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity for single-molecule trapping and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecules exhibit dynamic conformations critical to their functions, yet observing these processes at the single-molecule level under native conditions remains a formidable challenge. While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult. Here, we introduce a nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity that enables precise, non-perturbative trapping of individual biomolecules for extended observation times, eliminating the need for external forces. Using nucleosomes as model systems, we demonstrate single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor relative distances. Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules. We envision this nanocavity platform as a powerful tool for interrogating molecular dynamics in physiologically relevant environments, offering unperturbed access to weak and transient interactions that are central to biological regulation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Radiation and AC Coupling on Time Performance of Analog Pixels Test Structures in 65 nm CMOS technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) in advanced CMOS imaging technologies are key to next-generation tracking systems for high-energy physics, where radiation hardness and precise vertex reconstruction are essential. As part of the ALICE ITS3 R&amp;D program in synergy with the CERN R&amp;D, we evaluated the performance of the Analog Pixel Test Structures (APTS) fabricated in the TPSCo 65 nm CMOS imaging process. The prototypes employ 10 um pitch pixels with a fast operational amplifier-based buffering stage at the output, enabling direct characterization of intrinsic sensor response. Beam tests with minimum ionizing particles assessed the timing and charge collection of DC- and AC-coupled designs, including devices exposed to 10^14 NIEL and 10^15 NIEL non ioninsing energy loss. DC-coupled sensors demonstrated stable performance, maintaining time resolution lower than 70 ps and &gt;99% detection efficiency up to 10^15 NIEL.
  AC-coupled sensors demonstrated a wide operational margin, with efficiencies above 99% for clusterization thresholds below 150 electrons. Even though the AC coupling allows higher reverse bias than DC-coupled sensors, the reduced signal amplitude lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, increasing the jitter contribution. At high reverse bias, the AC-coupled sensors achieve time resolutions comparable to the DC-coupled version, demonstrating the viability of both approaches. These results also suggest that combining the low capacitance of DC-coupled designs with the high-bias capability of AC coupling could further enhance time resolution.
  These results confirm the suitability of 65 nm MAPS for future collider detectors requiring high radiation tolerance, efficiency, and timing precision.</description>

      <title>Large Errors in Kinetic Temperature Measurements Using Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on random errors in kinetic temperature measurements due to position uncertainty in particle tracking velocimetry. Using simulated data, we isolate the effects of spatial resolution and the frame rate on particle velocity calculations. A sample of particle velocities is generated from a Maxwellian distribution at a known temperature. Particle positions are assigned randomly and roughened to match a prescribed spatial resolution. Velocities are restored using the two-frame tracking method, and the kinetic temperature is calculated. By repeating this procedure, we obtain the discrepancy as a function of the spatial resolution and frame rate. Results show that, under typical experimental conditions, the restored kinetic temperature can deviate significantly from the true value, with spatial resolution playing a more dominant role than the frame rate.</description>

      <title>Rethinking massive multiplexing in whispering gallery mode biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, label-free quantification of multiple analytes in complex biological media remains a major challenge due to limited multiplexing, signal cross-correlations, and inconsistency across sensor samples and measurement runs. We introduce a multiplexed whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) biosensing framework that overcomes these barriers by jointly advancing photonic integration and data analytics. Our glass-chip platform enables massive, parallelized and flexible multiplexing of &gt;10000 microresonators organized into up to 100 sensing channels, with universal and modular chip design and detection hardware, while maintaining loaded Q-factors of 10^6. Our novel hybrid deep-learning framework BioCCF that integrates domain adaptation with cross-channel fusion enables harmonization of responses across sensing chips and extraction of nonlinear correlations in complex mixtures. Using a highly heterogeneous dataset comprising over 200 hours of sensing data acquired from nine chips with different channel configurations, biological replicates, and repeated regeneration cycles, we demonstrate recalibration-free identification of solution (99.3\% accuracy) and quantification of immunoglobulin G components with relative prediction error of 10^-4 under 5 min. The affordability and modularity of the platform enable distributed data acquisition and aggregation into shared repositories, providing a pathway toward continuously improving model generalization, cross-validation and a scalable, community-driven paradigm for biosensing.</description>

      <title>HEL1OS -- A Hard X-ray Spectrometer on Board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer) is one of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission designed to continuously monitor and measure the time-resolved spectra of solar flares between 8 keV and 150 keV. This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\circ$ $\times$ 6$^\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.</description>

      <title>Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution imaging for endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical endoscopy plays a crucial role in minimally invasive medical diagnostics and therapeutic procedures. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art endoscopic zoom objectives are bulky, requiring multi-element lens actuation, which can limit continued miniaturization. Point-scanning super-resolution approaches improve spatial resolution by illuminating the scene with a reduced-width focused spot, yet mechanical scanning requirements limit applicability in clinical settings. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution (Flaps) microscopy system, which exploits a multi-level phase-only diffractive optical element (DOE) to generate super-resolution spot(s) and uses a high-speed digital micromirror device (DMD) to deliver the illumination without mechanical scanning. Two imaging architectures are explored: a single super-resolution spot (0.47 Airy spot) or a 5 times 5 super-resolution spot array (0.52 Airy spot) in the far-field; the DMD scans the spot or spot array in the object plane at kHz rates. To demonstrate super-resolution imaging with high-speed acquisition using optical elements suitable for future deployment in endoscopy, we image a label-free resolution test target and fluorescently labelled cells.</description>

      <title>A pair polarimeter for multi-GeV $\gamma$-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessing the polarization of photon allows to understand the mechanisms behind its emission or scattering, revealing much about a peculiar environment or a probed object. For energy above $\sim$10~MeV, the pair production dominates the photon-matter interaction and the photon polarization is accessible via the azimuthal angle of the conversion. Unfortunately pair polarimeters have a low figure-of-merit for multi-GeV photons and are mostly used for beam characterization. In this paper, we report a new concept of a compact pair polarimeter associating monolithic active pixel sensors to low-density extended solid converters to reach simultaneously a high efficiency of $\sim$7\% and intrinsic analyzing power ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. This new concept will add a new obersvable to the multi-messenger physics, isolate the intrinsic strong force in nucleons and possibly reveal violations of Lorentz invariance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the performance of SiPM at cryogenic temperature for the sub-meV threshold detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel particle detector concept that exploits the breaking of superconducting Cooper pairs, offering a theoretical energy threshold at the sub-meV level. A major challenge for such detectors is the readout of quasiparticles at mK temperatures, where the Cooper pair binding energy is at the sub-meV level, making conventional electronic devices ineffective. Here we demonstrate that silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain full avalanche multiplication capability at environmental temperatures as low as 10 mK. Compared to room temperature operation, the dark count rate decreases by seven orders of magnitude while the gain is reduced by only a factor of 4.44. we present a characterization of several important performance parameters of the SiPM at 10~mK, including breakdown voltage, second divergence voltage, operating voltage range, output waveform characteristics, gain, single-photoelectron resolution, dark count rate, and the correlated noise probability. These results show that SiPMs operating at 10 mK provide sufficient gain and extremely low noise suitable for quasiparticle detection. Based on this finding, we propose a conceptual readout scheme for sub-meV threshold superconducting detectors using PN junction electron multiplication, which holds promise for advancing new searches for neutrino, dark matter, and other rare low-energy processes.</description>

Abstract: Garfield++ is extensively used within the gaseous detector community for comprehensive detector simulations, supporting the full experimental life cycle from design to operation and calibration. The emergence of micro-pattern gaseous detectors has necessitated computationally intensive microscopic avalanche simulations. The acceleration of one of Garfield++'s most demanding algorithms, AvalancheMicroscopic, by porting it to graphics processing units using NVIDIA's CUDA framework is described. The modifications are integrated into the Garfield++ codebase and are accessible to end users with only minor adjustments to their existing code. Benchmark results demonstrate substantial speed-up, especially for high-gain avalanches involving thousands of electrons, thereby enabling more efficient and detailed detector simulations.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of Super-Kamiokande with Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande [SK] was upgraded through the addition of gadolinium sulfate to its ultrapure water, initiating the SK-Gd program. This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Thermal Modeling of Microwave High Density Signaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit is approximately 140 qubits.</description>

      <title>Photon-starved imaging through turbulence at the diffraction limit</title>

Abstract: Ground-based imaging systems struggle to achieve diffraction-limited resolution when atmospheric turbulence and photon scarcity act simultaneously. In this regime, conventional adaptive optics, speckle imaging, and blind deconvolution lack sufficient information diversity to reliably estimate either the scene or the turbulence. We present Turbulence Aware Poisson Blind Deconvolution (TAP-BD), a framework designed for robust image recovery in these extreme conditions. TAP-BD extracts more information from coded-detection through phase diversity and decodes it with a physics-informed optimization that incorporates low photon Poisson statistics. Experiments show that TAP-BD provides reliable reconstructions of both scene and turbulence using only a few tens of measurements, even under strong aberrations and photon-starved conditions where existing methods fail. This capability enables photon-efficient, turbulence resilient imaging for applications such as space situational awareness and long-range remote sensing.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
