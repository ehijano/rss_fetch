      <title>Quantum Tomography in Neutral Meson and Antimeson Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor space of particles produced in collider environments contains informative quantum correlations. We present a systematic approach for constructing the complete flavor density matrix for a meson and antimeson system ($M \bar M$) in the Bloch vector space at a given time $t$, which can be at or after production. We point out that the $B_s^0$ and $K^0$ systems are superior to the $B^0_d$ and $D^0$ systems for quantum tomography because of their flavor oscillation and decay properties. Performing quantum tomography for the $M \bar M$ system can facilitate the study of production mechanisms, decoherence phenomena, quantum information variables, and potential new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Natural Ultralight Dark Matter: The Quadratic Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is uniquely accessible to tabletop experiments such as clocks and interferometers, and its search has been the focus of a vast experimental effort. However, the scalar ULDM mass is not protected from radiative corrections, and the entirety of the parameter space within reach of experiments suffers from a severe naturalness problem. In this paper, we propose a new twin mechanism that protects the mass of the scalar ULDM. Our scalar ULDM is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with quadratic couplings to the Standard Model (SM) and to a twin copy of the SM, with a mirror $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging each SM particle with its twin. Due to the mirror symmetry, the leading-order mass correction is quadratic in the (tiny) coupling while the linear order is canceled. This opens up vast regions of parameter space for natural quadratically coupled ultralight dark matter, within the sensitivity of existing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Invisible jets from composite neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel experimental probe of neutrino couplings to a composite sterile sector, leveraging the unique signature of neutrino disintegration into "invisible jets" in high-energy neutrino scattering. Focusing on scenarios where the invisible jet invariant mass significantly exceeds the confinement scale, we compute production rates within the conformal window. In this regime, invisible jet production leads to an energy-dependent enhancement of the neutral-to-charged current ratio in neutrino-nucleus scattering. Using NuTeV measurements, we derive new bounds and assess the sensitivity of upcoming experiments such as SHiP and the Forward Physics Facility at CERN. We sketch models where these probes surpass constraints from electroweak gauge boson and Higgs invisible branching ratios. In contrast, neutrino-electron scattering modifications are suppressed by the lower center-of-mass energy and are unlikely to be observable at DUNE.</description>

      <title>Phase-space sectors for ordered momentum mappings in local subtraction up to N$^3$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered momentum mappings present optimal convergence in soft and collinear configurations and are particularly suitable for the numerical implementation of local subtraction schemes. However, ordered mappings cannot be directly applied in the presence of multiple unordered emissions, which typically appear beyond the leading-colour approximation. A possible solution consists in separating individual singularities at the level of local counterterms by means of partial fractioning, which can become cumbersome at higher orders and introduce large cancellations in intermediate steps of the calculations. We present a simple decomposition of the phase space into sectors to isolate classes of infrared configurations which can be addressed with a specific ordered momentum mapping. With such decomposition, the singularities of any matrix element can be subtracted with ordered mappings, without the need of partial fractioning. We illustrate the required phase-space sectors for up to three unordered emissions and discuss applications in the context of the antenna subtraction method. The mapping algorithm described here has been recently employed for the first differential N$^3$LO of jet production at electron-positron colliders.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution and fragmentation functions with massive gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correct description of the hadron's structure requires understanding how quarks and gluons form the observable hadrons and how they are distributed within them. Two key nonperturbative quantities encapsulate this information: parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). The former define a probabilistic light-front momentum distribution of partons within a hadron, whereas the latter describe the hadronization process of high-energy partons. Computing these functions analytically poses significant challenges, as it demands models that accurately incorporate the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we compute the pion PDF and its elementary and full FFs using the Curci-Ferrari (CF) model. This model enables the exploration of nonperturbative QCD effects by introducing a gluon-mass scale within the Landau gauge QCD Lagrangian. The two-point quark and gluon correlation functions derived from the CF model agree well with lattice QCD results and reproduce the pion decay constant in the chiral limit, consistent with chiral perturbation theory. The resulting pion PDF and FFs computed with the CF quark propagator and pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with those obtained using the Qin-Chang model, a benchmark approach to nonperturbative QCD. These findings support the broader applicability of the Curci-Ferrari model in hadron phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Fast evaluation of Feynman integrals for Monte Carlo generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the idea of numerically integrating differential equations satisfied by Feynman integrals, we propose a novel strategy for handling branch cuts within a numerical framework. We develop an integrator capable of evaluating a basis of integrals in both double and quadruple precision, achieving significantly reduced computational times compared to existing tools. We demonstrate the performance of our integrator by evaluating one- and two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with up to nine complex kinematic scales. In particular, we apply our method to the radiative return process of massive electron-positron annihilation into pions plus an energetic photon within scalar QED, for which we also build the differential equation, and extend it to the case where virtual photons acquire an auxiliary complex mass under the Generalised Vector-Meson Dominance model. Furthermore, we validate our approach on two integral families relevant for the two-loop production of $t\bar{t}+\text{jet}$. The integrator achieves, in double precision, execution times of the order of milliseconds for one-loop topologies and hundreds of milliseconds for the two-loop families, enabling for on-the-fly computation of Feynman integrals in Monte Carlo generators and a more efficient generation of grids for the topologies with prohibitive computational costs.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Decays in the Bilepton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the current absence of new physics signals at the LHC, it is increasingly important to investigate alternative scenarios beyond those commonly explored. In this work, we study a variant of the 331 model that predicts the existence of vector bileptons with electric charge and lepton number +/-2, as well as TeV-scale exotic quarks carrying charges +/- 5/3 and +/- 4/3. Specifically, we focus on the primary production of heavy quarks with charge +/- 5/3, which decay into a bottom quark and a bilepton, followed by the bilepton's decay into same-sign muon pairs. As a case study, we select a benchmark point that complies with current experimental exclusion limits and theoretical expectations for the bilepton mass. Our analysis shows that the resulting signal stands out clearly from Standard Model backgrounds and could be observed at a future 100 TeV hadron collider such as FCC-hh. In contrast, the LHC, even in its high-luminosity phase, lacks the sensitivity required to detect this signal.</description>

      <title>Constraining ALP-Top Interaction from the Chromoelectric Dipole Moment of the Top Quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The couplings of axion-like particles (ALPs) to fermions are proportional to the fermion masses, making the interaction with the top quark particularly significant. In this study, we consider an ALP that is a mixture of CP-even and CP-odd components, thereby introducing CP violation. This CP violation, in turn, gives rise to electric dipole moments (EDMs) of quarks and leptons, as well as chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) of quarks. We compute the one-loop and two-loop contributions to the top quark CEDM induced by the ALP. In our calculation, we treat the external gluon as off-shell with momentum $q^2 \neq 0$, derive the analytical results, and finally evaluate the top quark CEDM at $q^2 = m_t^2$, corresponding to the top quark pole mass. This value is relevant for subsequent calculations of the EDMs of the neutron and mercury. By applying current experimental bounds on EDMs and CEDMs, we derive constraints on the ALP-top quark coupling, with the strongest limit coming from the neutron EDM.</description>

      <title>Evolution of coupled scalar perturbations through smooth reheating. II. Thermal fluctuation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations with short wavelengths exit the Hubble horizon when the universe may contain a thermal plasma in addition to an inflaton field that drives its expansion. We solve the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation dynamics at linear order, building upon a previously established set of gauge-invariant evolution equations. The properties of the noise autocorrelator are constrained via a matching of equilibrium correlators to quantum-statistical physics deep inside the Hubble horizon. The curvature power spectrum is determined numerically, without slow-roll approximations or assumptions about the equilibration of the inflaton field. As applications, we scrutinize two issues from recent literature: the model dependence of the thermally modified power spectrum as a function of freeze-out parameters, and the viability of embedding warm inflation within the Standard Model (we offer support for the latter proposal). The role of pre-horizon-exit acoustic oscillations is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Dark matter detection using optically trapped Rydberg atom tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</description>

      <title>Emergence of charm-strange dibaryons with negative parity via baryon-baryon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the one-boson-exchange model, we systematically perform a coupled channel analysis of the $P-$wave interactions between a charm baryon and light baryon, the involved channels include $\Xi_cN$, $\Lambda_c\Sigma$, $\Xi_c^{\prime}N$, $\Sigma_c\Lambda$, $\Xi_c^*N$, $\Sigma_c^*\Lambda$, $\Sigma_c\Sigma$, and $\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$. Our results can predict several possible molecular candidates, such as a $\Xi_c^{\prime}N$ molecule with $I(J^P)=0(1^-)$, $\Xi_c^{*}N$ molecules with $0(0^-, 1^-, 2^-)$, $\Sigma_c\Sigma$ molecules with $0(1^-)$ and $1(1^-)$, and $\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ molecules with $0(0^-, 1^-, 2^-)$, and $1(2^-)$. The coupled channel effects significantly influence the formation of the $\Sigma_c\Sigma$ molecule with $1(1^-)$. Furthermore, we analyze the phase shifts for these coupled channel systems. Our analysis not only confirms the existence of the predicted molecules but also identifies potential resonant dibaryons, including a $\Sigma_c\Sigma$ shape-type resonance with $1(1^-)$, a $\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ shape-type resonance with $1(0^-)$, a $\Lambda_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c\Sigma$ coupled Feshbach-type resonance with $1(1^-)$, and $\Lambda_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ coupled Feshbach-type resonances with $1(0^-, 2^-)$.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the gallium anomaly using exact electron wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gallium anomaly, a persistent discrepancy exceeding $4\sigma$ in the $^{71}$Ga neutrino capture rates from $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar calibration sources by the GALLEX, SAGE, and recently BEST experiments, has challenged particle physics and nuclear theory for over three decades. We present a new calculation for the neutrino capture cross-section, abandoning the conventional leading-order approximation for electronic wave functions by numerically solving the Dirac-Coulomb equation for both bound and continuum electron states. Finally, we re-evaluate the gallium anomaly, updating its global significance and presenting the most up-to-date status of its interpretation in terms of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Generation of Axions and Axion-Like Particles through Mass Parametric Resonance induced by Scalar Perturbations in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe through misalignment production, thermal processes, the decay of topological defects, etc. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through a parametric mass resonance, which is a nonlinear effect. This process exhibits a substantially unstable region that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, this mechanism does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Constraining lepton flavor violating $2q 2\ell$ operators from low-energy cLFV processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavour-violating (cLFV) processes, which are definite proof of new physics beyond the Standard Model, have remained elusive experimentally till now. Effective Field Theory (EFT) has been very useful in providing information about such new physics through the higher-dimensional operators. These operators respect SM gauge invariance, and they are suppressed by appropriate powers of the energy scale $\Lambda$. In regard to lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is shown to be a useful tool for estimating any new physics effect at the scale $\Lambda$. It is worth noticing that a large class of cLFV processes involve both quarks and leptons and thus low-energy observables play a significant role in providing bounds on lepton-flavour-violating 2-quark-2-lepton ($2q2\ell$) operators. Therefore, in this work, we have collected several low-energy cLFV processes that can be addressed within the SMEFT framework and also collected the set of operators responsible for such processes. Keeping in mind the correlation that exists among the SMEFT operators, we want to extract the strongest constraints on these $2q2\ell$ operators.</description>

      <title>Preheated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a (mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD Calculation of Hadron Multiplicities in Light-Quark Jets at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the calculation of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections to hadron multiplicities in light-quark jets at lepton colliders, employing the ``projection-to-Born" (P2B) method implemented in the FMNLO program. Taking the next-to-leading-order (NLO) result as an example, we rigorously establish the validity of our P2B-based calculation. We then present NNLO predictions for the normalized asymmetry $D_{K^{-}}$ between hadron and antihadron production in light-quark jets and compare them with SLD data. We find that a suppression of these SLD measurements relative to NPC23 predictions for $D_{K^{-}}$ emerges in the intermediate $z_h$ domain ($0.2 \lesssim z_h \lesssim 0.7$). We expect that incorporating these SLD data into global QCD fits will enable improved determination of fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation from an Analytic Hydrodynamic Model with Hadronic and QGP Sources in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a nearly perfect fluid is formed, known as the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). After a short thermalization period, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes a transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement. Direct photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning from the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon production, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and extends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, incorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that predicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model is constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the quark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of non-prompt direct photon spectra in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, across four centrality classes. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of the initial temperature. These results offer new insights into the space-time evolution of the thermal photon source and provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Melting down a tetraquark: $D^{\ast}D^{(\ast)}$ interactions and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ in a hot environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the modification of the properties of the tetraquark-like $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and its heavy quark spin partner, $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ immersed in a hot bath of pions. We consider these exotic states as purely isoscalar $DD^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ $S$-wave bound states, respectively. Finite temperature effects are incorporated through the $D$ and $D^\ast$ state-of-the-art thermal spectral functions calculated in [G. Montana et al., Phys. Rev. D, 102 (2020) 096020], using the imaginary-time formalism. We find important modifications of the $DD^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes already for $T=80$ MeV, and show that the hot-bath lineshapes of these tetraquark-like states strongly depend on their Weinberg molecular content. We find that the thermal $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ spectral functions change more rapidly with temperature for high molecular probabilities $P_0$. For large values of $P_0$, the widths significantly increase with temperature, leading to the melting of these exotic states for temperatures larger than 80 MeV. For small molecular components, the changes in the spectral functions of these states due to temperature become significantly less important. All these results show that any future experimental determination of the $D^{(\ast)}D^*$ scattering amplitudes at finite temperature will provide valuable insights into the molecular content of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ exotics.</description>

      <title>(Super)$\,$Gravity from Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the effective theory for isolated, massive, and weakly interacting spin-$3/2$ particles is compatible with causality and unitarity-i.e., the positivity of scattering amplitudes. We find no solution to positivity constraints, except when gravitons are also present and couple in a (nearly) supersymmetric way. Gravity is thus bootstrapped from $S$-matrix consistency conditions for the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of massive spin-$3/2$ states. For two such particles forming a $U(1)$-charged state, a (gravi)photon gauging the symmetry is also required, with couplings characteristic of supergravity and consistent with both the no global symmetry and weak gravity conjectures. We further explore the EFT-hedron associated with the longitudinal polarizations, the Goldstinos, through novel $t$-$u$ symmetric dispersion relations. We identify the extremal UV models that lie at the corners of the allowed parameter space, recovering familiar models of supersymmetry breaking and uncovering new ones.</description>

      <title>Supergravity from the Bottom Up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ on-shell methods to construct scattering amplitudes and derive effective theories involving massive spin-3/2 fermions interacting with spin 0, 1 and 2 bosons. The four-point massive amplitudes are constructed using an all-line-transverse momentum shift, assuming that in the massless limit, three-point interactions are smooth and the Ward identity is satisfied. For a Majorana spin-3/2 fermion with mass $m_{3/2}$, we show that interactions with only spin 0 and massive spin-1 bosons do not lead to an effective theory valid up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that is independent of particle masses. Instead, adding an interaction with a spin-2 graviton gives rise to four-point amplitudes with a Planck scale unitarity cutoff that reproduces well-known results from $N=1$ supergravity, such as $F$-term breaking with a complex scalar and $D$-term breaking with an additional massive photon. These bottom-up results are then extended to two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions where an interacting effective theory valid up to $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ again requires the introduction of the spin-2 graviton. Unitarity up to the Planck scale is then achieved when the two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions have unequal masses, and necessarily couple to two massive spin-1 states corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of $N=2$ supergravity to $N=0$. Our results, obtained from the bottom-up and without any Lagrangian, imply that broken supergravity is the unique, effective theory involving interactions of massive spin-3/2 fermions valid up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that does not depend on particle masses.</description>

      <title>Finding strangelets in cosmic rays from HESS J1731-347, a possible strange quark star using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that supernova remnants are key sources of Galactic cosmic rays gains support from evidence that HESS J1731-347 one of the few Galactic objects capable of accelerating hadronic cosmic rays to TeV energies may harbor an exotic strange quark star rather than a conventional neutron star. This conclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which challenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could generate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, potentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles. Detecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking evidence for quark matter. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its unmatched sensitivity and spectral resolution in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime, is uniquely positioned to search for their annihilation or decay signatures. We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray signals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally, we present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347, focusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production. A positive detection would not only validate the existence of strange quark stars but also establish a direct link between quark matter and cosmic-ray acceleration, reshaping our understanding of compact objects and high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with $68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $&gt;70$ while the reheating temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature. We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.</description>

      <title>Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)&lt;1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}&lt;0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Effect of Non-commutativity on Accretion Disks around RGI-Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Induced (RGI) Schwarzschild black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as the radiated energy flux, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular, for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially in the inner regions close to the black hole.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe cosmological signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Air-Shower Observables using a Universality-Based Model at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on solutions of the cascade equations, the air-shower universality is a framework that for all air showers with the same energy, zenith angle, depth of shower maximum, and muon number predicts the same longitudinal, lateral, and energy distributions of electromagnetic shower particles. We employ a universality-based model of shower development that incorporates hadronic particle components to reconstruct observables from extensive air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The model can estimate key parameters, such as the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at the event level. We discuss the performance of the reconstruction algorithm using both air-shower simulations, and preliminary results obtained from the Phase-I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>High-precision baryon number cumulants from lattice QCD in a finite box: cumulant ratios, Lee-Yang zeros and critical endpoint predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.</description>

Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter particles can annihilate or decay producing e^\pm pairs which upscatter the low-energy photon fields in the Galaxy and generate an X-ray emission (via the Inverse Compton effect). Using X-ray data from XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Suzaku, we derive new constraints on this class of dark matter (DM). For annihilating DM, they are significant for m_DM &gt; 100 MeV, and dominant if DM is p-wave annihilating. For decaying DM, they are the most stringent to date in the range m_DM ~400 MeV - 3 GeV$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New gauge bosons coupled to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are simple and well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. In searches for HNLs in proton fixed-target experiments, we find that a large population of gauge bosons ($Z^\prime$) produced by proton bremsstrahlung may decay to HNLs, leading to a significant improvement in existing bounds on the ($m_{HNL}, U_{\alpha}$), where $U_\alpha$ represent the mixing between HNL and the active neutrinos with flavor $\alpha$. We study this possibility in fixed target experiments with the 8 GeV proton beams, including SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, as well as DUNE and DarkQuest at 120 GeV. We find the projected sensitivities to additional $Z^\prime$-mediated HNL production can bring the seesaw mechanism of the neutrino masses within a broadened experimental reach.</description>

      <title>Lepton collider as a window to reheating via freezing in dark matter detection. Part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) genesis via Ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in embeds the seed of reheating temperature and dynamics in its relic density. Thus, discovery of such a DM candidate can possibly open the window for post-inflationary dynamics. However, there are several challenges in this exercise, as freezing-in DM possesses feeble interaction with the visible sector and therefore very low production cross-section at the collider. We show that mono-photon (and dilepton) signal at the ILC, arising from DM effective operators connected to the SM field strength tensors, can still warrant a signal discovery. We study both the scalar and fermionic DM production during reheating via UV freeze-in, when the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of a general monomial potential. Interestingly, we see, right DM abundance can be achieved only in the case of bosonic reheating scenario, satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This provides a unique correlation between collider signal and the post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe within single-field inflationary models.</description>

      <title>How well does nonrelativistic QCD factorization work at next-to-leading order?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a thorough investigation of the universality of the long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) of nonrelativistic QCD factorization based on a next-to-leading order (NLO) fit of $J/\psi$ color octet (CO) LDMEs to high transverse momentum $p_T$ $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ production data at the LHC. We thereby apply a novel fit-and-predict procedure to systematically take into account scale variations, and predict various observables never studied in this context before. In particular, the LDMEs can well describe $J/\psi$ hadroproduction up to the highest measured values of $p_T$, as well as $\Upsilon(nS)$ production via potential NRQCD based relations. Furthermore, $J/\psi$ production in $\gamma \gamma$ and $\gamma p$ collisions is surprisingly reproduced down to $p_T=1$ GeV, as long as the region of large inelasticity $z$ is excluded, which may be of significance in future quarkonium studies, in particular at the EIC and the high-luminosity LHC. In addition, our summary reveals an interesting pattern as to which observables still evade a consistent description.</description>

      <title>Gauging Flavor Symmetries of the Standard Model: from Dark Energy to Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry from Higher Dimensions in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics has global Family flavor symmetries corresponding to the 3 families in the Standard Model. It has been shown that the breaking of these symmetries at low energy produces Dark Energy which is the dominant component of the energy density of the Universe. It has also been shown that this model of Dark Energy not only explains the accelerated expansion of the universe but has additional observational consequences and makes verifiable predictions. This model allows a space-time dependent Dark Energy as indicated by recent observations. Further, the collapse of space dependent Dark Energy configurations leads to the formation of Dark Energy Black Holes resulting in verifiable predictions. We examine the implications of these symmetries at high energies and in the Early Universe. We consider what might happen if these global symmetries get gauged and that the global symmetries today are just a consequence of the gauge fields acquiring a constant vacuum expectation value below some energy scale v. Since, we have not yet seen signatures of such gauge fields at any of our particle accelerators, this would imply that v is greater than the electroweak scale. In the early Universe, when these gauge fields would be dynamical, the Higgs would not yet have acquired a non-zero vacuum expectation value and all Standard Model particles would be massless. The gauging of these global symmetries is desirable from a high energy and quantum gravity perspective. The chiral dynamics has a natural interpretation in terms of D Branes and our 4-dimensional Universe embedded in higher dimensions. Anomaly cancellation in this scenario results from the sum of the cubic terms vanishing. Finally, the analysis in this article can provide an explanation for one of the long standing mysteries of the natural world: the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our Universe.</description>

Abstract: Working in the hybrid framework of the high energy $pA$ collisions we identify a new contribution to transverse single spin asymmetry (SSA). The phase necessary for the SSA is provided by the Pomeron-Odderon interference in the dense nuclear target. The complete formula for the $pA \to h X$ polarized cross section also contains the transversity distribution for the polarized projectile as well as the real part of the twist-3 fragmentation function. We numerically estimate the asymmetry $A_N$ and its nuclear dependence. Based on a model computation we find that $A_N$ can be a percent level in the forward and low-$P_{h\perp}$ region. For large nuclei we find significant suppression, with $A_N \propto A^{-7/6}$ parametrically. As a notable feature we find a node of $A_N$ as a function of the $P_{h\perp}$ around the values of the initial saturation scale that could be used to test this mechanism experimentally.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for spacetime gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on neutrino-DM interactions from TXS 0506+056 neutrino outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross-section using the $13 \pm 5$ neutrino event excess observed by IceCube in 2014-2015 from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056. Our analysis takes advantage of the dark matter overdensity spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the blazar. In our results, we take into account uncertainties related to the different types of neutrino emission models and the features of the dark matter spike, considering cross-sections that scale with energy as $\sigma \propto (E_{\nu} /E_0)^n$, for values of $n = 1, 0, -1, -2$. In our best-case scenario, we obtain limits competitive with those derived from other active galaxies, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and the IC-170922A event.</description>

      <title>Resonance parameters of the vector charmoniumlike state $G(3900)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the updated analysis of the $G(3900)$ by the BESIII collaboration, we perform a global analysis of the cross sections of the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$, $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, $e^+e^-\to D^*\bar{D}^*$ processes, especially focusing on the properties of the $G(3900)$. As the energy region of interest is limited by the next opening threshold, i.e. the $D_1\bar{D}$ threshold, we focus on the energy region $[3.7,4.25]~\mathrm{GeV}$, where three charmonia $\psi(1D)$, $\psi(3S)$ and $\psi(2D)$ explicitly contribute to the cross sections. By constructing the $P$-wave contact interaction between the $(D,D^*)$ doublet and its antiparticle in the heavy quark limit, we extract the physical scattering amplitude by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. No matter whether three or two charmonium states are included in our framework, we always find a dynamically generated state corresponding to the $G(3900)$, which suggests it to be a $P$-wave dynamically generated state. We also predict several dynamically generated states in the corresponding $1^{-+}$ channel. These states can be further searched for in the electron-positron annihilation process involving the emission of a single photon.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixed dark matter from doublet and singlet scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extension of the Standard Model with an inert scalar doublet, three right-handed neutrinos, and singlet scalar fields, $\varphi$ and $S$. In this model, neutrino masses are zero in the limit of the unbroken $Z_4$ discrete symmetry. We show that when the singlet scalar field $\varphi$ gets a VEV, the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$, and neutrino masses are generated at one-loops due to the mixings between the neutral components of the inert scalar doublet and the singlet scalar field $S$. There is a dark matter candidate from the lightest neutral scalar field, which is a mixture of the inert scalar doublet and the singlet scalar field $S$, in general. The $Z_4$ breaking mass terms are constrained by electroweak precision data and direct detection (DD) bounds for dark matter, favoring small mixings or almost degenerate masses for the DM scalars. As a result, we discuss the implications of the results for small neutrino masses and DD-safe dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arguably most promising avenue towards testing physics beyond the Standard Model in the anomalous magnetic moment of the $\tau$ proceeds via suitably constructed asymmetries in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ in the presence of a polarized electron beam. Such a program, as could be realized at Belle II assuming a polarization upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider, crucially relies on a careful consideration of radiative corrections. In this work, we present the complete one-loop result for the fully polarized $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ process and its implementation in the Monte-Carlo integrator McMule. As an application, we discuss projections relevant for measurements at Belle II, both with and without electron polarization, and outline the necessary steps for a generalization to next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of physics capabilities of a liquid argon and a water based liquid scintillator at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of the physics sensitivities of a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) and a Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, considering their potential deployment as the fourth far detector module in the DUNE facility. Using GLoBES-based simulations, we evaluate their performance in measuring standard neutrino oscillation parameters ($\theta_{23}, \delta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$), both in standard 3-neutrino case, as well as in presence of new physics scenarios involving light sterile neutrinos and neutral-current non-standard interactions (NC NSI). Our findings show that THEIA (a WbLS-based detector) significantly outperforms LArTPC in resolving the CP phase $\delta_{13}$,- especially near maximal CP violation, and in lifting the octant degeneracy of $\theta_{23}$ due to its superior energy resolution and ability to clearly identify the second oscillation maximum. Furthermore, THEIA offers competitive reconstruction precision even with relatively moderate energy resolutions ($7-10\%/\sqrt{E}$) and demonstrates enhanced robustness under new physics scenarios. These results support the physics-driven case for a hybrid DUNE configuration utilizing both LArTPC and WbLS technologies for optimized sensitivity across the full spectrum of neutrino oscillation and physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive investigation on baryon number violating nucleon decays involving an axion-like particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate baryon number violating (BNV) nucleon decays into an axion-like particle (ALP), within a low energy effective field theory extended with an ALP, named as aLEFT. Unlike previous studies in the literature, we consider contributions to nucleon decays from a complete set of dimension-eight BNV aLEFT operators involving light $u,\,d,\,s$ quarks. We perform the chiral irreducible representation (irrep) decomposition of all those interactions under the QCD chiral group $\rm SU(3)_{\tt L}\times SU(3)_{\tt R}$, and match them onto the recently developed chiral framework to obtain nucleon-level effective interactions among the ALP, octet baryons, and octet pseudoscalar mesons. Within this framework, we derive general expressions for the decay widths of nucleon two- and three-body decays involving an ALP. We then analyze the momentum distributions for the three-body modes and find that the operators belonging to the newly identified chiral irreps $\pmb{6}_{\tt L(R)}\times \pmb{3}_{\tt R(L)}$ exhibit markedly different behavior compared to that in the usual irreps $\pmb{8}_{\tt L(R)}\times \pmb{1}_{\tt R(L)}$ and $\pmb{3}_{\tt L(R)}\times \bar{\pmb{3}}_{\tt R(L)}$. Furthermore, due to the lack of direct constraints on those exotic decay modes, we reanalyze the experimental data collected by Super-Kamiokande and establish bounds on the inverse decay widths of these new modes by properly accounting for experimental efficiencies and Cherenkov threshold effects. Our recasting constraints are several orders of magnitude more stringent than the inclusive bounds used in the literature. Based on these improved bounds, we set stringent limits on the associated effective scales across a broad range of ALP mass and predict stringent bounds on certain neutron and hyperon decays involving an ALP.</description>

Abstract: Using the decomposition of the $D$-dimensional space-time into parallel and perpendicular subspaces, we study and prove a connection between Landau and leading singularities for $N$-point one-loop Feynman integrals by applying multi-dimensional theory of residues. We show that if $D=N$ and $D=N+1$, the leading singularity corresponds to the inverse of the square root of the leading Landau singularity of the first and second type, respectively. We make use of this outcome to systematically provide differential equations of Feynman integrals in canonical forms and the extension of the connection of these singularities at multi-loop level by exploiting the loop-by-loop approach. Illustrative examples with the calculation of Landau and leading singularities are provided to supplement our results.</description>

      <title>Clustering of Primordial Black Holes from QCD Axion Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the clustering of primordial black holes (PBHs) and axion miniclusters produced in the model proposed to explain the LIGO/Virgo events or the seeds of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in arXiv:2006.13137. It is found that this model predicts large isocurvature perturbations due to the clustering of PBHs and axion miniclusters, from which we obtain stringent constraints on the model parameters. Specifically, for the axion decay constant $f_a=10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$, which potentially accounts for the seeds of the SMBHs, the PBH fraction in dark matter should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim7\times 10^{-10}$. Assuming that the mass of PBHs increases by more than a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ due to accretion, this is consistent with the observed abundance of SMBHs. On the other hand, for $f_a=10^{17}~\mathrm{GeV}$ required to produce PBHs of masses detected in the LIGO/Virgo, the PBH fraction should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim6\times 10^{-8}$, which may be too small to explain the LIGO/Virgo events, although there is a significant uncertainty in calculating the merger rate in the presence of clustering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free energy, or equivalently the ground state energy in finite volume, may be calculated from forward scattering amplitudes using a formula due to Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein. However a naive treatment leads to singularities when considering the scattering of three or more particles. It is shown in detail how the approach can be applied to multi-particle scattering in various massive scalar theories in 1+1d, with or without integrability. The results for the sinh-Gordon, Lieb-Liniger, and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models are compared to exact results. It is shown how bound states can be considered in this approach by considering the attractive Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Spacetime I: The Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency (at the time of emission) $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power law spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>

Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>

Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions at Unusual Values of $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the $\theta$ dependence in a cousin of QCD, where the vacuum structure can be analyzed exactly. The theory is $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_F=0,1,2,3$ flavors of fundamentals, explicitly broken to $\mathcal{N}=1$ via an adjoint superpotential, and coupled to anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB). The hierarchy $m_{AMSB}\ll \mu_{\mathcal{N}=1}\ll \Lambda$ ensures the validity of our IR analysis. As expected from ordinary QCD, the vacuum energy is a function of $\theta$ which undergoes 1st order phase transitions between different vacua where the various dyons condense. For $N_F=0$ we find the expected phase transition at $\theta=\pi$, while for $N_F=1,2,3$ we find phase transitions at fractional values of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter $\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.</description>
