      <title>Resolving the paradox of the Dirac equation: phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the results of F. Wilf on the need to take into account the quantum-mechanical correspondence rules in the Dirac equation for an electron, it was shown that the equation obtained by giving physical meaning to $\alpha$-Dirac operators should be considered as a phenomenological equation for a particle of non-zero size - the EM polaron, previously introduced by the author. This allows a solution to be found to the inherent paradox of the Dirac equation, which consists of the equality of the velocity of the moving particles to the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum, which is a priori unobtainable, and to understand the physical essence of spin as the intrinsic mechanical moment of an EM polaron. It is also shown that the Dirac-Wilf equation for a single spatial dimension can be considered a generalization of the Schrodinger equation for relativistic energies.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive deep-brain stimulations by spatio-temporal fourier synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new type of non-invasive deep-brain stimulation is conceived and demonstrated by computer simulations. The process is based on spatio-temporal Fourier synthesis using multiple electrode pairs with sinusoidal current drive to limit skin sensations and concentrate the stimulus power to a small spatial volume and into large rare spikes in the times domain, while the signal power at the skin is steady and small. Exotic time signals are also shown, such as the cases of high-frequency prime harmonics, quasi-random and chirping stimulations. The first one is able to generate sharp spikes with low frequency while its carriers are high-frequency harmonics that easily conducts via the skin and brain tissue. Open questions are, among others, the best shapes and timing of spikes. The answers require experimental tests and explorations in animal models and human subjects.</description>
