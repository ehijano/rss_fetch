      <title>Pharmacophore-constrained de novo drug design with diffusion bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De novo design of bioactive drug molecules with potential to treat desired biological targets is a profound task in the drug discovery process. Existing approaches tend to leverage the pocket structure of the target protein to condition the molecule generation. However, even the pocket area of the target protein may contain redundant information since not all atoms in the pocket is responsible for the interaction with the ligand. In this work, we propose PP2Drug - a phamacophore-constrained de novo design approach to generate drug candidate with desired bioactivity. Our method adapts diffusion bridge to effectively convert pharmacophore designs in the spatial space into molecular structures under the manner of equivariant transformation, which provides sophisticated control over optimal biochemical feature arrangement on the generated molecules. PP2Drug is demonstrated to generate hit candidates that exhibit high binding affinity with potential protein targets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Drug-Target Interaction Prediction through Transfer Learning from Activity Cliff Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning (ML) has gained popularity in the early stages of drug discovery. This trend is unsurprising given the increasing volume of relevant experimental data and the continuous improvement of ML algorithms. However, conventional models, which rely on the principle of molecular similarity, often fail to capture the complexities of chemical interactions, particularly those involving activity cliffs (ACs) - compounds that are structurally similar but exhibit evidently different activity behaviors. In this work, we address two distinct yet related tasks: (1) activity cliff (AC) prediction and (2) drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. Leveraging insights gained from the AC prediction task, we aim to improve the performance of DTI prediction through transfer learning. A universal model was developed for AC prediction, capable of identifying activity cliffs across diverse targets. Insights from this model were then incorporated into DTI prediction, enabling better handling of challenging cases involving ACs while maintaining similar overall performance. This approach establishes a strong foundation for integrating AC awareness into predictive models for drug discovery. Scientific Contribution This study presents a novel approach that applies transfer learning from AC prediction to enhance DTI prediction, addressing limitations of traditional similarity-based models. By introducing AC-awareness, we improve DTI model performance in structurally complex regions, demonstrating the benefits of integrating compound-specific and protein-contextual information. Unlike previous studies, which treat AC and DTI predictions as separate problems, this work establishes a unified framework to address both data scarcity and prediction challenges in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>AI Model for Predicting Binding Affinity of Antidiabetic Compounds Targeting PPAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the binding affinity of ligands targeting the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) family, using 2D molecular descriptors. A dataset of 3,764 small molecules with known binding affinities, sourced from the ChEMBL database, was preprocessed by eliminating duplicates and incomplete data. Molecular docking simulations using AutoDock Vina were performed to predict binding affinities for the PPAR receptor family. 2D molecular descriptors were computed from the SMILES notation of each ligand, capturing essential structural and physicochemical features. These descriptors, along with the predicted binding affinities, were used to train a deep learning model to predict binding affinity as a regression task. The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. Results indicated strong performance with an R squared value of 0.861 for the training set and 0.655 for the test set, suggesting good model generalization. The model shows promise for predicting ligand-receptor interactions and can be applied in drug discovery efforts targeting PPAR-related diseases.</description>

      <title>BioTD: an online database of biotoxins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotoxins, mainly produced by venomous animals, plants and microorganisms, exhibit high physiological activity and unique effects such as lowering blood pressure and analgesia. A number of venom-derived drugs are already available on the market, with many more candidates currently undergoing clinical and laboratory studies. However, drug design resources related to biotoxins are insufficient, particularly a lack of accurate and extensive activity data. To fulfill this demand, we develop the Biotoxins Database (BioTD). BioTD is the largest open-source database for toxins, offering open access to 14,607 data records (8,185 activity records), covering 8,975 toxins sourced from 5,220 references and patents across over 900 species. The activity data in BioTD is categorized into five groups: Activity, Safety, Kinetics, Hemolysis and other physiological indicators. Moreover, BioTD provides data on 986 mutants, refines the whole sequence and signal peptide sequences of toxins, and annotates disulfide bond information. Given the importance of biotoxins and their associated data, this new database was expected to attract broad interests from diverse research fields in drug discovery. BioTD is freely accessible at http://biotoxin.net/.</description>

      <title>Molecular Communication-Based Quorum Sensing Disruption for Enhanced Immune Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) utilizes chemical molecules to transmit information, introducing innovative strategies for pharmaceutical interventions and enhanced immune system monitoring. This paper explores Molecular communication based approach to disrupt Quorum Sensing (QS) pathways to bolster immune defenses against antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Quorum Sensing enables bacteria to coordinate critical behaviors, including virulence and antibiotic resistance, by exchanging chemical signals, known as autoinducers. By interfering with this bacterial communication, we can disrupt the synchronization of activities that promote infection and resistance. The study focuses on RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), which blocks the production of critical transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, within the Accessory Gene Regulator (AGR) system, thereby weakening bacterial virulence and enhancing host immune responses. The synergistic effects of combining QS inhibitors like RIP with traditional antimicrobial treatments reduce the need for highdose antibiotics, offering a potential solution to antibiotic resistance. This molecular communication-based approach presents a promising path to improved treatment efficacy and more robust immune responses against bacterial infections by targeting bacterial communication.</description>

      <title>ProtScan: Modeling and Prediction of RNA-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP-seq methods are valuable techniques to experimentally determine transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Despite the constant improvement of such techniques (e.g. eCLIP), the results are affected by various types of noise and depend on experimental conditions such as cell line, tissue, gene expression levels, stress conditions etc., paving the way for the in silico modeling of RNA-protein interactions. Here we present ProtScan, a predictive tool based on consensus kernelized SGD regression. ProtScan denoises and generalizes the information contained in CLIP-seq experiments. It outperforms competitor state-of the-art methods and can be used to model RNA-protein interactions on a transcriptome-wide scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are increasingly appreciated for their abundance in the proteome and the many functional roles they play in the cell. In this short review, we describe a variety of approaches used to obtain biological insight from the structural ensembles of disordered proteins, regions, and complexes and the integrative biology challenges that arise from combining diverse experiments and computational models. Importantly, we highlight findings regarding structural and dynamic characterization of disordered regions involved in binding and phase separation, as well as drug targeting of disordered regions, using a broad framework of integrative modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>ProtCLIP: Function-Informed Protein Multi-Modal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modality pre-training paradigm that aligns protein sequences and biological descriptions has learned general protein representations and achieved promising performance in various downstream applications. However, these works were still unable to replicate the extraordinary success of language-supervised visual foundation models due to the ineffective usage of aligned protein-text paired data and the lack of an effective function-informed pre-training paradigm. To address these issues, this paper curates a large-scale protein-text paired dataset called ProtAnno with a property-driven sampling strategy, and introduces a novel function-informed protein pre-training paradigm. Specifically, the sampling strategy determines selecting probability based on the sample confidence and property coverage, balancing the data quality and data quantity in face of large-scale noisy data. Furthermore, motivated by significance of the protein specific functional mechanism, the proposed paradigm explicitly model protein static and dynamic functional segments by two segment-wise pre-training objectives, injecting fine-grained information in a function-informed manner. Leveraging all these innovations, we develop ProtCLIP, a multi-modality foundation model that comprehensively represents function-aware protein embeddings. On 22 different protein benchmarks within 5 types, including protein functionality classification, mutation effect prediction, cross-modal transformation, semantic similarity inference and protein-protein interaction prediction, our ProtCLIP consistently achieves SOTA performance, with remarkable improvements of 75% on average in five cross-modal transformation benchmarks, 59.9% in GO-CC and 39.7% in GO-BP protein function prediction. The experimental results verify the extraordinary potential of ProtCLIP serving as the protein multi-modality foundation model.</description>

Abstract: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.</description>

      <title>PepTune: De Novo Generation of Therapeutic Peptides with Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptide therapeutics, a major class of medicines, have achieved remarkable success across diseases such as diabetes and cancer, with landmark examples such as GLP-1 receptor agonists revolutionizing the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug development and structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.</description>

      <title>Accurate RNA 3D structure prediction using a language model-based deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.</description>
