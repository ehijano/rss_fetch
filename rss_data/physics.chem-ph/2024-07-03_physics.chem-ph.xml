      <title>Suitability of available interatomic potentials for Sn to model its 2D allotropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suitability of a range of interatomic potentials for elemental tin was evaluated in order to identify an appropriate potential for modeling the stanene (2D tin) allotropes. Structural and mechanical properties of the flat (F), low-buckled (LB), high-buckled (HB), full dumbbell (FD), trigonal dumbbell (TD), honeycomb dumbbell (HD) and large honeycomb dumbbell (LHD) monolayer tin (stanene) phases, were gained by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular statics (MS) calculations with ten different Tersoff, modified embedded atom method (MEAM) and machine-learning-based (ML-IAP) interatomic potentials. A systematic quantitative comparison and discussion of the results are reported.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven high-resolution Raman spectral generation for accurate molecular feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the probing of light-matter interactions, Raman spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the composition, structure, and dynamics of materials, and obtaining such data from portable and cheap instruments is of immense practical relevance. Here, we propose the integration of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with low-resolution Raman spectroscopy with a portable hand-held spectrometer to facilitate concurrent spectral analysis and compound classification. Portable spectrometers generally have a lower resolution, and the Raman signal is usually buried under the background noise. The GAN-based model could not only generate high-resolution data but also reduced the spectral noise significantly. The generated data was used further to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based model for the classification of organic and pharmaceutical drug molecules. The high-resolution generated Raman data was subsequently used for spectral barcoding for identification of the pharmaceutical drugs. GAN also demonstrated enhanced robustness in extracting weak signals compared to conventional noise removal methods. This integrated system holds the potential for achieving accurate and real-time monitoring of noisy inputs to obtain high throughput output, thereby opening new avenues for applications in different domains. This synergy between spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) facilitates improved data processing, noise reduction, and feature extraction and opens avenues for predictive modeling and automated decision-making using cost-effective portable devices.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Recombination of CF$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents our theoretical study of the dissociative recombination (DR) of the closed-shell diatomic system CF$^+$ based on an approach recently applied to the CH$^+$ molecule. Our extended treatment uses the UK R-matrix theory and the multichannel quantum-defect theory procedure to uniformly resolve the direct and indirect mechanisms of DR while bypassing explicit dissociative state and electronic coupling calculations. The theoretical results exhibit good overall agreement with previous experimental measurements. At lower scattering energies, good agreement is found only if the rotational structure of the ion is included and the theoretical cross sections are averaged over initial rotational levels corresponding to the temperature at which the experimental measurements were made. At higher scattering energies, our rotationally resolved results are very similar to those obtained without including the ion's rotational structure.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Linear Response in Quantum-Electrodynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theoretical derivation and numerical implementation of the linear response equations for relativistic quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT). In contrast to previous works based on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, our approach describes electrons interacting with photonic cavity modes at the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham level, derived from fully relativistic QED through a series of established approximations. Moreover, we show that a new type of spin-orbit-like (SO) cavity-mediated interaction appears under the relativistic description of the coupling of matter with quantized cavity modes. Benchmark calculations performed for atoms of group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg) demonstrate how a relativistic treatment enables the description of exciton polaritons which arise from the hybridization of formally forbidden singlet-triplet transitions with cavity modes. For atoms in cavities tuned on resonance with a singlet-triplet transition we discover a significant interplay between SO effects and coupling to an off-resonant intense singlet-singlet transition. This dynamic relationship highlights the crucial role of ab initio approaches in understanding cavity quantum electrodynamics. Finally, using the mercury porphyrin complex as an example, we show that relativistic linear response QEDFT provides computationally feasible first-principles calculations of polaritonic states in large heavy element-containing molecules of chemical interest.</description>

      <title>A Review of Large Language Models and Autonomous Agents in Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful tool in chemistry across multiple domains. In chemistry, LLMs are able to accurately predict properties, design new molecules, optimize synthesis pathways, and accelerate drug and material discovery. A core emerging idea is combining LLMs with chemistry-specific tools like synthesis planners and databases, leading to so-called "agents." This review covers LLMs' recent history, current capabilities, design, challenges specific to chemistry, and future directions. Particular attention is given to agents and their emergence as a cross-chemistry paradigm. Agents have proven effective in diverse domains of chemistry, but challenges remain. It is unclear if creating domain-specific versus generalist agents and developing autonomous pipelines versus "co-pilot" systems will accelerate chemistry. An emerging direction is the development of multi-agent systems using a human-in-the-loop approach. Due to the incredibly fast development of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding individual ions in solutions is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, tracking and detecting ions at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a challenge. We introduce a strategy for visualization and differentiation of different ions in liquid environment via point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the ion sensor. Ions interacting with the optically active point defects in h-BN alter emission properties, allowing us to capture these changes and visualize single ions. Using Li+ in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed a spectral shift of over 10 nm upon Li+ addition, and an over 50 nm red shift with applied electric fields due to reactions between Li+ and h-BN point defects. Frequency domain analysis further revealed the rapid dynamics of ion migration and the slow electrochemical reactions. We further spectroscopically differentiated various ions (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Al3+) in aqueous solution. Each ion, with its distinct electron cloud configuration, interacts distinctively with the electron clouds of h-BN defects, resulting in specific and identifiable spectroscopic signatures. This ion sensing platform enables the direct visualization and differentiation of individual ions in a liquid environment, offering insights into chemical reactions at the single-ion level. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids, including but not limited to biology, battery technology, and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Effect of antiprotons on hydrogen-like ions in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, quasi-molecular compounds consisting of one antiproton ($\bar{p}$) and one hydrogen-like ion are investigated: $\mathrm{He}^{+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Li}^{2+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{C}^{5+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{S}^{15+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Kr}^{35+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Ho}^{66+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Re}^{74+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{U}^{91+} - \bar{p}$. For the calculations, the Dirac equation with two-center potential is solved numerically using the dual-kinetically balanced finite-basis-set method adapted to systems with axial symmetry (A-DKB). Adiabatic potential curves are constructed for the ground state of the above quasi-molecular compounds in the framework of the A-DKB approach. Calculations were also performed for the case of an external magnetic field (the field is taken into account non-perturbatively). Zeeman shifts of the quasi-molecular terms are obtained for a homogeneous magnetic field with a strength of the laboratory order (up to 100 Tesla) directed along the axis of the molecule.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Molecular Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures possessing {\pi}-electron magnetism have attracted tremendous interest due to their great potential for nano spintronics. In particular, quantum chains with magnetic molecular units synthesized by on-surface reactions provide an ideal playground for investigating magnetic exchange interactions between localized spin components. Here, we present an extensive study of antiferromagnetic nanographene chains with the diazahexabenzocoronene molecule as the repeating unit. A combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory and quantum spin models revealed their detailed structures and electronic and magnetic properties. We found that the antiferromagnetic chains host a collective state featuring gapped excitations for an even number of repeating units and one featuring a Kondo excitation for an odd number. Comparing with exact many-body quantum spin models, our molecular chains provide the realization of an entangled quantum Heisenberg model. Coupled with the tunability of the molecular building blocks, these systems can act as an ideal platform for the experimental realization of topological spin lattices.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Point Defect Properties Near Surfaces in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely recognized that surface and interfacial defects exhibit distinct behavior compared to bulk defects in metal halide perovskites. However, the transition from bulk to surface behavior and the spatial extent of the surface's influence are not well understood. To address this, we conducted first-principles calculations on iodine vacancies and interstitial defects in methylammonium lead iodide and cesium lead iodide at various depths from the surface, enabling us to map out depth-dependent behavior. We find that the defect formation energy follows a saturating exponential curve as the defect moves away from the surface to the bulk. Using first-principles calculated defect formation energies, we quantify the extent of the surface's influence by calculating the decay length associated with each defect. The difference between the surface and bulk defect formation energy is found to be as high as 1.12 eV for the negatively charged iodine vacancy in methylammonium lead iodide, leading to the enrichment of the surface with defects. Through analysis of defective structures, we find that the differences in the bulk and surface defect properties are a consequence of different bond lengths and in some cases, even changes in bonding and coordination environments. Finally, we determine how the defect transition levels change as a function of the layer index, which could contribute to increased non-radiative recombination. Our findings pave the way for a systematic treatment of non-radiative losses in perovskite solar cells that incorporate spatially dependent defect densities and transition levels.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for machine learning force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster Theory for Electronically Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to improve single-reference coupled cluster theory in settings where the Aufbau determinant is absent from or plays only a small role in the true wave function. Using a de-excitation operator that can be efficiently hidden within a similarity transform, we create a coupled cluster wave function in which de-excitations work to suppress the Aufbau determinant and produce wave functions dominated by other determinants. Thanks to an invertible and fully exponential form, the approach is systematically improvable, size consistent, size extensive, and, interestingly, size intensive in a granular way that should make the adoption of some ground state techniques such as local correlation relatively straightforward. In this initial study, we apply the general formalism to create a state-specific method for orbital-relaxed singly excited states. We find that this approach matches the accuracy of similar-cost equation-of-motion methods in valence excitations while offering improved accuracy for charge transfer states. We also find the approach to be more accurate than excited-state-specific perturbation theory in both types of states.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate in combustion. By further analyzing concentration changes of selected key species and radicals, this method reveals complex interactions among them across regions with temperature. To illustrate this approach, the study investigates the mechanisms of auto-ignition of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures in a counterflow configuration under low strain rates. In mixtures where n-heptane is dominant, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by addition of ethanol impacts the heat release rate in regions where the temperature is higher through the diffusion of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6, and H2O2. In mixtures where ethanol is dominant, the high ethanol fractions in the mixture increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within approximate or locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>

      <title>Tensor network influence functionals in the continuous-time limit: connections to quantum embedding, bath discretization, and higher-order time propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two developments of tensor network influence functionals (in particular, influence functional matrix product states (IF-MPS)) for quantum impurity dynamics within the fermionic setting of the Anderson impurity model. The first provides the correct extension of the IF-MPS to continuous time by introducing a related mathematical object, the boundary influence functional MPS. The second connects the dynamics described by a compressed IF-MPS to that of a quantum embedding method with a time-dependent effective bath undergoing nonunitary dynamics. Using these concepts, we implement higher-order time propagators for the quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity model within the boundary IF-MPS formalism. The calculations illustrate the ability of the current formulation to efficiently remove the time step error in standard discrete-time IF-MPS implementations as well as to interface with state vector propagation techniques. They also show the advantages of IF-MPS dynamics, with its associated highly compact effective bath dynamics, over state vector propagation with a static bath discretization.</description>

      <title>Correcting Delocalization Error in Materials with Localized Orbitals and Linear-Response Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delocalization error prevents density functional theory (DFT) from reaching its full potential, causing problems like systematically underestimated band gaps and misaligned energy levels at interfaces. We introduce lrLOSC to correct delocalization error in materials over a wide range of band gaps. We predict eleven materials' fundamental gaps to within 0.28 eV, while offering a nonzero correction to the total energy. Molecular properties are improved with the same theory (arXiv:2406.06345). lrLOSC is an essential step toward modeling molecules, materials, and their interfaces within the same DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic states in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of training, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>
