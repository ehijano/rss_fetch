      <title>Controlled Delivery of Reactive Oxygen Species by Functionalized Catalytic Plasma Coatings for Antimicrobial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.</description>

      <title>PDBBind Optimization to Create a High-Quality Protein-Ligand Binding Dataset for Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of scoring functions (SFs) used to predict protein-ligand binding energies requires high-quality 3D structures and binding assay data, and often relies on the PDBBind dataset for training and testing their parameters. In this work we show that PDBBind suffers from several common structural artifacts of both proteins and ligands and non-uniform reporting of binding energies of its derived training and tests, which may compromise the accuracy, reliability and generalizability of the resulting SFs. Therefore we have developed a series of algorithms organized in an automated workflow, PDBBind-Opt, that curates non-covalent protein-ligand datasets to fix common problems observed in the general, refined, and core sets of PDBBind. We also use PDBBind-Opt to create an independent data set by matching binding free energies from BioLiP2 with co-crystalized ligand-protein complexes from the PDB. The resulting PDBBind-Opt workflow and BioLiP2-Opt dataset are designed to ensure reproducibility and to minimize human intervention, while also being open-source to foster transparency in the improvements made to this important resource for the biology and drug discovery communities.</description>

      <title>Separation of ionic timescales explains dynamics of cellular volume regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells actively regulate their volume in response to changes in the extra-cellular environment, such as osmolarity and chemo-attractant concentration. While the basic physical mechanisms of volume regulation are understood from the classic "pump-leak" model, it lacks intuitive insight into the volume dynamics and does not provide explicit, quantitative predictions. Here, we propose a theory of cellular volume regulation based on separation of timescales, offering a simple explanation of volume dynamics: cellular volume is a fast variable, influenced by rapid water permeation and anion leakage in response to changes in membrane potential. In contrast, membrane potential is a slow variable, constrained by the leakage of cellular K$^+$ and Na$^+$. Our theoretical predictions are validated by two recent independent shock experiments: osmotic shocks in HeLa cells and neutrophil activation upon sudden exposure to chemoattractants. Our theory aims to elucidate cellular volume dynamics on the scale of tens of minutes in various biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Role of Non-Exponential Reversal times in Aggregation Models of Bacterial Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider 1D agent-based and kinetic models of aggregation with reversals. In particular, we fit a Gamma distribution to represent the run times in myxobacteria and analyze numerically the importance of non-exponential reversal times. We demonstrate that non-exponential reversal times aid aggregation and result in tighter aggregates. We compare and contrast the behavior of agent-based and kinetic models, and also consider kinetic models with aggregation driven by chemotaxis. Thus, incorporating non-exponential reversal times into models of aggregation can be particularly important for reproducing experimental data, such as aggregate persistence and dispersal.</description>

      <title>Modelling floral and arthropod electrostatics using a two-domain AAA-least squares algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through co-evolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, colour and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modelling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.</description>

      <title>Microscale velocity-dependent unbinding generates a macroscale performance-efficiency tradeoff in actomyosin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myosin motors are fundamental biological actuators, powering diverse mechanical tasks in eukaryotic cells via ATP hydrolysis. Recent work revealed that myosin's velocity-dependent detachment rate can bridge actomyosin dynamics to macroscale Hill muscle predictions. However, the influence of this microscale unbinding, which we characterize by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, on macroscale energetic flows-such as power consumption, output and efficiency-remains elusive. Here we develop an analytical model of myosin dynamics that relates unbinding rates $\alpha$ to energetics. Our model agrees with published in-vivo muscle data and, furthermore, uncovers a performance-efficiency tradeoff governed by $\alpha$. To experimentally validate the tradeoff, we build HillBot, a robophysical model of Hill's muscle that mimics nonlinearity. Through HillBot, we decouple $\alpha$'s concurrent effect on performance and efficiency, demonstrating that nonlinearity drives efficiency. We compile 136 published measurements of $\alpha$ in muscle and myoblasts to reveal a distribution centered at $\alpha^* = 3.85 \pm 2.32$. Synthesizing data from our model and HillBot, we quantitatively show that $\alpha^*$ corresponds to a class of generalist actuators that are both relatively powerful and efficient, suggesting that the performance-efficiency tradeoff underpins the prevalence of $\alpha^*$ in nature. We leverage these insights and propose a nonlinear variable-impedance protocol to shift along a performance-efficiency axis in robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Re-thinking Richardson-Lucy without Iteration Cutoffs: Physically Motivated Bayesian Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution is widely used to restore images from degradation caused by the broadening effects of a point spread function and corruption by photon shot noise, in order to recover an underlying object. In practice, this is achieved by iteratively maximizing a Poisson emission likelihood. However, the RL algorithm is known to prefer sparse solutions and overfit noise, leading to high-frequency artifacts. The structure of these artifacts is sensitive to the number of RL iterations, and this parameter is typically hand-tuned to achieve reasonable perceptual quality of the inferred object. Overfitting can be mitigated by introducing tunable regularizers or other ad hoc iteration cutoffs in the optimization as otherwise incorporating fully realistic models can introduce computational bottlenecks. To resolve these problems, we present Bayesian deconvolution, a rigorous deconvolution framework that combines a physically accurate image formation model avoiding the challenges inherent to the RL approach. Our approach achieves deconvolution while satisfying the following desiderata:
  I deconvolution is performed in the spatial domain (as opposed to the frequency domain) where all known noise sources are accurately modeled and integrated in the spirit of providing full probability distributions over the density of the putative object recovered;
  II the probability distribution is estimated without making assumptions on the sparsity or continuity of the underlying object;
  III unsupervised inference is performed and converges to a stable solution with no user-dependent parameter tuning or iteration cutoff;
  IV deconvolution produces strictly positive solutions; and
  V implementation is amenable to fast, parallelizable computation.</description>

      <title>Vertex pinning and stretching of single molecule DNA in a linear polymer solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapping, linearization, and imaging of single molecule DNA is of broad interest to both biophysicists who study polymer physics and engineers who build nucleic acid analyzing methods such as optical mapping. In this study, single DNA molecules in a neutral linear polymer solution were driven with an axial electric field through microchannels and their dynamics were studied using fluorescence microscopy. We observed that above a threshold electric field, individual DNA molecules become pinned to the channel walls at a vertex on each molecule and are stretched in the direction opposite to the electric field. Upon removal of the electric field, pinned DNA molecules undergo relaxation within a few seconds to a Brownian coil around the vertex. After 10s of seconds, DNA is released and free to electromigrate. The method enables high quality imaging of single-molecule DNA with high throughput using simple-to-fabricate fluidic structures. We analyze the conditions needed for trapping, relaxation dynamics, and the repeatability of vertex pinning. We hypothesize DNA entangles with neutral linear polymers adsorbed to walls. We hypothesize that a sufficiently high electric force on the DNA is required to expel a hydration layer between the DNA and the wall-adsorbed neutral linear polymers. The elimination of the hydration layer may increase the friction between charged DNA and the uncharged polymer, promoting vertex pinning of DNA.</description>

      <title>Upstroke wing clapping in bats and bat-inspired robots improves both lift generation and power economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wing articulation is critical for efficient flight of bird- and bat-sized animals. Inspired by the flight of $\textit{Cynopterus brachyotis}$, the lesser short-nosed fruit bat, we built a two-degree-of-freedom flapping wing platform with variable wing folding capability. In late upstroke, the wings "clap" and produce an air jet that significantly increases lift production, with a positive peak matched to that produced in downstroke. Though ventral clapping has been observed in avian flight, potential aerodynamic benefit of this behavior has yet to be rigorously assessed. We used multiple approaches -- quasi-steady modeling, direct force/power measurement, and PIV experiments in a wind tunnel -- to understand critical aspects of lift/power variation in relation to wing folding magnitude over Strouhal numbers between $St = 0.2 - 0.4$. While lift increases monotonically with folding amplitude in that range, power economy (ratio of lift/power) is more nuanced. At $St = 0.2 - 0.3$, it increase with wing folding amplitude monotonically. At $St = 0.3 - 0.4$, it features two maxima -- one at medium folding amplitude ($\sim 30^\circ$), and the other at maximum folding. These findings illuminate two strategies available to flapping wing animals and robots -- symmetry-breaking lift augmentation and appendage-based jet propulsion.</description>

Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain, which is theoretically well understood. Here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to finite temperatures for a very broad class of under-constrained systems. In the vicinity of the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles expressions for elastic properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ on temperature $T$, isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, and shear strain $\gamma$, which we confirm numerically. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain, which can be determined from the microstructure of the system. Our results imply that in under-constrained systems, entropic and energetic rigidity interact like two springs in series. This also allows for a simple explanation of the previously numerically observed scaling relation $t\sim G\sim T^{1/2}$ at $\varepsilon=\gamma=0$. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <title>More quantum chemistry with fewer qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, and molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favorable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Effective single particle dynamics in active matter systems using local density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a top-down approach to theoretically model the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of active disks and use this model to derive the effective dynamics of a single particle. By analyzing clustering dynamics in simulations, we introduce a local density variable that captures interaction effects. We numerically calculate the mean and temporal auto-correlation of local density in the steady state, and use these to analytically derive an exact expression for a particle's diffusivity as a function of global packing density. Remarkably, our effective model closely matches numerical diffusivity in high packing density regime where prominent clusters are formed and shows striking agreements with the well-known existence of phase transition beyond a critical packing density. This model could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. The solutions are written in terms of elementary functions.</description>
