      <title>Feedback Driven Convergence, Competition, and Entanglement in Classical Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical theory of statistical convergence in which the law of large numbers arises from outcome-outcome feedback rather than assumed independence. Defining the convergence field and its derivative, we show that empirical frequencies evolve through coupling, producing competition, finite-m fluctuations, and classical entanglement. Using the Kramers-Moyal expansion, we derive an Ito-Langevin and Fokker-Planck description, reducing in the symmetric regime to a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We propose variance-based witnesses that detect outcome-space entanglement in both binary sequences and coupled Brownian trajectories, and confirm entanglement through numerical experiments. Extending the formalism yields multi-outcome feedback dynamics and finite-time cross-diffusion between Brownian particles. The results unify convergence, fluctuation, and entanglement as consequences of a single feedback-driven stochastic principle.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-resolution indoor radon map using a new machine learning-based probabilistic model and German radon survey data</title>

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of indoor radon concentration is crucial for assessing radon-related health effects or identifying radon-prone areas. Indoor radon concentration at the national scale is usually estimated on the basis of extensive measurement campaigns. However, characteristics of the sampled households often differ from the characteristics of the target population owing to the large number of relevant factors that control the indoor radon concentration, such as the availability of geogenic radon or floor level. We propose a model-based approach that allows a more realistic estimation of indoor radon distribution with a higher spatial resolution than a purely data-based approach. A modeling approach was used by applying a quantile regression forest to estimate the probability distribution function of indoor radon for each floor level of each residential building in Germany. Based on the estimated probability distribution function,a probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling technique was applied, enabling the combination and population weighting of floor-level predictions. In this way,the uncertainty of the individual predictions is effectively propagated into the estimate of variability at the aggregated level. The results show an approximate lognormal distribution of indoor radon in dwellings in Germany with an arithmetic mean of 63 Bq/m3, a geometric mean of 41 Bq/m3, and a 95th percentile of 180 Bq/m3. The exceedance probabilities for 100 and 300 Bq/m3 are 12.5% (10.5 million people affected) and 2.2 % (1.9 million people affected), respectively. The advantages of our approach are that it yields a) an accurate estimation of indoor radon concentration even if the survey is not fully representative with respect to floor level and radon concentration in soil, and b) an estimate of the indoor radon distribution with a much higher spatial resolution than basic descriptive statistics.</description>

      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here, we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>
