      <title>Exponential Euler method for stiff SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Kamrani et al. (2024), exponential Euler method for stiff stochastic differential equations with additive fractional Brownian noise was discussed, and the convergence order close to the Hurst parameter H was proved. Utilizing the technique of Malliavin derivative, we prove the exponential Euler scheme and obtain a convergence order of one, which is the optimal rate in numerical simulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish an almost sure central limit theorem for a general random sequence under a strong approximation condition. Additionally, we derive the law of the iterated logarithm for the center of mass corresponding to a random sequence under a different strong approximation condition. Applications to step-reinforced random walks are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium moderate deviations for occupation times of SSEP on regula trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the symmetric simple exclusion process on the regula tree $\mathbb{T}^d$ for $d\geq 2$. Our main result gives moderate deviation principles of occupation times of the process starting from an invariant product measure. Two replacement lemmas play key roles in the proof of our main result. To obtain these replacement lemmas, we utilize duality relationships between the symmetric exclusion process and two types of random walks on $\mathbb{T}^d$ and $\left(\mathbb{T}^d\right)^2$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Precise large deviations through a uniform Tauberian theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a large deviation principle for families of random variables in the basin of attraction of spectrally positive stable distributions by proving a uniform version of the Tauberian theorem for Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. The main advantage of this method is that it can be easily applied to cases that are beyond the reach of the techniques currently used in the literature, such as random walks with long-ranged memory kernels or randomly stopped sums where the random time is not concentrated around its expectation. The method reveals the role of the characteristic function when Cram\'er's condition is violated and provides a unified approach within regular variation.</description>

      <title>A Carath\'eodory's Extension Theorem for Families Simpler Than an Algebras of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carath\'eodory's Extension Theorem is a powerful tool that allows us to generate a measure, over a sigma-algebra, from a pre-measure defined over an algebra of sets. However, although this result reduces our work to define a measure by only needing to define a pre-measure, it is not always easy to define the latter. The problem occurs when taking the smallest algebra that contains a family of targeted sets, it can be very complicated to consistently define the value of the pre-measure over its finite union of these sets - a union that is an element of the algebra. Thus, our objective in this article is to reproduce an extension theorem, just like the Carath\'eodory's Extension Theorem, but in the context of probability measures and replacing the need for a probability pre-measure defined over an algebra for now a quasi-measure defined over a refinement. The gain, then, is that the \textit{manual elaboration} of a quasi-measure is simpler than the elaboration of a pre-measure, since a refinement is a simpler structure than an algebra.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic differential equations with time-varying noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic differential equations with time-varying noise of the {\alpha}-H\"older, 0&lt;{\alpha}&lt;1/4,
  dXt =f(t,Xt)dt+g(t)dWt.
  Our study focuses on scenarios where the diffusion coefficient g(t) exhibits temporal variability, starkly contrasting the conventional assumption of a constant diffusion coefficient in the existing literature. This variance brings some complexity to the analysis. Through this investigation, we derive the Onsager-Machlup functional, which acts as the Lagrangian for mapping the most probable transition path between metastable states in stochastic processes affected by time-varying noise. This is done by introducing new measurable norms and applying an appropriate version of the Girsanov transformation. To illustrate our theoretical advancements, we provide numerical simulations, including cases of a one-dimensional SDE and a fast-slow SDE system, which demonstrate the application to multiscale stochastic volatility models, thereby highlighting the significant impact of time-varying diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>A coupling strategy for Brownian motions at fixed time on Carnot groups using Legendre expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new simple  construction of a coupling at a fixed time of two sub-Riemannian Brownian motions on the Heisenberg group and  on the free step 2 Carnot groups. The construction is based on a  Legendre expansion of the standard Brownian motion and of the L{\'e}vy area. We deduce sharp estimates for the decay in total variation distance  between the laws of the Brownian motions. Using a change of probability method, we also obtain the log-Harnack inequality, a Bismut type integration by part formula and reverse Poincar\'e inequalities for the associated semi-group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maglaras, Moallemi, and Zheng (2021) have introduced a flexible queueing model for fragmented limit-order markets, whose fluid limit remains remarkably tractable. In the present study we prove that, in the limit of small and frequent orders, the discrete system indeed converges to the fluid limit, which is characterized by a system of coupled nonlinear ODEs with singular coefficients at the origin. Moreover, we establish that the fluid system is asymptotically stable for an arbitrary number of limit order books in that, over time, it converges to the stationary equilibrium state studied by Maglaras et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Metastability of the contact process on slowly evolving scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contact process on scale-free networks evolving by a stationary dynamics whereby each vertex independently updates its connections with a rate depending on its power. This rate can be slowed down or speeded up by virtue of decreasing or increasing a parameter $\eta$, with $\eta\downarrow-\infty$ approaching the static and $\eta\uparrow\infty$ the mean-field case. We identify the regimes of slow, fast and ultra-fast extinction of the contact process. Slow extinction occurs in the form of metastability, when the contact process maintains a certain density of infected states for a time exponential in the network size. In our main result we identify the metastability exponents, which describe the decay of metastable densities as the infection rate goes to zero, in dependence on $\eta$ and the power-law exponent $\tau$. While the fast evolution cases have been treated in a companion paper, Jacob, Linker, M\"orters (2019), the present paper looks at the significantly more difficult cases of slow network evolution. We describe various effects, like degradation, regeneration and depletion, which lead to a rich picture featuring numerous first-order phase transitions for the metastable exponents. To capture these effects in our upper bounds we develop a new martingale based proof technique combining a local and global analysis of the process.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Approach to Discounted Infinite Horizon and Invariant Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers discounted infinite horizon mean field games by extending the probabilistic weak formulation of the game as introduced by Carmona and Lacker (2015). Under similar assumptions as in the finite horizon game, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for the extended infinite horizon game. The key idea is to construct local versions of the previously considered stable topologies. Further, we analyze how sequences of finite horizon games approximate the infinite horizon one. Under a weakened Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, we can quantify the convergence rate of solutions for the finite horizon games to the one for the infinite horizon game using a novel stability result for mean field games. Lastly, applying our results allows to solve the invariant mean field game as well.</description>

Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <title>Perfect simulation of Markovian load balancing queueing networks in equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a wide class of Markovian load balancing networks of identical single-server infinite-buffer queues. These networks may implement classic parallel server or work stealing load balancing policies, and may be asymmetric, for instance due to topological constraints. The invariant laws are usually not known even up to normalizing constant. We provide three perfect simulation algorithms enabling Monte Carlo estimation of quantities of interest in equilibrium. The state space is infinite, and the algorithms use a dominating process provided by the network with uniform routing, in a coupling preserving a preorder which is related to the increasing convex order. It constitutes an order up to permutation of the coordinates, strictly weaker than the product order. The use of a preorder is novel in this context. The first algorithm is in direct time and uses Palm theory and acceptance rejection. Its duration is finite, a.s., but has infinite expectation. The two other algorithms use dominated coupling from the past; one achieves coalescence by simulating the dominating process into the past until it reaches the empty state, the other, valid for exchangeable policies, is a back-off sandwiching method. Their durations have some exponential moments.</description>

      <title>A uniform-in-time nonlocal approximation of the standard Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which respects the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time -- hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-width asymptotics of random fully connected neural networks with weights drawn from $\alpha$-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed distributions arising as the limiting distributions in the Gnedenko-Kolmogorov heavy-tailed central limit theorem. We show that in an arbitrary bounded Euclidean domain $\mathcal{U}$ with smooth boundary, the random field at the infinite-width limit, characterized in previous literature in terms of finite-dimensional distributions, has sample functions in the fractional Sobolev-Slobodeckij-type quasi-Banach function space $W^{s,p}(\mathcal{U})$ for integrability indices $p &lt; \alpha$ and suitable smoothness indices $s$ depending on the activation function of the neural network, and establish the functional convergence of the processes in $\mathcal{P}(W^{s,p}(\mathcal{U}))$. This convergence result is leveraged in the study of functional posteriors for edge-preserving Bayesian inverse problems with stable neural network priors.</description>

      <title>The second-order Esscher martingale densities for continuous-time market models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the second-order Esscher pricing notion for continuous-time models. Depending whether the stock price $S$ or its logarithm is the main driving noise/shock in the Esscher definition, we obtained two classes of second-order Esscher densities called linear class and exponential class respectively. Using the semimartingale characteristics to parametrize $S$, we characterize the second-order Esscher densities (exponential and linear) using pointwise equations. The role of the second order concept is highlighted in many manners and the relationship between the two classes is singled out for the one-dimensional case. Furthermore, when $S$ is a compound Poisson model, we show how both classes are related to the Delbaen-Haenzendonck's risk-neutral measure. Afterwards, we restrict our model $S$ to follow the jump-diffusion model, for simplicity only, and address the bounds of the stochastic Esscher pricing intervals. In particular, no matter what is the Esscher class, we prove that both bounds (upper and lower) are solutions to the same linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE hereafter for short) but with two different constraints. This shows that BSDEs with constraints appear also in a setting beyond the classical cases of constraints on gain-processes or constraints on portfolios. We prove that our resulting constrained BSDEs have solutions in our framework for a large class of claims' payoffs including any bounded claim, in contrast to the literature, and we single out the monotonic sequence of BSDEs that ``naturally" approximate it as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and interior regularity for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a fractional noise acting as an inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary condition. The model describes a vertical slice of the ocean with a relative motion between the two surfaces and can be thought of as a stochastic variant of the Couette flow. The relative motion of the surfaces is modeled by a Gaussian noise which is coloured in space and fractional in time with Hurst parameter greater than 3/4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of these notes is to give an introduction to the mathematics of quantum noise and some of its applications in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We start with some reminders from the theory of classical stochastic processes. We then provide a brief overview of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, from the viewpoint of quantum probability and adopting the language of Hudson and Parthasarathy. We introduce quantum stochastic processes on a boson Fock space and their calculus. Whenever possible, we make connections with the relevant concepts in classical probability theory. As an application of the theory, we introduce the theory of open quantum systems, with emphasis on the physics and modeling aspects of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale behavior of two-dimensional critical percolation is expected to be described by a conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, this putative percolation CFT is believed to be of the logarithmic type, exhibiting logarithmic corrections to the most commonly encountered and studied behavior of CFT correlations.
  It was recently shown by the first author [Cam24] that critical connection probabilities, when appropriately rescaled, have a well-defined and conformally covariant scaling limit and therefore behave like CFT correlation functions. While constructing a full-fledged percolation CFT is still an open problem, in this paper we prove various CFT features of the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical percolation.
  We identify several connectivity events, including arm-events and the events that a vertex is pivotal or belongs to the percolation backbone, whose probabilities have conformally covariant scaling limits and can be interpreted as CFT correlation functions.
  For some of the probabilities mentioned above, we prove asymptotic expansions that can be interpreted as CFT operator product expansions (OPEs) and provide rigorous versions of CFT fusion rules.
  In some of the probabilities mentioned above, we identify logarithmic singularities, providing the first rigorous confirmation of similar predictions made in the physics literature and establishing the logarithmic nature of the putative percolation CFT.
  The latter result is particularly interesting because, while logarithmic CFTs are more complex and less studied than ordinary CFTs, they have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their role in the analysis of important physical models and phenomena, such as, besides percolation, the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, the quantum Hall effect, disordered critical systems, self-avoiding polymers, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel $Q$-learning algorithm allowing to solve distributionally robust Markov decision problems for which the ambiguity set of probability measures can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it comprises only a finite amount of measures. Therefore, our approach goes beyond the well-studied cases involving ambiguity sets of balls around some reference measure with the distance to reference measure being measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance or the Kullback--Leibler divergence. Hence, our approach allows the applicant to create ambiguity sets better tailored to her needs and to solve the associated robust Markov decision problem via a $Q$-learning algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed by our main result. Moreover, we showcase in several numerical experiments the tractability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion $$\mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t,X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t,X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t),$$ where $A$ is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$, coefficients $f$ and $g$ are Poisson stable in time, and $B^H_Q (t)$ is a $Q$-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index $H$. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions $f$ and $g$ are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as $f$ and $g$. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of the mean-field limit for a moderately interacting particle system in $\R^d$ $(d\geq 2)$. For stochastic initial data, we demonstrate that the solution to the interacting particle model, with an appropriately applied cut-off, converges in probabilistic sense to the solution of the characteristics of the regularized Vlasov models featuring local alignments and Newtonian potential. Notably, the cutoff parameter for the singular potential is selected to scale polynomially with the number of particles, representing an improvement over the logarithmic cut-off obtained in [38].</description>

      <title>Optimal Mixing for Randomly Sampling Edge Colorings on Trees Down to the Max Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the convergence rate of Markov chains for randomly generating an edge coloring of a given tree. Our focus is on the Glauber dynamics which updates the color at a randomly chosen edge in each step. For a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$, when the number of colors $q$ satisfies $q\geq\Delta+2$ then we prove that the Glauber dynamics has an optimal relaxation time of $O(n)$, where the relaxation time is the inverse of the spectral gap. This is optimal in the range of $q$ in terms of $\Delta$ as Dyer, Goldberg, and Jerrum (2006) showed that the relaxation time is $\Omega(n^3)$ when $q=\Delta+1$. For the case $q=\Delta+1$, we show that an alternative Markov chain which updates a pair of neighboring edges has relaxation time $O(n)$. Moreover, for the $\Delta$-regular complete tree we prove $O(n\log^2{n})$ mixing time bounds for the respective Markov chain. Our proofs establish approximate tensorization of variance via a novel inductive approach, where the base case is a tree of height $\ell=O(\Delta^2\log^2{\Delta})$, which we analyze using a canonical paths argument.</description>

      <title>Multiple stage stochastic linear programming with multiple objectives: flexible decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems with random data have a wide range of applications. A typical feature of many such problems is that some variables have to be optimized before certain random coefficients have been realized and for other variables it is sufficient to decide on them afterwards. This leads to a multiple stage decision process. To optimize the variables in the first of two subsequent stages the stochastic problem is transformed into a deterministic program, called the (deterministic equivalent of the) recourse problem. In case of stochastic linear programs with finitely distributed random data this non-stochastic substitute is just a linear program. In the same way a multiple objective linear program is obtained if the original problem has multiple objective functions. In the first of the two stages, a decision maker usually would chose a feasible point out of the set of all Pareto-optimal points. This choice however has consequences to later stage decisions. We claim that the decision process in the earlier of the two stages is not fully transparent if a classical multi-objective decision process is applied: in addition to the original objectives of the problem a decision maker may have a preference for largest possible flexibility in later stage decisions. This additional objective is taken into account if the recourse problem in case of multiple objectives is taken to be a polyhedral convex set optimization problem instead of a multi-objective linear program only. We also discuss several surrogate problems to the recourse problem such as the wait-and-see problem and the expected valued problem for the multi-objective case. The new approach based on set optimization is illustrated by an example, the multi-objective newsvendor problem.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism for a family of cellular automata and duality with the shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will consider a family of cellular automata $\Phi: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N}\circlearrowright$ that are not of algebraic type. Our first goal is to determine conditions that result in the identification of probabilities that are at the same time $\sigma$-invariant and $\Phi$-invariant, where $\sigma$ is the full shift. Via the use of versions of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$ we will show that there is an abundant set of measures with this property; they will be equilibrium probabilities for different Lispchitz potentials $A,B$ and for the corresponding dynamics $\sigma$ and $\Phi$. Via the use of a version of the involution kernel $W$ for a $(\sigma,\Phi)$-mixed skew product $\hat{\Phi}: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$, given $A$ one can determine $B$, in such way that the integral kernel $e^W$ produce a duality between eigenprobabilities $\rho_A$ for $(\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma})^*$ and eigenfunctions $\psi_B$ for $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$. In another direction, considering the non-mixed extension $\hat{\Phi}_n : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$ of $\Phi$, given a Lispchitz potential $\hat{A} : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R}$, we can identify a Lipschitz potential $A:\{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} $, in such away that relates the variational problem of $\hat{\Phi}_n$-Topological Pressure for $\hat{A}$ with the $\Phi$-Topological Pressure for $A$. We also present a version of Livsic's Theorem. Whether or not $\Phi$ (or $\hat{\Phi})$ can eventually be conjugated with another shift of finite type is irrelevant in our context.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing via Coupling Independence for Spin Systems with Unbounded Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to prove the mixing or relaxation time for the Glauber dynamics on spin systems with unbounded degree. It works for general spin systems including both $2$-spin and multi-spin systems. As applications for this approach:
  $\bullet$ We prove the optimal $O(n)$ relaxation time for the Glauber dynamics of random $q$-list-coloring on an $n$-vertices triangle-tree graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ such that $q/\Delta &gt; \alpha^\star$, where $\alpha^\star \approx 1.763$ is the unique positive solution of the equation $\alpha = \exp(1/\alpha)$. This improves the $n^{1+o(1)}$ relaxation time for Glauber dynamics obtained by the previous work of Jain, Pham, and Vuong (2022). Besides, our framework can also give a near-linear time sampling algorithm under the same condition.
  $\bullet$ We prove the optimal $O(n)$ relaxation time and near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the Glauber dynamics on hardcore models with parameter $\lambda$ in $\textit{balanced}$ bipartite graphs such that $\lambda &lt; \lambda_c(\Delta_L)$ for the max degree $\Delta_L$ in left part and the max degree $\Delta_R$ of right part satisfies $\Delta_R = O(\Delta_L)$. This improves the previous result by Chen, Liu, and Yin (2023).
  At the heart of our proof is the notion of $\textit{coupling independence}$ which allows us to consider multiple vertices as a huge single vertex with exponentially large domain and do a "coarse-grained" local-to-global argument on spin systems. The technique works for general (multi) spin systems and helps us obtain some new comparison results for Glauber dynamics.</description>

This proof generalizes already known proofs for the classical contact process or some of its variants and allows us to obtain conjectured asymptotic shape theorems for several models: the contact process in a randomly evolving environment, the oriented percolation with hostile immigration, the bounded modified contact process, Richardson's model with stirring and the contact process with stirring</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discovers a novel link between probability theory (of stable random fields) and von Neumann algebras. It is established that the group measure space construction corresponding to a minimal representation is an invariant of a stationary symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random field indexed by any countable group $G$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$, we characterize ergodicity (and also absolute non-ergodicity) of stationary S$\alpha$S fields in terms of the central decomposition of this crossed product von Neumann algebra coming from any (not necessarily minimal) Rosinski representation. This shows that ergodicity (or the complete absence of it) is a $W^\ast$-rigid property (in a suitable sense) for this class of fields. All our results have analogues for stationary max-stable random fields as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Feller diffusion (Zs, s $\ge$ 0) (with diffusion coefficient $\sqrt$ 2$\beta$ and drift $\theta$ $\in$ R) that we condition on {Zt = at}, where at is a deterministic function, and we study the limit in distribution of the conditioned process and of its genealogical tree as t $\rightarrow$ +$\infty$. When at does not increase too rapidly, we recover the standard size-biased process (and the associated genealogical tree given by the Kesten's tree). When at behaves as $\alpha$$\beta$ 2 t 2 when $\theta$ = 0 or as $\alpha$ e 2$\beta$|$\theta$|t when $\theta$ = 0, we obtain a new process whose distribution is described by a Girsanov transformation and equivalently by a SDE with a Poissonian immigration. Its associated genealogical tree is described by an infinite discrete skeleton (which does not satisfy the branching property) decorated with Brownian continuum random trees given by a Poisson point measure. As a by-product of this study, we introduce several sets of trees endowed with a Gromovtype distance which are of independent interest and which allow here to define in a formal and measurable way the decoration of a backbone with a family of continuum random trees.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by allocation strategies in multi-armed bandit model, we propose a pathwise construction of Walsh diffusions. For any infinitesimal generator on a star shaped graph, there exists a unique time change associated with a multi-parameter process such that the time change of this multi-parameter process is the desired diffusion. The time change has an interpretation of time allocation of the process on each edge, and it can be derived explicitly from a family of equations.</description>

Abstract: Given finite i.i.d.~samples in a Hilbert space with zero mean and trace-class covariance operator $\Sigma$, the problem of recovering the spectral projectors of $\Sigma$ naturally arises in many applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding distributional approximations of the spectral projectors of the empirical covariance operator $\hat \Sigma$, and offer a dimension-free framework where the complexity is characterized by the so-called relative rank of $\Sigma$. In this setting, novel quantitative limit theorems and bootstrap approximations are presented subject only to mild conditions in terms of moments and spectral decay. In many cases, these even improve upon existing results in a Gaussian setting.</description>

The associated optimal stopping boundary is proved to be Lipschitz continuous on any closed interval that excludes the horizon, and it is characterized by the unique solution of an integral equation. A Picard iteration algorithm is discussed and implemented to exemplify the numerical computation and geometry of the optimal stopping boundary for some illustrative cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a large class of spatially-embedded random graphs that includes among others long-range percolation, continuum scale-free percolation and the age-dependent random connection model. We assume that the model is supercritical: there is an infinite component. We identify the stretch-exponent $\zeta\in(0,1)$ of the decay of the cluster-size distribution. That is, with $|\mathcal{C}(0)|$ denoting the number of vertices in the component of the vertex at $0\in \mathbb{R}^d$, we prove \[
  \mathbb{P}(k&lt; |\mathcal{C}(0)|&lt;\infty)=\exp\big(-\Theta(k^{\zeta})\big), \qquad \text{as }k\to\infty.
  \] The value of $\zeta$ undergoes several phase transitions with respect to three main model parameters: the Euclidean dimension $d$, the power-law tail exponent $\tau$ of the degree distribution and a long-range parameter $\alpha$ governing the presence of long edges in Euclidean space. In this paper we present the proof for the region in the phase diagram where the model is a generalization of continuum scale-free percolation and/or hyperbolic random graphs: $\zeta$ in this regime depends both on $\tau,\alpha$. We also prove that the second-largest component in a box of volume $n$ is of size $\Theta((\log n)^{1/\zeta})$ with high probability. We develop a deterministic algorithm, the cover expansion, as new methodology. This algorithm enables us to prevent too large components that may be de-localized or locally dense in space.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the Gibbs measure of an interacting particle system with a general interaction kernel at various temperature regimes. We are particularly interested in fine features of the convergence to the mean-field density as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main results are concentration bounds, and estimates on the Laplace transform of fluctuations. The main technique is a regularization procedure for general interaction kernels, based on an associated parabolic flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Markov processes on the square lattice has been given recently by the second author a new algebraic description in terms of operads. In particular, this new approach allows for a nice description of invariant boundary conditions and infinite-volume Gibbs measures. This theory comes with new algebraic objects which have not been constructed on any non trivial model yet. In this article, the main objective is to exhibit and understand these structures in the particular case of Gaussian Markov fields on the two-dimensional square lattice. This article, in the Gaussian framework, is the first time where all the operadic constructions -- products and eigen-elements up to morphisms -- introduced by the second author are defined rigorously. We also relate these constructions to more classical approach such as the transfer matrix of statistical mechanics and the Fourier transform. The description of half-strips and corners is new and requires the introduction of new operations such as folding. From the probabilistic point of view, we also show that the operadic products on the boundaries are not easily defined and most operations are lifted to the level of parameter spaces, here quadratic forms through Schur complements.</description>

      <title>Universality in Random Persistent Homology and Scale-Invariant Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a universality result for the limiting distribution of persistence diagrams arising from geometric filtrations over random point processes. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the ratio of persistence values (death/birth), and show that for fixed dimension, homological degree and filtration type (Cech or Vietoris-Rips), the limiting distribution is independent of the underlying point process distribution, i.e., universal. In proving this result, we present a novel general framework for universality in scale-invariant functionals on point processes. Finally, we also provide a number of new results related to Morse theory in random geometric complexes, which may be of an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rates of Convergence of the Magnetization in the Tensor Curie-Weiss Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive distributional convergence rates for the magnetization vector and the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator of the inverse temperature parameter in the tensor Curie-Weiss Potts model. Limit theorems for the magnetization vector have been derived recently in Bhowal and Mukherjee (2023), where several phase transition phenomena in terms of the scaling of the (centered) magnetization and its asymptotic distribution were established, depending upon the position of the true parameters in the parameter space. In the current work, we establish Berry-Esseen type results for the magnetization vector, specifying its rate of convergence at these different phases. At most points in the parameter space, this rate is $N^{-1/2}$ ($N$ being the size of the Curie-Weiss network), while at some "special" points, the rate is either $N^{-1/4}$ or $N^{-1/6}$, depending upon the behavior of the fourth derivative of a certain "negative free energy function" at these special points. These results are then used to derive Berry-Esseen type bounds for the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator of the inverse temperature parameter whenever it lies above a certain criticality threshold.</description>

      <title>From clonal interference to Poissonian interacting trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population whose size $N$ is fixed over the generations, and in which random beneficial mutations arrive at a rate of order $1/\log N$ per generation. In this so-called Gerrish-Lenski regime, typically a finite number of contending mutations is present together with one resident type. These mutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference. We study a system of Poissonian interacting trajectories (PIT) which arise as a large population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending clonal subpopulations. We prove that this system exhibits an a.s.\ positive asymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to be finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We relate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we derive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident population in the PIT. A main result of this work is that the Poissonian interacting trajectories arise as a large-population limit of a continuous time Moran model with strong selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the topic of cost-efficiency in incomplete markets. A payoff is called cost-efficient if it achieves a given probability distribution at some given investment horizon with a minimum initial budget. Extensive literature exists for the case of a complete financial market. We show how the problem can be extended to incomplete markets and how the main results from the theory of complete markets still hold in adapted form. In particular, we find that in incomplete markets, the optimal portfolio choice for non-decreasing preferences that are diversification-loving (a notion introduced in this paper) must be "perfectly" cost-efficient. This notion of perfect cost-efficiency is shown to be equivalent to the fact that the payoff can be rationalized, i.e., it is the solution to an expected utility problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tempered stable distributions are frequently used in financial applications (e.g., for option pricing) in which the tails of stable distributions would be too heavy. Given the non-explicit form of the probability density function, estimation relies on numerical algorithms which typically are time-consuming. We compare several parametric estimation methods such as the maximum likelihood method and different generalized method of moment approaches. We study large sample properties and derive consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic efficiency results for our estimators. Additionally, we conduct simulation studies to analyze finite sample properties measured by the empirical bias, precision, and asymptotic confidence interval coverage rates and compare computational costs. We cover relevant subclasses of tempered stable distributions such as the classical tempered stable distribution and the tempered stable subordinator. Moreover, we discuss the normal tempered stable distribution which arises by subordinating a Brownian motion with a tempered stable subordinator. Our financial applications to log returns of asset indices and to energy spot prices illustrate the benefits of tempered stable models.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport and Wasserstein distances for causal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variant of optimal transport adapted to the causal structure given by an underlying directed graph $G$. Different graph structures lead to different specifications of the optimal transport problem. For instance, a fully connected graph yields standard optimal transport, a linear graph structure corresponds to causal optimal transport between the distributions of two discrete-time stochastic processes, and an empty graph leads to a notion of optimal transport related to CO-OT, Gromov-Wasserstein distances and factored OT. We derive different characterizations of $G$-causal transport plans and introduce Wasserstein distances between causal models that respect the underlying graph structure. We show that average treatment effects are continuous with respect to $G$-causal Wasserstein distances and small perturbations of structural causal models lead to small deviations in $G$-causal Wasserstein distance. We also introduce an interpolation between causal models based on $G$-causal Wasserstein distance and compare it to standard Wasserstein interpolation.</description>

      <title>Error-induced extinction in a multi-type critical birth-death process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mutation rates in microbes and cancer cells can result in error-induced extinction (EEX), where every descendant cell eventually acquires a lethal mutation. In this work, we investigate critical birth-death processes with $n$ distinct types as a birth-death model of EEX in a growing population. Each type-$i$ cell divides independently $(i)\to(i)+(i)$ or mutates $(i)\to(i+1)$ at the same rate. The total number of cells grows exponentially as a Yule process until a cell of type-$n$ appears, which cell type can only die at rate one. This makes the whole process critical and hence after the exponentially growing phase eventually all cells die with probability one. We present large-time asymptotic results for the general $n$-type critical birth-death process. We find that the mass function of the number of cells of type-$k$ has algebraic and stationary tail $(\text{size})^{-1-\chi_k}$, with $\chi_k=2^{1-k}$, for $k=2,\dots,n$, in sharp contrast to the exponential tail of the first type. The same exponents describe the tail of the asymptotic survival probability $(\text{time})^{-\chi_n}$. We present applications of the results for studying extinction due to intolerable mutation rates in biological populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model for general cyclical long memory is introduced, by means of random modulation of certain bivariate long memory time series. This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</description>

      <title>Strongly Tail-Optimal Scheduling in the Light-Tailed M/G/1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling jobs in a queueing system, specifically an M/G/1 with light-tailed job sizes, to asymptotically optimize the response time tail. This means scheduling to make $\mathbf{P}[T &gt; t]$, the chance a job's response time exceeds $t$, decay as quickly as possible in the $t \to \infty$ limit. For some time, the best known policy was First-Come First-Served (FCFS), which has an asymptotically exponential tail: $\mathbf{P}[T &gt; t] \sim C e^{-\gamma t}$. FCFS achieves the optimal *decay rate* $\gamma$, but its *tail constant* $C$ is suboptimal. Only recently have policies that improve upon FCFS's tail constant been discovered. But it is unknown what the optimal tail constant is, let alone what policy might achieve it.
  In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal tail constant $C$, and we introduce *$\gamma$-Boost*, a new policy that achieves this optimal tail constant. Roughly speaking, $\gamma$-Boost operates similarly to FCFS, but it pretends that small jobs arrive earlier than their true arrival times. This significantly reduces the response time of small jobs without unduly delaying large jobs, improving upon FCFS's tail constant by up to 50% with only moderate job size variability, with even larger improvements for higher variability. While these results are for systems with full job size information, we also introduce and analyze a version of $\gamma$-Boost that works in settings with partial job size information, showing it too achieves significant gains over FCFS. Finally, we show via simulation that $\gamma$-Boost has excellent practical performance.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures. Relating this convolution to the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians and using recent results describing the structure constants of the latter, we give a manifestly positive formula for the density of the probability distribution for the product of generic conjugacy classes. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive and explicit formula for the volume of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \ll 1, $$ where the implied constant is absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a conjecture of Arratia (2002) arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the left-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$. We also use this coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>
