      <title>Real-Time Scene Reconstruction using Light Field Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene (captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale, implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Geometric and Textural Consistency 3D Scene Generation via Single Image-guided Model Generation and Layout Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis.</description>

      <title>Time Series Information Visualization -- A Review of Approaches and Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Model Simplification through refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As modeling and visualization applications proliferate, there arises a need to simplify large polygonal models at interactive rates. Unfortunately existing polygon mesh simplification algorithms are not well suited for this task because they are either too slow (requiring the simplified model to be pre-computed) or produce models that are too poor in quality. These shortcomings become particularly acute when models are extremely large. We present an algorithm suitable for simplification of large models at interactive speeds. The algorithm is fast and can guarantee displayable results within a given time limit. Results also have good quality. Inspired by splitting algorithms from vector quantization literature, we simplify models in reverse, beginning with an extremely coarse approximation and refining it. Approximations of surface curvature guide the simplification process. Previously produced simplifications can be further refined by using them as input to the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Blended Point Cloud Diffusion for Localized Text-guided Shape Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original shape and also adherence to the textual description.</description>

      <title>ObjectGS: Object-aware Scene Reconstruction and Scene Understanding via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding. Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks, but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.

      <title>Gaussian Splatting with Discretized SDF for Relightable Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.</description>

      <title>GALE: Leveraging Heterogeneous Systems for Efficient Unstructured Mesh Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured meshes present challenges in scientific data analysis due to irregular distribution and complex connectivity. Computing and storing connectivity information is a major bottleneck for visualization algorithms, affecting both time and memory performance. Recent task-parallel data structures address this by precomputing connectivity information at runtime while the analysis algorithm executes, effectively hiding computation costs and improving performance. However, existing approaches are CPU-bound, forcing the data structure and analysis algorithm to compete for the same computational resources, limiting potential speedups. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel task-parallel approach optimized for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. Specifically, we offload the computation of mesh connectivity information to GPU threads, enabling CPU threads to focus on executing the visualization algorithm. Following this paradigm, we propose GALE (GPU-Aided Localized data structurE), the first open-source CUDA-based data structure designed for heterogeneous task parallelism. Experiments on two 20-core CPUs and an NVIDIA V100 GPU show that GALE achieves up to 2.7x speedup over state-of-the-art localized data structures while maintaining memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>In-2-4D: Inbetweening from Two Single-View Images to 4D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images capturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user study, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

      <title>Controllable Weather Synthesis and Removal with Video Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Wavelet Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction, which effectively balances rendering quality, efficiency, and speed. However, existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>FlexiClip: Locality-Preserving Free-Form Character Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animating clipart images with seamless motion while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal coherence presents significant challenges. Existing methods, such as AniClipart, effectively model spatial deformations but often fail to ensure smooth temporal transitions, resulting in artifacts like abrupt motions and geometric distortions. Similarly, text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models struggle to handle clipart due to the mismatch in statistical properties between natural video and clipart styles. This paper introduces FlexiClip, a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by addressing the intertwined challenges of temporal consistency and geometric integrity. FlexiClip extends traditional B\'ezier curve-based trajectory modeling with key innovations: temporal Jacobians to correct motion dynamics incrementally, continuous-time modeling via probability flow ODEs (pfODEs) to mitigate temporal noise, and a flow matching loss inspired by GFlowNet principles to optimize smooth motion transitions. These enhancements ensure coherent animations across complex scenarios involving rapid movements and non-rigid deformations. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FlexiClip in generating animations that are not only smooth and natural but also structurally consistent across diverse clipart types, including humans and animals. By integrating spatial and temporal modeling with pre-trained video diffusion models, FlexiClip sets a new standard for high-quality clipart animation, offering robust performance across a wide range of visual content.
