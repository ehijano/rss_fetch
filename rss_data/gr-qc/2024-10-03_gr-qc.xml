      <title>Cosmological constraints on $f(Q)$ gravity models in the non-coincident formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article investigates cosmological applications of $f(Q)$ theories in a non-coincident formalism. We explore a new $f(Q)$ theory dynamics utilizing a non-vanishing affine connection involving a non-constant function $\gamma(t)=-a^{-1}\dot{H}$, resulting in Friedmann equations that are entirely distinct from those of $f(T)$ theory. In addition, we propose a new parameterization of the Hubble function that can consistently depicts the present deceleration parameter value, transition redshift, and the late time de-Sitter limit. We evaluate the predictions of the assumed Hubble function by imposing constraints on the free parameters utilizing Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by employing the CC, Pantheon+SH0ES, and the BAO samples. Moreover, we conduct the AIC and BIC statistical evaluations to determine the reliability of MCMC analysis. Further, we consider some well-known corrections to the STEGR case such as an exponentital $f(Q)$ correction, logarithmic $f(Q)$ correction, and a power-law $f(Q)$ correction and then we find the constraints on the parameters of these models via energy conditions. Finally, to test the physical plausibility of the assumed $f(Q)$ models we conduct the thermodynamical stability analysis via the sound speed parameter.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spherical Solutions in Rastall Gravity by Gravitational Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Finch-Skea isotropic ansatz representing a self-gravitating interior to two anisotropic spherical solutions within the context of Rastall gravity. For this purpose, we use a newly developed technique, named as gravitational decoupling approach through the minimal geometric deformation. The junction conditions that provide the governing rules for the smooth matching of the interior and exterior geometries at the hypersurface are formulated with the outer geometry depicted by the Schwarzschild spacetime. We check the physical viability of both solutions through energy conditions for two fixed values of the Rastall parameter. The behavior of the equation of state parameters, surface redshift and compactness function are also investigated. Finally, we study the stability of the resulting solutions through Herrera cracking approach and the causality condition. It is concluded that the chosen parametric values provide stable structure only for the solution corresponding to the pressure-like constraint.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>Worldline EFT treatment of quadratic and cubic gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores modifications to General Relativity (GR) by considering higher-order curvature terms in the gravitational action, specifically focusing on the quadratic Ricci scalar and a particular cubic contraction of the Riemann tensor. These modifications introduce new interactions at short distances, potentially altering the dynamics of compact objects. We calculate the effective two-body binding potential energy for these modified theories to quantify these effects using the worldline effective field theory (WEFT) formalism. This approach allows us to systematically integrate out short-distance gravitational effects, capturing the modifications to the binding potential. Our results demonstrate how the quadratic Ricci scalar and cubic Riemann tensor terms contribute to the two-body interaction at the leading order, highlighting deviations from classical GR predictions. These findings provide insight into the possible observational signatures of such modified gravity theories in binary systems and other astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting asteroid-mass primordial black holes in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the existence of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) remains almost completely unconstrained and thus could still comprise the totality of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we show that standard searches for continuous gravitational waves -- long-lived, quasi-monochromatic signals -- could detect extreme mass-ratio inspirals of asteroid-mass PBHs in orbit around a stellar-mass companion using future gravitational-wave (GW) data from Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO). We evaluate the robustness of our projected constraints against the eccentricity of the binary, the choice of the mass of the primary object, and the GW frequency range that we analyze. Furthermore, to determine whether there could be ways to detect asteroid-mass PBHs using current GW data, we quantify the impact of changes in current techniques on the sensitivity towards asteroid-mass PBHs. We show that methods that allow for signals with increased and more complicated frequency drifts over time could obtain much more stringent constraints now than those derived from standard techniques, though at slightly larger computational cost, potentially constraining the fraction of DM that certain asteroid-mass PBHs could compose to be less than one with current detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity with the most general Lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion, focusing on the possible interaction of the axial torsion with the electromagnetic field. From the analysis of the closed system of field equations, we identify the magnetic helicity density and the spin density of the electromagnetic field as the components of the source for the torsion field. We consider the propagation of a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave and demonstrate the ``dichroism'' or the polarization rotation effect under the action of external electric and magnetic fields orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering in Lorentz-violating gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes in Lorentz violating gravity enjoy a double horizon structure which resembles that of the Kerr solution in General Relativity. Moreover, when a scalar field with a modified dispersion relation is coupled to these backgrounds, an on-shell mode with negative energy becomes possible in the region in between the horizons. Both properties together call for the possibility of extracting energy from the black hole by scattering of waves, even if the space-time is stationary. Here, we perform such scattering explicitly in the frequency domain, showing that indeed, a superradiant effect, leading to energy extraction, can be observed for modes with $l&gt;0$ in spherical symmetry. In particular, we show that the mode $l=1$ can display a reflectivity exceeding 700% for certain values of the Lorentz violating scale. This leads us to conjecture the instability of these space-times against such perturbations, although astrophysical size objects should have long life-times. Our results are not unique to Lorentz violating gravity and can be extended to any setting where modified dispersion relations are present, such as analogue gravity.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Corrections to Gravitational Potentials in the On-Shell Renormalization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections induced by a non-minimally coupled massive scalar to the two gravitational potentials sourced by a static point mass in Minkowski space via solving the effective Einstein field equations. We first obtain a manifestly transverse graviton self-energy and, by performing resummation of the bubble diagrams, derive the associated dressed graviton propagator in the general covariant gauge. For one class of gauges, which include the Landau gauge, the dressed graviton propagator becomes proportional to the tree-level propagator in the on-shell limit. This fact allows us to employ the on-shell renormalization scheme so that the renormalized Newton constant $G$ takes the value measured in the experiments. The resulting corrections to the gravitational potentials share similar structures with the vacuum polarization correction to the Coulomb potential regarding their analytic expressions and long distance behavior. By comparing our results with gravitational slip measurements, we establish a constraint on the non-minimal coupling: $|\xi| \lesssim 5\times 10^{43}/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.</description>

      <title>The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Spacetime emergence: an (in)effective story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physicists and philosophers are increasingly prone to regarding our current physical theories as providing 'effective descriptions' of real-world systems. In the context of quantum gravity research, this fuels a common view that the classical spacetime theory of general relativity provides effective descriptions where it is successfully applied. That common view of general relativity, in turn, encourages an 'effective' understanding of spacetime emergence. But descriptions of spacetime in general relativity irreducibly include global physical content, which is not effective. Recognizing this fact reigns in the interpretive scope of the common view of general relativity and specifically undermines our thinking about spacetime emergence effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a review of James Read's insightful book, Background Independence in Classical and Quantum Gravity. The book introduces various notions of background-independence which it then makes precise, and uses to make verdicts about background-independence on a wide range of examples of spacetime theories in both classical and quantum gravity. This short book is, in several ways, a worthy example of how technical philosophy of physics ought to be done. I first discuss the content, then raise a number points where I disagree with the book.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the polarization of black hole jets on scales of $10-10^3\,GM/c^2$ and show that large spatial swings in the polarization occur at three characteristic distances from the black hole: the radius where the counter-jet dims, the radius where the magnetic field becomes azimuthally dominated (the light cylinder), and the radius where the plasma reaches its terminal Lorentz factor. To demonstrate the existence of these swings, we derive a correspondence between axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic outflows and their force-free limits, which allows us to analytically compute the plasma kinematics and magnetic field structure of collimated, general relativistic jets. We then use this method to ray trace polarized images of black hole jets with a wide range of physical parameters, focusing on roughly face-on jets like that of M87. We show that the location of the polarization swings is strongly tied to the location of the light cylinder and thus to the black hole's spin, illustrating a new method of measuring spin from polarized images of the jet. This signature of black hole spin should be observable by future interferometric arrays like the (Next Generation) Event Horizon Telescope, which will be able to resolve the polarized emission of the jet down to the near-horizon region at high dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Regge-Teitelboim cosmology driven by a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the dynamic equations governing a Regge Teitelboim (RT) brane that represents our universe considering that its degrees of freedom are the embedding functions, evolving in a five dimensional curved spacetime. Within this framework, we investigate the effects of embedding a Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) metric into a specific curved ambient spacetime. This approach allows us to analyze in detail how the ambient spacetime's curvature influences the brane universe's dynamics. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the Hubble parameter $H$ and the redshift $z$, demonstrating that our results significantly agree with actual observational data. This is contrasted and compared with other approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a natural analogue of the Yang-Mills equations using the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket between vector-valued differential forms. The gauge field is a rank-two tensor, and when one constrains it to be symmetric, then the system exhibits fractonic behaviours. In the linearised limit, the constrained equations of motion reduce to those of the covariant fracton model [Bertolini-Maggiore 2022].</description>

      <title>An eccentric transit timing test of modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MOND modified gravity paradigm, best known for its agreement with galactic rotation curve data, is difficult to devise laboratory tests for. MOND's predictions differ substantially from Newtonian gravity only in the case of very small accelerations ($a &lt; a_0 = 1.2\times10^{-10}~\mathrm{m/s}^2 = 3.8~\mathrm{mm/s/y}$). In the solar system, radio and laser measurements of test bodies do permit acceleration measurements this precise; however, in at least some viable realizations, MOND has an "external field effect" (EFE) which essentially disables the MOND effects in the presence of the inner Milky Way's background gravitational field, invalidating Solar System limits. Can we do any measurement with Solar-System-like acceleration precision, but on a system many kiloparsecs away that avoids the EFE? In this paper, we show that MOND's non-$1/r^2$ gravitational acceleration has a unique and hard-to-fake effect: in contrast to the non-precessing elliptical orbits predicted by two-body Newtonian gravity, in the presence of MOND we expect apsidal precession in two-body systems. An extreme precision apsidal precession detection opportunity is available for eclipsing binaries, where, for some viewing geometries, apsidal precession causes transit time variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). If appropriate binaries can be found and measured, the presence or absence of timing variations may provide a definitive "solar-system-like" test of many EFE-bearing MOND theories like QUMOND.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Wald formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar clouds and black hole spacetimes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study static black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with a massive scalar field as an example of higher curvature gravity. The scalar mass introduces an additional scale and leads to a strong suppression of the scalar field beyond its Compton wavelength. We numerically compute sGB black hole spacetimes and scalar configurations and also compare with perturbative results for small couplings, where we focus on a dilatonic coupling function. We analyze the constraints on the parameters from requiring the curvature singularity to be located inside the black hole horizon $r_h$ and the relation to the regularity condition for the scalar field. For scalar field masses $m r_h \gtrsim 10^{-1}$, this leads to a new and currently most stringent bound on sGB coupling constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha/r_h^2 \sim 10^{-1}$ in the context of stellar mass black holes. Lastly, we look at several properties of the black hole configurations relevant for further work on observational consequences, including the scalar monopole charge, Arnowitt Deser Misner mass, curvature invariants and the frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring.</description>

Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear response of four dimensional magnetized black holes and regular topological stars arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions. We consider both radial and nonradial perturbations and study the stability of these solutions, both in the frequency and in the time domain. Due to the presence of magnetic fluxes in the background, axial (i.e., odd-parity) gravitational perturbations are coupled to polar (i.e., even-parity) electromagnetic perturbations (Type-I sector) whereas polar gravitational and scalar perturbations are coupled to axial electromagnetic ones (Type-II sector). We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of the radial perturbations and of the Type I sector, finding no evidence of linear instabilities (besides the already known Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings occurring only in a certain range of the parameters), even despite the fact that the effective potential for radial perturbations of topological stars is negative and divergent near the inner boundary. Ultracompact topological stars exhibit long-lived trapped modes that give rise to echoes in the time-domain response. Their prompt response is very similar to that of the corresponding black hole with comparable charge-to-mass ratio. This provides a concrete realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory. The numerical analysis of the Type-II sector will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly in Metric-Affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the trace (Weyl) anomaly within a general metric-affine geometry that includes both torsion and nonmetricity. Using the Heat Kernel method and Seeley's algorithm, we compute the Minakshisundaram coefficients for arbitrary spacetimes within this framework, incorporating the effects of the nonmetricity and torsion tensors for the first time. We then determine the corrections to the trace anomaly at one loop for the matter sector in theories invariant under conformal transformation, frame rescaling transformation, and projective transformation. We identify a new anomaly related to hypermomentum, arising from the dilation part mediated by the Weyl component of nonmetricity. As particular cases, we analyze the spin $0$ and spin $1/2$ cases, considering various couplings between matter and the gravitational sector. We demonstrate that invariance under the frame rescaling transformation results in an anomaly in the relationship between the hypermomentum and the stress-energy tensor. In contrast, under the projective transformation, no anomaly is present; specifically, there is no non-zero trace of the hypermomentum tensor in any of our concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.0128 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing black holes with and without spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories via optical features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory admits both vacuum-general relativity (GR) and scalarized hairy black holes as valid solutions, which provides a distinctive signature of new physics in strong gravity regime. In this paper, we shall examine the optical features of Gauss-Bonnet black holes with spontaneous scalarization, which is governed by the coupling parameter $\lambda$. We find that the photon sphere, critical impact parameter and innermost stable circular orbit all decrease as the increasing of $\lambda$. Using observable data from Event Horizon Telescope, we establish the upper limit for $\lambda$. Then we construct the optical appearances of the scalarized black holes illuminated by various thin accretions. Our findings reveal that the scalarized black holes consistently exhibit smaller shadow sizes and reduced brightness compared to Schwarzschild black holes. Notably, in the case of thin spherical accretion, the shadow of the scalarized black hole is smaller, but the surrounding bright ring is more pronounced. Our results highlight the observable features of the scalarized black holes, providing a distinguishable probe from their counterpart in GR in strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Shadows of Black Holes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two $f(R,T)$ gravity models and derive black hole solutions within these models. We focus on investigating how the $f(R,T)$ model influences the thermodynamic characteristics of black holes by studying their thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry. We consider five specific values of the thermodynamic parameter $\omega$, which signify five different classes of black hole solutions in general relativity (GR). We observe significant changes in the local topological properties of these black holes compared to GR, depending on the model parameters. Notably, we identify an additional topological class $W=0$ for some values of $\omega$ that is absent in the GR framework. We also study the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole using the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that the singular point, where the GTD scalar curvature diverges, corresponds exactly to the point where the heat capacity changes sign. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters of both models considered by utilizing black hole shadow data from the Sgr A* black hole, measured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-dependent behaviour of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstates and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstates, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behaviour, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviour by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behaviour of OTOC in presence of the given quench profile.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter explanation of NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10148</link>

Abstract: The angular correlation of pulsar residuals observed by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations show evidence in support of the Hellings-Downs correlation expected from stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this paper, we offer a non-gravitational wave explanation of the observed pulsar timing correlations as caused by an ultra-light $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ gauge boson dark matter (ULDM). ULDM can affect the pulsar correlations in two ways. The gravitational potential of vector ULDM gives rise to a Shapiro time delay of the pulsar signals and a non-trivial angular correlation (as compared to the scalar ULDM case). In addition, if the pulsars have a non-zero charge of the dark matter gauge group, then the electric field of the local dark matter causes an oscillation of the pulsar and a corresponding Doppler shift of the pulsar signal. We point out that pulsars carry a significant charge of muons, and thus the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ vector dark matter contributes to both the Doppler oscillations and the time delay of the pulsar signals. The synergy between these two effects provides a better fit to the shape of the angular correlation function, as observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, compared to the standard SGWB explanation or the SGWB combined with time delay explanations. Our analysis shows that in addition to the SGWB signal, there may potentially be excess timing residuals attributable to the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ ULDM.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon Curvature Perturbations Are Protected against One-Loop Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine one-loop corrections from small-scale curvature perturbations to the superhorizon-limit ones in single-field inflation models, which have recently caused controversy. We consider the case where the Universe experiences transitions of slow-roll (SR) $\to$ intermediate period $\to$ SR. The intermediate period can be an ultra-slow-roll period or a resonant amplification period, either of which enhances small-scale curvature perturbations. We assume that the superhorizon curvature perturbations are conserved at least during each of the SR periods. Within this framework, we show that the superhorizon curvature perturbations during the first and the second SR periods coincide at one-loop level in the slow-roll limit.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Approaches to photon absorption in a Lorentz invariance violation scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very high-energy astrophysical gamma rays suffer a suppression of their flux along their propagation due to their interaction, through the $\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-$ pair-production process, with the soft photon backgrounds present in the Universe. We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>Electric/magnetic duality of dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the (anti-)self-duality conditions under which the electric and magnetic parts of the conserved charges of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS solution become equivalent. Within a holographic framework, the stress tensor and the boundary Cotton tensor are computed from the electric/magnetic content of the Weyl tensor. The holographic stress tensor/Cotton tensor duality is recovered along the (anti-)self-dual curve in parameter space. We show that the latter not only implies a duality relation for the mass but also for the angular momentum. The partition function is computed to first order in the saddle-point approximation and a BPS bound is obtained. The ground state of the theory is enlarged to all the (anti-)self-dual configurations when the $SO(4)$ and $U(1)$ Pontryagin densities are introduced. We demonstrate this at the level of the action and variations thereof.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction and Gauge Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of gravitational collapse in the accreting neutron stars of binary-driven hypernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, $t_{\rm col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_{\rm col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS-BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.</description>

      <title>The no boundary density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a no-boundary proposal for a subregion of the universe. In the classical approximation, this density matrix involves finding a specific classical solution of the equations of motion with no boundary. Beyond the usual no boundary condition at early times, we also have another no boundary condition in the region we trace out. We can find the prescription by starting from the usual Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wavefunction on a full slice and tracing out the unobserved region in the classical approximation. We discuss some specific subregions and compute the corresponding solutions. These geometries lead to phenomenologically unacceptable probabilities, as expected.
  We also discuss how the usual Coleman de Luccia bubble solutions can be interpreted as a possible no boundary contribution to the density matrix of the universe. These geometries lead to local (but not global) maxima of the probability that are phenomenologically acceptable.</description>
