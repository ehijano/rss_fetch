      <title>Estimate collective cooperativeness of driving agents in mixed traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many natural, social, and engineered systems that contain multiple agents. Characterizing and quantifying cooperativeness of driving agents is of interest and significance for two reasons. Theoretically, it will enhance the understanding of micro-macro connections and emergence of cooperation in mixed traffic. Pragmatically, this understanding will benefit the design and operations of automated and mixed-autonomy transportation systems. However, it remains unclear how the cooperativeness can be accurately defined and quantified from empirical data, and it remains open when and to what extent collective cooperativeness exists. This paper is intended to fill the gap. We propose a unified conceptual framework to estimate collective cooperativeness of driving agents leveraging a recent behavioral equilibrium model of mixed autonomy traffic (Li et al. 2022a). This framework is interpretable, theoretically consistent, and enables quantifying collective cooperativeness of traffic agents from trajectory data. We apply the framework to multilane freeway traffic employing NGSIM I-80 trajectory data set and careful data selection. Our case study indicates the existence of collective cooperativeness between human-driven passenger cars and trucks in real-world traffic and reveals its other properties that are otherwise unknown.</description>

      <title>Deeply nested structure of mythological traditions worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All human societies present unique narratives that shape their customs and beliefs. Despite cultural differences, some symbolic elements (e.g., heroes and tricksters) are common across many cultures. Here, we reconcile these seemingly contradictory aspects by analyzing mythological themes and traditions at various scales. Our analysis revealed that global mythologies exhibit both geographic and thematic nesting across different scales, manifesting in a layered structure. The largest geographic clusters correspond to the New and Old Worlds, which further divide into smaller bioregions. This hierarchical manifestation closely aligns with historical human migration patterns at a large scale, suggesting that narrative themes were carried through deep history. At smaller scales, the correspondence with bioregions indicates that these themes are locally adapted and diffused into variations across cultures over time. Our approach, which treats myths and traditions as random variables without considering factors like geography, history, or story lineage, suggests that the manifestation of mythology has been well-preserved over time and thus opens exciting research avenues to reconstruct historical patterns and provide insight into human cultural narratives.</description>

      <title>Stability of heterogeneous linear and nonlinear car-following models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves in road traffic are complex collective phenomena with significant implications for traffic engineering, safety and the environment. Despite decades of research, understanding and controlling these dynamics remains challenging. This article examines two classes of heterogeneous car-following models with quenched disorder to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that drive traffic instability and stop-and-go dynamics. Specifically, a scaled heterogeneity model and an additive heterogeneity model are investigated, each of which affects the stability of linear and nonlinear car-following models differently. We derive general linear stability conditions which we apply to specific models and illustrate by simulation. The study provides insights into the role of individual heterogeneity in vehicle behaviour and its influence on traffic stability.</description>

      <title>Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beliefs serve as the foundation for human cognition and decision-making. They guide individuals in deriving meaning from their lives, shaping their behaviors, and forming social connections. Therefore, a model that encapsulates beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for quantitatively studying the influence of beliefs on our actions. Despite its importance, research on the interplay between human beliefs has often been limited to a small set of beliefs pertaining to specific issues, with a heavy reliance on surveys or experiments. Here, we propose a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. We discover that the positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals. Furthermore, we find that the relative distance between one's existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing us to predict new beliefs. Our study highlights how modern LLMs, when combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Improving the use of social contact studies in epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social contact studies, investigating social contact patterns in a population sample, have been an important contribution for epidemic models to better fit real life epidemics. A contact matrix $M$, having the \emph{mean} number of contacts between individuals of different age groups as its elements, is estimated and used in combination with a multitype epidemic model to produce better data fitting and also giving more appropriate expressions for $R_0$ and other model outcomes. However, $M$ does not capture \emph{variation} in contacts \emph{within} each age group, which is often large in empirical settings. Here such variation within age groups is included in a simple way by dividing each age group into two halves: the socially active and the socially less active. The extended contact matrix, and its associated epidemic model, empirically show that acknowledging variation in social activity within age groups has a substantial impact on modelling outcomes such as $R_0$ and the final fraction $\tau$ getting infected. In fact, the variation in social activity within age groups is often more important for data fitting than the division into different age groups itself. However, a difficulty with heterogeneity in social activity is that social contact studies typically lack information on if mixing with respect to social activity is assortative or not, i.e.\ do socially active tend to mix more with other socially active or more with socially less active? The analyses show that accounting for heterogeneity in social activity improves the analyses irrespective of if such mixing is assortative or not, but the different assumptions gives rather different output. Future social contact studies should hence also try to infer the degree of assortativity of contacts with respect to social activity.</description>

      <title>Confrontation of capitalism and socialism in Wikipedia networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Ising Network Opinion Formation (INOF) model and apply it for the analysis of networks of 6 Wikipedia language editions. In the model, Ising spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion polarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a given spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The main consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\it capitalism, imperialism} (blue opinion) and {\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These nodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their steady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that the global network opinion favors {\it socialism, communism} for all 6 editions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries and political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We also present results for opinion competition between {\it Christianity} and {\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF approach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.</description>

      <title>Finding the Fairest Voting System using Likelihood Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper takes a statistical approach to determine which of 10 voting systems, or preference aggregation rules, is the fairest based on their probabilistic likelihood of violating Arrow's five social choice criteria. The voting systems considered are: Plurality, Borda, Dowdall, Top Two (Plurality Runoff), Instant Runoff, Coombs, Baldwin, Copeland, Pairwise Majority, and Minimax. This paper builds upon the work of Dougherty and Heckelman (2020) by computing violation frequencies for elections with a greater number of alternatives. Elections with up to 50,000 voters and between three and six alternatives are simulated using both Impartial Culture and Impartial Anonymous Culture. The results of these simulations produce new IIA violation likelihoods for each method and show that Pairwise Majority is the most likely to jointly satisfy all five of Arrow's criteria. Furthermore, of the systems that satisfy transitivity, the Baldwin method is most likely to jointly satisfy all five of Arrow's criteria in elections with three alternatives. As the number of alternatives increase, the joint satisfaction frequencies decrease rapidly for all systems.</description>
