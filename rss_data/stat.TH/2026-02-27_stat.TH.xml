      <title>Sampling from Constrained Gibbs Measures: with Applications to High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a non-standard problem of generating samples from a low-temperature Gibbs distribution with \emph{constrained} support, when some of the coordinates of the mode lie on the boundary. These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics. Key examples of low-temperature Gibbs distributions include Bayesian posteriors, and we demonstrate our results on three canonical examples: a high-dimensional logistic regression model, a Poisson linear model, and a Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <title>Remarks on stationary GARCH processes under heavy tail distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_n)_{n\in \mathbb Z}$ be a GARCH process with $E(X_0^4)&lt;\infty$, and let $\mu_n$ denote the distribution of $\frac 1{{\sqrt n}}\sum_{i=1}^n [X_i^2-\mathbb E(X_0^2)]$. We derive a numerical approximation of $\mu_n$ when $x_1,...,x_n$ are observed. This yields the derivation of confidence intervals for $\mu= E(X_0^2)$ and we investigate the accuracy of these confidence intervals in comparison with standard ones based on normal approximation. Moreover, when the innovation process has heavy tail distribution, we improve the method using a new resampling method.</description>

      <title>Effective sample size approximations as entropy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze alternative effective sample size (ESS) metrics for importance sampling algorithms, and discuss a possible extended range of applications. We show the relationship between the ESS expressions used in the literature and two entropy families, the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropy. The R\'enyi entropy is connected to the Huggins-Roy's ESS family introduced in \cite{Huggins15}. We prove that that all the ESS functions included in the Huggins-Roy's family fulfill all the desirable theoretical conditions. We analyzed and remark the connections with several other fields, such as the Hill numbers introduced in ecology, the Gini inequality coefficient employed in economics, and the Gini impurity index used mainly in machine learning, to name a few.
  Finally, by numerical simulations, we study the performance of different ESS expressions contained in the previous ESS families in terms of approximation of the theoretical ESS definition, and show the application of ESS formulas in a variable selection problem.</description>

      <title>On the errors committed by sequences of estimator functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of estimators $\hat \theta_n$ which converges almost surely to $\theta_0$ as the sample size $n$ tends to infinity. Under weak smoothness conditions, we identify the asymptotic limit of the last time $\hat \theta_n$ is further than $\eps$ away from $\theta_0$ when $\eps \rightarrow 0^+$. These limits lead to the construction of sequentially fixed width confidence regions for which we find analytic approximations. The smoothness conditions we impose is that $\hat \theta_n$ is to be close to a Hadamard-differentiable functional of the empirical distribution, an assumption valid for a large class of widely used statistical estimators. Similar results were derived in Hjort and Fenstad (1992, Annals of Statistics) for the case of Euclidean parameter spaces; part of the present contribution is to lift these results to situations involving parameter functionals. The apparatus we develop is also used to derive appropriate limit distributions of other quantities related to the far tail of an almost surely convergent sequence of estimators, like the number of times the estimator is more than $\eps$ away from its target. We illustrate our results by giving a new sequential simultaneous confidence set for the cumulative hazard function based on the Nelson--Aalen estimator and investigate a problem in stochastic programming related to computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Low-degree Lower bounds for clustering in moderate dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of clustering $n$ points into $K$ groups drawn from a mixture of isotropic Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $\Delta$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $\Delta$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a "non-parametric rate". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Online Risk-Averse Policy Evaluation in POMDPs with Theoretical Guarantees and Novel CVaR Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk-averse decision-making under uncertainty in partially observable domains is a central challenge in artificial intelligence and is essential for developing reliable autonomous agents. The formal framework for such problems is the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where risk sensitivity is introduced through a risk measure applied to the value function, with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) being a particularly significant criterion. However, solving POMDPs is computationally intractable in general, and approximate methods rely on computationally expensive simulations of future agent trajectories. This work introduces a theoretical framework for accelerating CVaR value function evaluation in POMDPs with formal performance guarantees. We derive new bounds on the CVaR of a random variable X using an auxiliary random variable Y, under assumptions relating their cumulative distribution and density functions; these bounds yield interpretable concentration inequalities and converge as the distributional discrepancy vanishes. Building on this, we establish upper and lower bounds on the CVaR value function computable from a simplified belief-MDP, accommodating general simplifications of the transition dynamics. We develop estimators for these bounds within a particle-belief MDP framework with probabilistic guarantees, and employ them for acceleration via action elimination: actions whose bounds indicate suboptimality under the simplified model are safely discarded while ensuring consistency with the original POMDP. Empirical evaluation across multiple POMDP domains confirms that the bounds reliably separate safe from dangerous policies while achieving substantial computational speedups under the simplified model.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation with Mean-Shift Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Support Tokens, Stability Margins, and a New Foundation for Robust LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching is Adaptive to Manifold Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a simulation-free alternative to diffusion-based generative modeling, producing samples by solving an ODE whose time-dependent velocity field is learned along an interpolation between a simple source distribution (e.g., a standard normal) and a target data distribution. Flow-based methods often exhibit greater training stability and have achieved strong empirical performance in high-dimensional settings where data concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold, such as text-to-image synthesis, video generation, and molecular structure generation. Despite this success, existing theoretical analyses of flow matching assume target distributions with smooth, full-dimensional densities, leaving its effectiveness in manifold-supported settings largely unexplained. To this end, we theoretically analyze flow matching with linear interpolation when the target distribution is supported on a smooth manifold. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the learned velocity field, and then propagate this estimation error through the ODE to obtain statistical consistency of the implicit density estimator induced by the flow-matching objective. The resulting convergence rate is near minimax-optimal, depends only on the intrinsic dimension, and reflects the smoothness of both the manifold and the target distribution. Together, these results provide a principled explanation for how flow matching adapts to intrinsic data geometry and circumvents the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Structure of Asymptotic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic framework for asymptotic inference is developed in which sample size and parameter variance define a state space. Within this description, Shannon information plays the role of entropy, and an integrating factor organizes its variation into a first-law-type balance equation. The framework supports a cyclic inequality analogous to a reversed second law, derived for the estimation of the mean. A non-trivial third-law-type result emerges as a lower bound on entropy set by representation noise. Optimal inference paths, global bounds on information gain, and a natural Carnot-like information efficiency follow from this structure, with efficiency fundamentally limited by a noise floor. Finally, de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation in the Gaussian-limit case appear as coordinate projections of the same underlying thermodynamic structure. This framework suggests that ensemble physics and inferential physics constitute shadow processes evolving in opposite directions within a unified thermodynamic description.</description>

      <title>A General (Non-Markovian) Framework for Covariate Adaptive Randomization: Achieving Balance While Eliminating the Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging applications increasingly demand flexible covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) methods that support unequal targeted allocation ratios. While existing procedures can achieve covariate balance, they often suffer from the shift problem. This occurs when the allocation ratios of some additional covariates deviate from the target. We show that this problem is equivalent to a mismatch between the conditional average allocation ratio and the target among units sharing specific covariate values, revealing a failure of existing procedures in the long run. To address it, we derive a new form of allocation function by requiring that balancing covariates ensures the ratio matches the target. Based on this form, we design a class of parameterized allocation functions. When the parameter roughly matches certain characteristics of the covariate distribution, the resulting procedure can balance covariates. Thus, we propose a feasible randomization procedure that updates the parameter based on collected covariate information, rendering the procedure non-Markovian. To accommodate this, we introduce a CAR framework that allows non-Markovian procedure. We then establish its key theoretical properties, including the boundedness of covariate imbalance in probability and the asymptotic distribution of the imbalance for additional covariates. Ultimately, we conclude that the feasible randomization procedure can achieve covariate balance and eliminate the shift.</description>

      <title>Testing Partially-Identifiable Causal Queries Using Ternary Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider hypothesis testing of binary causal queries using observational data. Since the mapping of causal models to the observational distribution that they induce is not one-to-one, in general, causal queries are often only partially identifiable. When binary statistical tests are used for testing partially-identifiable causal queries, their results do not translate in a straightforward manner to the causal hypothesis testing problem. We propose using ternary (three-outcome) statistical tests to test partially-identifiable causal queries. We establish testability requirements that ternary tests must satisfy in terms of uniform consistency and present equivalent topological conditions on the hypotheses. To leverage the existing toolbox of binary tests, we prove that obtaining ternary tests by combining binary tests is complete. Finally, we demonstrate how topological conditions serve as a guide to construct ternary tests for two concrete causal hypothesis testing problems, namely testing the instrumental variable (IV) inequalities and comparing treatment efficacy.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Joint Inference for Sensitivity and Specificity at the Youden-Optimal Cut-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity and specificity evaluated at an optimal diagnostic cut-off are fundamental measures of classification accuracy when continuous biomarkers are used for disease diagnosis. Joint inference for these quantities is challenging because their estimators are evaluated at a common, data-driven threshold estimated from both diseased and healthy samples, inducing statistical dependence. Existing approaches are largely based on parametric assumptions or fully nonparametric procedures, which may be sensitive to model misspecification or lack efficiency in moderate samples. We propose a semiparametric framework for joint inference on sensitivity and specificity at the Youden-optimal cut-off under the density ratio model. Using maximum empirical likelihood, we derive estimators of the optimal threshold and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity, and establish their joint asymptotic normality. This leads to Wald-type and range-preserving logit-transformed confidence regions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves accurate coverage with improved efficiency relative to existing parametric and nonparametric alternatives across a variety of distributional settings. An analysis of COVID-19 antibody data demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed approach for diagnostic decision-making.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Laplace asymptotics up to the concentration threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional Laplace-type integrals of the form $I(\lambda):=\int_{\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-\lambda f(x)}dx$ in the regime where $d$ and $\lambda$ are both large. Until now, rigorous bounds for Laplace expansions in growing dimension have been restricted to the "Gaussian-approximation" regime, known to hold when $d^2/\lambda\to0$. This excludes many practically relevant regimes, including those arising in physics and modern high-dimensional statistics, which operate beyond this threshold while still satisfying the concentration condition $d/\lambda\to0$. Here, we close this gap. We develop an explicit asymptotic expansion for $\log I(\lambda)$ with quantitative remainder bounds that remain valid throughout this intermediate region, arbitrarily close to the concentration threshold $d/\lambda\to0$.
  Fix any $L\ge1$ and suppose $g(0)=1$. Assume that, in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$, the operator norms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are bounded independently of $d$ and $\lambda$ through orders $2(L+1)$ and $2L$, respectively. Assuming also some mild global growth conditions on $f$ and $g$, we prove that $$ \log I(\lambda)=\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} b_k(f,g)\lambda^{-k}+O(d^{L+1}/\lambda^L),\quad d^{L+1}/\lambda^L\to0, $$ and that the coefficients satisfy $b_k(f,g)= O(d^{k+1})$. Moreover, the coefficients $b_k(f,g)$ coincide with those arising from the formal cumulant-based expansion of $\log I(\lambda)$.
  The proof is constructive and proceeds via explicit polynomial changes of variables that iteratively "quadratize" the exponent while controlling Jacobian effects, thereby avoiding heavy Gaussian concentration machinery. We illustrate the expansion on two representative examples.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Treatment Effects with Unobserved Spatially Varying Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured spatially varying confounders has garnered increasing attention. However, a general framework for identifiability, which is critical for reliable causal inference from observational data, has yet to be advanced. In this paper, we study a linear model with various parametric model assumptions on the covariance structure between the unmeasured confounder and the exposure of interest. We establish identifiability of the treatment effect for many commonly 20 used spatial models for both discrete and continuous data, under mild conditions on the structure of observation locations and the exposure-confounder association. We also emphasize models or scenarios where identifiability may not hold, under which statistical inference should be conducted with caution.</description>

      <title>Mean Estimation from Coarse Data: Characterizations and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Near-Optimal Estimation over Certain Type-2 Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop polynomial-time algorithms for near-optimal minimax mean estimation under $\ell_2$-squared loss in a Gaussian sequence model under convex constraints. The parameter space is an origin-symmetric, type-2 convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and we assume additional regularity conditions: specifically, we assume $K$ is well-balanced, i.e., there exist known radii $r, R &gt; 0$ such that $r B_2 \subseteq K \subseteq R B_2$, as well as oracle access to the Minkowski gauge of $K$. Under these and some further assumptions on $K$, our procedures achieve the minimax rate up to small factors, depending poly-logarithmically on the dimension, while remaining computationally efficient.
  We further extend our methodology to the linear regression and robust heavy-tailed settings, establishing polynomial-time near-optimal estimators when the constraint set satisfies the regularity conditions above. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first general framework for attaining statistically near-optimal performance under such broad geometric constraints while preserving computational tractability.</description>

      <title>Towards a Sharp Analysis of Offline Policy Learning for $f$-Divergence-Regularized Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many offline reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by $f$-divergence regularization, but their sample complexity *defined with respect to regularized objectives* still lacks tight analyses, especially in terms of concrete data coverage conditions. In this paper, we study the exact concentrability requirements to achieve the $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity for offline $f$-divergence-regularized contextual bandits. For reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one, we achieve an $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under single-policy concentrability for the first time via a novel pessimism-based analysis, surpassing existing $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. We also propose a near-matching lower bound, demonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability is necessary to maximally exploit the curvature property of reverse KL. Moreover, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL *does not* belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without pessimistic estimation or single-policy concentrability. We further corroborate our theoretical insights with numerical experiments and extend our analysis to contextual dueling bandits. We believe these results take a significant step towards a comprehensive understanding of objectives with $f$-divergence regularization.</description>

      <title>On the Interpolation Error of Nonlinear Attention versus Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention has become the core building block of modern machine learning (ML) by efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies among input tokens. Its inherently parallelizable structure allows for efficient performance scaling with the rapidly increasing size of both data and model parameters. Despite its central role, the theoretical understanding of Attention, especially in the nonlinear setting, is progressing at a more modest pace.
  This paper provides a precise characterization of the interpolation error for a nonlinear Attention, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and the embedding dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Under a signal-plus-noise data model and for fixed Attention weights, we derive explicit (limiting) expressions for the mean-squared interpolation error. Leveraging recent advances in random matrix theory, we show that nonlinear Attention generally incurs a larger interpolation error than linear regression on random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the input contains a structured signal, particularly if the Attention weights align with the signal direction. Our theoretical insights are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Feature Learning in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to a popular viewpoint, neural networks learn from data by first identifying low-dimensional representations, and subsequently fitting the best model in this space. Recent works provide a formalization of this phenomenon when learning multi-index models. In this setting, we are given $n$ i.i.d. pairs $({\boldsymbol x}_i,y_i)$, where the covariate vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are isotropic, and responses $y_i$ only depend on ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ through a $k$-dimensional projection ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*^{{\sf T}}{\boldsymbol x}_i$. Feature learning amounts to learning the latent space spanned by ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*$.
  In this context, we study the gradient descent dynamics of two-layer neural networks under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\to\infty$, $n/d\to\delta$, while the dimension of the latent space $k$ and the number of hidden neurons $m$ are kept fixed. Earlier work establishes that feature learning via polynomial-time algorithms is possible if $\delta&gt; \delta_{\text{alg}}$, for $\delta_{\text{alg}}$ a threshold depending on the data distribution, and is impossible (within a certain class of algorithms) below $\delta_{\text{alg}}$. Here we derive an analogous threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ for two-layer networks. Our characterization of $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ opens the way to study the dependence of learning dynamics on the network architecture and training algorithm.
  The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ is determined by the following scenario. Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients. Then the gradient becomes smaller and the dynamics becomes dominated by negative directions of the Hessian. The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ corresponds to a phase transition in the spectrum of the Hessian in this second phase.</description>

      <title>Design-based inference for generalized causal effects in randomized experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized causal effect estimands, including the Mann-Whitney parameter and causal net benefit, provide flexible summaries of treatment effects in randomized experiments with non-Gaussian or multivariate outcomes. We develop a unified design-based inference framework for regression adjustment and variance estimation of a broad class of generalized causal effect estimands defined through pairwise contrast functions. Leveraging the theory of U-statistics and finite-population asymptotics, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of regression estimators constructed from individual pairs and per-unit pair averages, even when the working models are misspecified. Consequently, these estimators are model-assisted rather than model-based. In contrast to classical average treatment effect estimands, we show that for nonlinear contrast functions, covariate adjustment preserves consistency but does not admit a universal efficiency guarantee. For inference, we demonstrate that standard heteroskedasticity-robust and cluster-robust variance estimators are generally inconsistent in this setting. As a remedy, we prove that a complete two-way cluster-robust variance estimator, which fully accounts for pairwise dependence and reverse comparisons, is consistent.</description>
