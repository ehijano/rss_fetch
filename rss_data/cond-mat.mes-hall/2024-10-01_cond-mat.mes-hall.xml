      <title>Designing exciton-condensate Josephson junction in quantum Hall heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exciton condensate (EC), a coherent state of electron-hole pairs, has been robustly realized in two-dimensional quantum Hall bilayer systems at integer fillings. However, direct experimental evidence for many of the remarkable signatures of phase coherence, such as an in-plane Josephson effect, has been lacking. In this work, we propose a gate-defined exciton-condensate Josephson junction suitable for demonstrating the Josephson effect in vdW heterostructures. The design is similar to the S-I-S superconducting Josephson junction but functions with a completely different microscopic mechanism: two exciton condensates are spatially separated by a gated region that is nearly layer-polarized, and the variation of layer pseudospin mediates a Josephson coupling sufficiently strong to have an observable effect. The Josephson coupling can be controlled by both the gate voltage and the magnetic field, and we show our design's high range of tunability and experimental feasibility with realistic parameters in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurement of the reappearance of Rabi rotations in semiconductor quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons in solid-state quantum emitters play a crucial role in their performance as photon sources in quantum technology. For resonant driving, phonons dampen the Rabi oscillations resulting in reduced preparation fidelities. The phonon spectral density, which quantifies the strength of the carrier-phonon interaction, is non-monotonous as a function of energy. As one of the most prominent consequences, this leads to the reappearance of Rabi rotations for increasing pulse power, which was theoretically predicted in Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 227403 (2007). In this paper we present the experimental demonstration of the reappearance of Rabi rotations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry requirements for current-induced spin magnetization specific to chiral crystals: Multipole analysis and the hidden spin glide symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin magnetization (CISM) specific to chiral crystals is microscopically analyzed using multipole theory to identify the necessary hopping and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). Tight-binding models capturing the essence of chiral crystals are introduced to investigate the multipole degrees of freedom possessed by the Hamiltonian. The results reveal that chiral SOC has a multipole degree of freedom specific to chiral crystals. Subsequently, the CISM is evaluated numerically and analytically. The results show that in addition to the chiral SOC, hopping along the $z$-axis, which is irrelevant from a multipole perspective, is crucial for CISM. This hopping is required to break the combined symmetry of wavevector translation and spin flipping, which we refer to as spin glide symmetry. This confirms that hopping irrelevant to chirality can play a crucial role in physical properties arising from chirality without contradicting the framework of multipole theory.</description>

      <title>Universal theory of tunable second-order topological corner states induced by interlayer coupling in twist bilayer Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal theory for tunable second-order topological corner states induced by interlayer coupling in bilayer Chern insulators with opposite Chern numbers. We demonstrate that the existence of the topological corner state is determined by the relationship between the twist angle of the bilayer Chern insulators and the normal angles of the two sides of the corner. In addition, the position of these corner states can be sensitively controlled by the twist angle, as confirmed by a rigorous analysis of edge state theory. Our findings serve as a universal theory, opening avenues for the design and realization of higher-order topological materials.</description>

      <title>Classification of Chern Numbers Based on High-Symmetry Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chern number is a crucial topological invariant for distinguishing the phases of Chern insulators. Here we find that for Chern insulators with inversion symmetry, the Chern number alone is insufficient to fully characterize their topology. Specifically, distinct topological phases can be differentiated based on skyrmions at different high-symmetry points. Interfaces between these topological phases exhibit gapless helical states, which provide counter-propagating transport channels and robust quantized transport. Additionally, we identify topological transitions that do not involve changes in the Chern number but can be characterized by transitions of skyrmions between high-symmetry points. These transitions arise due to the toroidal structure of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is generally applicable to two-dimensional periodic lattice system. Our research introduces new degrees of freedom for controlling topological optical transport and deepens the understanding of Chern insulators with inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnons on a dice lattice: topological features and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the topological properties of magnons on a dice lattice, also known as the dual of a more widely studied kagome lattice. This structure has a central atom at the center of the honeycomb lattice, which leads to the formation of a flat band. Magnetic Hamiltonians associated with the magnon bands are scarcely studied in this flat band system, which motivates us on examining an interplay of different magnetic spin interactions, such as the Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), pseudodipolar interaction (PDI) and magnetocrystalline anisotropies in a dice lattice. In particular, the objective is to ascertain their roles in inducing various topological phases and the phase transitions therein. The competing effects of the DMI and the PDI in inducing transitions from either topological to topological or topological to trivial phases are noted and the corresponding results are supported via the magnon band structures, presence (or absence) of edge modes in a nanoribbon geometry, and the transport characteristic, namely the discontinuities in the thermal Hall conductivities. Meanwhile, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy also plays an intriguing role, where distinct (nonuniform) values at the different sublattice sites result in a richer topological landscape with Chern numbers $C = \pm 2$, $\pm 1$, and $0$, while a uniform anisotropy yields only $C = \pm 2$ and $0$. This discrepancy arises from the broken valley symmetry in the nonuniform case. Finally, we have enriched our understanding on the role of the flat band in impacting the topological features by comparing some of the key results with that of a honeycomb structure.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport in quadruple quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental evidence of the Nagaoka ferromagnetism in quantum dot systems by Dehollain et al [1], we search for possible confirmation of such kind of ferromagnetism by analyzing the spin-resolved transport properties of a quadruple quantum dot system focusing on the linear response regime. In particular, we consider four quantum dots arranged in a two-by-two square lattice, coupled to external ferromagnetic source and drain electrodes. Turning on and off the specific conditions for the Nagaoka ferromagnetism to occur by changing the value of the intra-dot Coulomb interactions, we determine the transport coefficients, including the linear conductance, tunnel magnetoresistance and current spin polarization. We show that a sign change of the current spin polarization may be an indication of a ferromagnetic order of Nagaoka type which develops in the system.</description>

      <title>Imaging the diffusive-to-ballistic crossover of magnetotransport in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) is used to probe the local, current-induced electrochemical potential of carriers in graphene near circular electrostatic barriers in an out-of-plane magnetic field ranging from 0 to 1.4 T. These measurements provide nanometer-resolved information about the local motion of carriers, revealing significant changes in carrier dynamics with increasing field strength. At low magnetic fields the electrochemical potential displays a spiral-like pattern, while at high fields it exhibits distinct changes at particular radii. We show that the observed behavior indicates a transition from diffusive to ballistic transport. Additionally, the sharp changes in the measured potential profile at high fields result from the `spirograph' motion of carriers, which creates a local enhancement of the Hall field one cyclotron diameter away from the semiclassical turning point near the electrostatic barrier.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Riemannian metric: a new perspective on the quantum realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, quantum geometry within the Riemannian metric elucidates various exotic phenomena, including the Hall effects driven by Berry curvature and quantum metric. In this work, we propose novel quantum geometries within a pseudo-Riemannian framework to explore unique characteristic of quantum matter. By defining distinct distances on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and incorporating spin degree of freedom, we introduce the Pauli quantum geometric tensor. The imaginary part of this tensor corresponds to the Pauli Berry curvature, leading to the discovery a novel quantum phase: Pauli semimetal in PT-symmetric systems. This phase, characterized by the topological Pauli Chern number, manifests as a two-dimensional Pauli Chern insulator with helical edge states. These topological phases, uniquely revealed by the Pauli-Riemannian metric, go beyond the familiar Riemannian metric, where Berry curvature vanishes due to PT-symmetry. Pauli Chern number can classify helical topological insulator with or without time reversal symmetry. Pseudo-Riemannian metrics offer new insights into quantum materials and extend the scope of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>On the Nonlinear Excitation of Phononic Frequency Combs in Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical analog of optical frequency combs, phononic frequency combs (PFCs), has recently been demonstrated in mechanical resonators via nonlinear coupling among multiple phonon modes. However, for exciting phononic combs in molecules, the requisite strong nonlinear couplings need not be readily present. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an alternative route for the generation of phononic combs in polar molecules. Theoretically, we investigated the radiation and phononic spectra generated from CO molecule possessing relatively large permanent dipole moment with density matrix formalism. By considering rovibronic excitation of the ground-state CO molecule while avoiding the electronic excitation, the contribution of the permanent dipole moment and electric dipole polarizability to the creation of PFCs is demonstrated and distinguished. The finding could motivate the possible extension of combs to molecular systems to offer new avenues in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonian for Twisted TMDs which Exhibit Pressure Dependent Topological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moir\'{e} bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simple, effective, low-energy Hamiltonian. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</description>

      <title>True decoherence-free-subspace derived from a semiconductor double quantum dot Heisenberg spin-trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins in solid systems can inherently serve as qubits for quantum simulation or quantum information processing. Spin qubits are usually prone to environmental magnetic field fluctuations; however, a spin qubit encoded in a decoherence-free-subspace (DFS) can be protected from certain degrees of environmental noise depending on the specific structure of the DFS. Here, we derive the "true" DFS from an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 trimer, which protects the qubit states against both short- and long-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations. We define the spin trimer with three electrons confined in a gate-defined GaAs double quantum dot (DQD) where we exploit Wigner-molecularization in one of the quantum dots. We first utilize the trimer for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which generates a sizable magnetic field difference, $\Delta B_\mathrm{z}$, within the DQD. We show that large $\Delta B_\mathrm{z}$ significantly alters the eigenspectrum of the trimer and results in the "true" DFS in the DQD. Real-time Bayesian estimation of the DFS energy gap explicitly demonstrates protection of the DFS against short-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations in addition to long-wavelength ones. Our findings pave the way toward compact DFS structures for exchange-coupled quantum dot spin chains, the internal structure of which can be coherently controlled completely decoupled from environmental magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Terahertz Spectroscopy for Dual-Gated van der Waals Heterostructures at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a versatile platform to study correlated and topological electron physics. Spectroscopy experiments in the THz regime are crucial, since the energy of THz photons matches that of relevant excitations and charge dynamics. However, their micron-size and complex (dual-)gated structures have challenged such measurements. Here, we demonstrate on-chip THz spectroscopy on a dual-gated bilayer graphene device at liquid helium temperature. To avoid unwanted THz absorption by metallic gates, we developed a scheme of operation by combining semiconducting gates and optically controlled gating. This allows us to measure the clean THz response of graphene without being affected by the gates. We observed the THz signatures of electric-field-induced bandgap opening at the charge neutrality. We measured Drude conductivities at varied charge densities and extracted key parameters, including effective masses and scattering rates. This work paves the way for studying novel emergent phenomena in dual-gated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Visualization of Hard Quasi-1D Superconductivity Induced in Nanowires Deposited on a Quasi-2D Indium film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following significant progress in the visualization and characterization of hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, greatly propelled by reports of Majorana zero modes in nanowire devices, considerable attention has been devoted to investigating the electronic structure at the buried superconducting-semiconducting interface and the nature of the induced superconducting correlations. The properties of that interface and the structure of the electronic wave functions that occupy it determine the functionality and the topological nature of the induced superconducting state. Here, we introduce a novel hybrid platform for proximity-inducing superconductivity in InAs$_{0.6}$Sb$_{0.4}$ nanowires, leveraging a unique architecture and material combination. By dispersing these nanowires over a superconducting Indium film we exploit Indium's high critical temperature of 3.7~K and the anticipated high spin-orbit and Zeeman couplings of InAs$_{0.6}$Sb$_{0.4}$. This design preserves the pristine top facet of the nanowires, making it highly compatible with scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Using this architecture we demonstrate that the mechanical contact supports Cooper-pair transparency as high as 90\%, comparable with epitaxial interfaces. The anisotropic angular response to an applied magnetic field shows the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the parent superconductivity in the Indium film and the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the induced superconductivity in the nanowires. Our platform offers robust and advantageous foundations for studying the emergence of topological superconductivity and the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism using atomic-scale spectroscopic tools.</description>

Abstract: Because of their conveniently tunable optoelectronic properties, semiconductor nanocrystals have become established components for new devices and emergent technologies, in a broad range of applications which include agriculture, medicine, energy harvesting and quantum information. In this work we study the dielectric and quantum confinement effects on excitons confined in single axially symmetric quantum dots, and systematically calculate by means of the configuration interaction method the corresponding Coulomb correlations in the cases of CdSe, CdTe and ZnTe nanocrystals. % to quantify the effects on the system energy due to the Coulomb interaction. We show that effects from the dielectric confinement, although one order of magnitude bigger than those from the quantum confinement, are negligible in the exciton energies because of mutual cancellation of the electron and hole contributions. Regarding the electrostatic interaction, we found for all analyzed cases that the exciton binding energy is below 2\% of the non-interacting electron-hole pair energy. Furthermore, our calculations reveal that the in general the first-order-perturbation correction accounts for 70 \% to 90 \% of the binding energy. These results provide useful information on the magnitude of the confinement effects in II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals, suggesting that a simple perturbative approach may be accurate enough for including the electrostatic interaction in most cases.</description>

      <title>Tuning the proximity induced spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining graphene with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) leads to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the graphene. The induced SOC has a large effect on the low-energy part of the band structure leading to or stabilizing novel phases such as topological phases or superconductivity. Here, the pressure dependence of the SOC strength is investigated in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. We performed magnetoconductance studies, such as weak localization, quantum Hall, and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation measurements to extract the different SOC terms which determine the low-energy band structure of BLG. We find a significant increase of the SOC strengths as a result of the pressure. Our studies highlight the large tunability of SOC coupling strength with pressure, which is important for correlated phases or spin qubits in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a Rice-Mele ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian Thouless pumping intertwines adiabatic quantum control and topological quantum transport and it holds potential for quantum metrology and computing. In this work, we introduce a ladder model featuring two doubly-degenerate bands and we show that adiabatic manipulation of the lattice parameters results in non-Abelian Thouless pumping, inducing both the displacement of an initially localized state and a geometric unitary transformation within the degenerate subspace. Additionally, we show that the structure and symmetry of the ladder model can be understood through its connection to a Yang monopole model. The proposed Hamiltonian can be realized using cold atoms in optical lattices, enabling the experimental demonstration of non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a genuinely quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Violet to near-infrared optical addressing of spin pairs in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins are an important platform for practical quantum technologies. Van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising host as it contains a wide variety of optical emitters, but thus far observations of addressable spins have been sparse, and most of them lacked a demonstration of coherent spin control. Here we demonstrate robust optical readout of spin pairs in hBN with emission wavelengths spanning from violet to the near-infrared. We find these broadband spin pairs exist naturally in a variety of hBN samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range. Furthermore, we identify the optimal wavelengths for independent readout of spin pairs and boron vacancy spin defects co-existing in the same sample. Our results establish the ubiquity of the optically addressable spin pair system in hBN across a broad parameter space, making it a versatile playground for spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Poor-man's Majorana edge mode enabled by specular Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D TI) supports a chiral Majorana edge mode at the interface between a superconductor and a magnetic insulator. The complexity of the materials combination is such that this state has not yet been observed. Here we show that a helical Majorana edge mode appears even in the absence of the magnetic insulator, if the Fermi level of the massless surface electrons is at the Dirac point. Specular Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions is at the origin of the effect. The simplified geometry may favor experimental observation of the helical Majorana mode, although it lacks the topological protection of its chiral counterpart.</description>

      <title>Experimental Online Quantum Dots Charge Autotuning Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. In 20 experimental runs on a device cooled to 25mK, the method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this method against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 hours and 9 minutes, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Conductance properties of an $\alpha$-$T_3$ Corbino disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice in the form of a Corbino disk, characterized by inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, threaded by a tunable magnetic flux. Through exact (analytic) solution of the stationary Dirac-Weyl equation, we compute the transmission probability of the carriers and hence obtain the conductance features for $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ ($\alpha$ denotes the strength of the hopping between the central atom and one of the other two) which allows ascertaining the role of the flat band, alongwith scrutinizing the transport features from graphene to a dice lattice. Our results reveal periodic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the conductance, reminiscent of the utility of the Corbino disk as an electron pump. Further, these results are strongly influenced by parameters, such as, doping level, ratio of the inner and outer radii, magnetic flux, and $\alpha$. Additionally, complex quantum interference effect resulting in the possible emergence of higher harmonic modes and split-peak structures in the conductance, become prominent for smaller $\alpha$ values and larger ratios of the radii. We also find that, away from the charge-neutrality point (zero doping), the conductance oscillations are more pronounced and sensitive to the various parameters, with the corresponding behaviour largely governed via the evanescent wave transport. The Fano factor reveals distinct transport regimes, transitioning from Poissonian to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha &lt; 1$, and from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha = 1$. This setup, thus serves as a fertile ground for studying the generation of quantum Hall current and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in a flat band system, alongwith demonstrating intricate appearance of higher harmonics in electron transport.</description>

      <title>Buried Dirac points in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators: Implications for edge transport and Majorana Kramer Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective excitation of vibrational modes using strong laser pulses has emerged as a powerful material engineering paradigm. However, to realize deterministic control over material properties for device applications, it is desirable to have an analogous scheme without a drive, operating in thermal equilibrium. We here propose such an equilibrium analog of the light-driven paradigm, leveraging the strong coupling between lattice degrees of freedom and the quantum fluctuations of the electric field of a THz micro-cavity. We demonstrate this approach by showing, using \textit{ab initio} data, how electric field fluctuations can induce a sub-dominant ferromagnetic order, on top of the dominant zig-zag antiferromagnet order, in FePS$_3$ close to its N\'eel temperature.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistors for Logic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junction field-effect transistors (JJFETs) have recently re-emerged as promising candidates for superconducting computing. For JJFETs to perform Boolean logic operations, the so-called gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ must be larger than 1. In a conventional JJFET made with a classical channel material, due to a gradual dependence of superconducting critical current on the gate bias, $\alpha_{R}$ is much smaller than 1. In this Letter, we propose a new device structure of quantum enhanced JJFETs in a zero-energy-gap InAs/GaSb heterostructure. We demonstrate that, due to an excitonic insulator quantum phase transition in this zero-gap heterostructure, the superconducting critical current displays a sharp transition as a function of gate bias, and the deduced gain factor $\alpha_{R}$ ~ 0.06 is more than 50 times that (~ 0.001) reported in a classical JJFET. Further optimization may allow achieving a gain factor larger than 1 for logic applications.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>Local Counterdiabatic Driving for Jaynes-Cummings Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jaynes-Cummings (JC) lattices can be constructed by connecting quantum two-level systems with cavities and have been widely studied for polariton many-body states and multipartite entanglement. Although adiabatic evolution has been studied for the generation of many-body states in this system, its reliance on long timescales can lead to serious decoherence. Here we present a scheme that utilizes local counterdiabatic (CD) driving to provide fast and high-fidelity state preparation in JC lattices. The exact CD Hamiltonian for this system contains nonlocal couplings between qubits and cavities at different and distant sites, which causes a challenge in the implementation. Leveraging the symmetries of the eigenstates under both periodic and open boundary conditions, we derive a local CD Hamiltonian that generates the same dynamics as the exact CD Hamiltonian and our numerical simulations confirm this result. We also show that a multipartite W-state can be prepared with high fidelity using this method. The implementation and decoherence of this scheme with superconducting quantum devices are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity in a two-dimensional monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of ferroelectricity (FE) and superconductivity (SC) becomes the frontier of condensed matter research recently especially in the realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Identifying a general strategy to realize coexistence of FE and SC in a single material is extremely important for this active field, but quite challenging thus far. We show in this work that coexistence of robust FE and metallicity/SC can be realized by hole-doping a ferroelectric insulator which hosts antibonding highest valence bands (HVB). Using typical 2D ferroelecrtic SnS monolayer as a concrete example, we demonstrate that 0.30 hole/cell doping leads to enhancement of total polarization mainly ascribed to the increasing of polar displacement and ionic polarization. In addition, due to the strong Fermi surface nesting and prominent softening of out-of-plane acoustic phonon upon hole-doping, SnS can be turned into a single gap superconductor with an unexpectedly high transition temperature (Tc) of ~7 K, whereas the polar phonon mode gives negligible contribution to electron-phonon couplings. Our work provides general principle and realistic material for realizing metallic FE and superconducting FE, which paves the way for reversible and nonvolatile superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle is twice the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton bifurcates. We show that the breakdown of the correspondence between the displacement of a soliton and the Chern number arises from the emergence of a new branch of stable soliton solutions mainly consisting of two neighboring instantaneous Wannier functions. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Band alignment effect in the topological photonic alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a photonic alloy with non-trivial topological properties has been proposed, based on the random mixing of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and magnetized YIG rods. When the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods is less than one, a chiral edge state (CES) of the topological photonic alloy appears in the frequency range of the non-trivial topological gap of the magnetized YIG crystal. In this work, we surprisingly find that by randomly mixing the Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) and magnetized YIG rods in a square lattice, the photonic alloy system with appropriate doping concentrations can present CES in special frequency intervals even when both components support the propagation of bulk states. Analyzing the band structure of two components, we noticed a shift between the first trivial bandgap for PEC and the first topological bandgap for magnetized YIG. When calculating the transmission spectrum of the photonic alloy, we discovered that the frequency range for the topological gap gradually opens from the lower limit frequency of the bandgap for PEC to the bandgap for the magnetized YIG rods. The topological gap opening occurs as the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods increases, creating an effective band alignment effect. Moreover, the topological gap for the photonic alloy is confirmed by calculating the reflection phase winding with the scattering method. Lastly, the gradual appearance of the CES is identified by applying Fourier transformation to real-space electromagnetic fields. Our work broadens the possibilities for flexible topological gap engineering in the photonic alloy system.</description>

      <title>Emergence of reentrant structural modulations far beyond the thermal limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single material can exist in different states, with solids, liquids, and gases being the most familiar examples. In materials, these states can exhibit periodic structures spanning from atomic to macroscopic length scales. The conventional wisdom is that a low-symmetry periodic structure transitions into a high-symmetry structure as temperature increases beyond the critical point, which is defined by a thermal limit. In this work, we demonstrate an unforeseen emergence of low-symmetry modulated structures with a reentrant phase in nanoflakes of two-dimensional TaCo2Te2 far beyond their thermal limit, using in-situ heating transmission electron microscopy. We contend that entropy can drive the reappearance of structural modulations, consistent with predicted dynamic structural instabilities in undistorted TaCo2Te2, and further supported by Raman measurements. These findings not only reveal unexpected phase transitions in a crystalline material but also present a new pathway for creating novel ordered phases in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric imprint of skyrmions in van der Waals bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To effectively track and manipulate topological solitons (e.g. skyrmions) are the key challenge before their applications. Inspired by the idea of sliding ferroelectricity, here a general strategy is proposed to print magnetic skyrmions to electric skyrmions in van der Waals bilayers. Through the proximate interactions, there is an isoperiodic bijection relationship between local dipoles and spin moments. This magnetoelectric imprint effect not only extends the strategies to create electric skyrmions, but also leads to an approach for all-electrical readout/manipulation of magnetic skyrmions.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Resistant Photonic Hash Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum hash function based on Gaussian boson sampling on a photonic quantum computer, aiming to provide quantum-resistant security. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this hash function exhibits strong properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance, which are essential for cryptographic applications. Notably, the estimated number of attempts required for a successful collision attack increases exponentially with the mode counts of the photonic quantum computer, suggesting robust resistance against birthday attacks. We also analyze the sampling cost for physical implementation and discuss potential applications to blockchain technologies, where the inherent quantum nature of the hash computation could provide quantum-resistant security. The high dimensionality of the quantum state space involved in the hashing process poses significant challenges for quantum attacks, indicating a path towards quantum security. Our work lays the foundation for a new paradigm of quantum-resistant hashing with applications in emerging quantum-era information systems.</description>

      <title>Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantum oscillations from boson-mediated interband scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations (QO) in metals refer to the periodic variation of thermodynamic and transport properties as a function of inverse applied magnetic field. QO frequencies are normally associated with semi-classical trajectories of Fermi surface orbits but recent experiments challenge the canonical description. We develop a theory of composite frequency quantum oscillations (CFQO) in two-dimensional Fermi liquids with several Fermi surfaces and interband scattering mediated by a dynamical boson, e.g. phonons or spin fluctuations. Specifically, we show that CFQO arise from oscillations in the fermionic self-energy with anomalous frequency splitting and distinct strongly non-Lifshitz-Kosevich temperature dependencies. Our theory goes beyond the framework of semi-classical Fermi surface trajectories highlighting the role of many-body effects. We provide experimental predictions and discuss the effect of non-equilibrium boson occupation in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall effect in transition metals from first-principles scattering calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use first-principles scattering calculations based upon wave-function matching and implemented with a tight-binding MTO basis to evaluate the orbital Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ for Ti, V, Cr, Cu and Pt metals with temperature-induced lattice disorder. Only interatomic fluxes of orbital angular momentum are included in these estimates; intraatomic fluxes which do not contribute to the transfer of angular momentum are explicitly excluded. The resistivity and orbital Hall angle are both found to be linear in temperature so $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ is at most weakly temperature dependent. The value of $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ we obtain for bulk Cr is $ \approx 2 \times 10^3 (\hbar/e) \, (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$ which is substantially lower than previously obtained theoretical results but agrees well with experiment. In units of $10^3 (\hbar/e) (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$, the values obtained for Ti, V and Pt are $5$, $6$ and $7$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Chirality-dependent second-order spin current in systems with time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin currents proportional to the first- and second-order of the electric field are calculated in a specific tight-binding model with time-reversal symmetry. Specifically, a tight-binding model with time-reversal symmetry is constructed with chiral hopping and spin-orbit coupling. The spin conductivity of the model is calculated using the Boltzmann equation. As a result, it is clarified that the first-order spin current of the electric field vanishes, while the second-order spin current can be finite. Furthermore, the spin current changes its sign by reversing the chirality of the model. The present results reveal the existence of spin currents in systems with time-reversal symmetry depending on the chirality of the system. They may provide useful information for understanding the chirality-dependent spin polarization phenomena in systems with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ultrafast electron spin transport across nanometer-thick copper layers using broadband terahertz spectroscopy. Our analysis of temporal delays, broadening and attenuation of the spin-current pulse revealed ballistic-like propagation of the pulse peak, approaching the Fermi velocity, and diffusive features including a significant velocity dispersion. A comparison to the frequency-dependent Ficks law identified the diffusion-dominated transport regime for distances larger than 2 nm. The findings lie the groundwork for designing future broadband spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Confining Dirac fermions in graphene by electrostatic fields is a challenging task. Electric quantum dots created by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip can trap zero-energy quasi-particles. The Lorentzian quantum well provides a faithful, exactly solvable, approximation to such a potential, hosting zero-energy bound states for certain values of the coupling constant. We show that in this critical configuration, the system can be related to the free particle model by means of a supersymmetric transformation. The revealed shape invariance of the model greatly simplifies the calculation of the zero modes and naturally explains the degeneracy of the zero energy.</description>

Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds.

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of graphene-fluorographene nanoribbons: Controllable semiconductor-metal transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene channels ($2$--$4$~nm wide) embedded within fluorographene, focusing on two distinct interfaces: the fully fluorinated $\alpha$ interface and the half-fluorinated $\beta$ interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that $\alpha\alpha$ systems exhibit semiconducting behavior with antiferromagnetic ordering, closely resembling pristine zigzag graphene nanoribbons. In contrast, $\alpha\beta$ systems display ferromagnetism and a width-dependent semiconductor-to-metal transition. To enable the study of larger systems, we develop and validate effective Hubbard models for both $\alpha\alpha$ and $\alpha\beta$ channels. Building upon DFT results and a Wannier function analysis, these models accurately reproduce the electronic structure and magnetic ordering observed in DFT calculations. Crucially, our $\alpha\beta$ model successfully captures the semiconductor-to-metal transition. Application of this model to larger systems reveals the persistence of a ferromagnetic state with spin polarization localized at the $\alpha$ edge. Our results demonstrate the potential of fluorination for targeted property engineering and provide a basis for exploring graphene-fluorographene systems in device applications ranging from microelectronics to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>

Abstract: A recent work [arXiv:2402.04639] considered the dynamical equations for ferromagnets using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics with fundamental variables magnetization $\vec{M}$ and spin current $\vec{J}_{i}$. The resulting equations have the same structure as Leggett's Fermi liquid theory for the nuclear paramagnet $^{3}$He. Specifically, $\partial_{t}\vec{J}_{i}$ contains a term varying as $\partial_{i}\vec{M}$ that we interpret as associated with a vector spin pressure, and a term giving a mean-field along $\vec{M}$, about which $\vec{J}_{i}$ precesses. (There is also a slow decay term in $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ not normally present in the Leggett equations, which are intended for shorter-time spin-echo experiments.) The present work applies Fermi liquid theory to $\vec{J}_{i}$ of ferromagnets. The resulting dynamical equation for $\vec J_i$ confirms the form of $\vec J_i$ found in [arXiv:2402.04639], but now the previously unknown non-dissipative parameters are given in terms of the quasiparticle interaction parameters of Fermi liquid theory. In the paramagnetic limit the present theory agrees with Leggett and related work.</description>

      <title>Magnetoconductivity of Dirac semimetals and chiral magnetic effect from Keldysh technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of hypothesis and is based on the sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</description>

      <title>Favorable phase transitions induced by spinful electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional semimetal with a quadratic band crossing point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of marginally spinful electron-electron interactions on the low-energy instabilities and favorable phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) spin-$1/2$ semimetal that owns a quadratic band crossing point (QBCP) parabolically touched by the upper and lower bands. In the framework of a renormalization group procedure, all sorts of interactions are treated on the equal footing to derive the coupled energy-dependent evolutions of all interaction couplings that govern the low-energy properties. Deciphering the essential physical information of such flows, we at first find that the tendencies of interaction parameters fall into three categories including Limit case, Special case, and General case based on the initial conditions. In addition, the 2D QBCP system is attracted to several distinct kinds of fixed points (FPs) in the interaction-parameter space, namely $\mathrm{FP}_1^{+}$/$\mathrm{FP}_2^{-}$, $\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}$/ $\mathrm{FP}_2^{\pm}$/$\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}$, and $\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with the subscripts characterizing the features of FPs for the Limit, Special, and General cases, respectively. Furthermore, as approaching these FPs, we demonstrate that the spinful fermion-fermion interactions can induce a number of favorable instabilities accompanied by certain phase transitions. Specifically, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH), quantum spin Hall (QSH), and nematic (Nem.) site(bond) states are dominant for $\mathrm{FP}_{1}^{\pm}$, $\mathrm{FP}_{2}^{\pm}$, and $\mathrm{FP}_{3}^{\pm}$, respectively. Rather, QSH becomes anisotropic nearby $\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with one component leading and the others subleading. Besides, Nem.site(bond), chiral superconductivity, and nematic-spin-nematic (NSN.) site(bond) are subleading candidates around these FPs.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect for Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as quantum indicators of the skin effect.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH). In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. The resulting mobility is somewhat higher than that of the relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. However, it is very similar to the mobility obtained from Ehrenfest dynamics, at least in the parameter regimes we have investigated here. This is somewhat surprising because Ehrenfest dynamics overheats the electronic subsystem and is therefore inconsistent with the equilibrium distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one resembles the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual single-electron back-and-forth tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple two-band superconductor with trivial band topology, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch states.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Reduction of Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover an exceptional reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 {\deg}C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower resistivity (~34 microOhm.cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP, at room temperature) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility, as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>
