      <title>Jet Image Tagging Using Deep Learning: An Ensemble Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mode decomposition for detecting transient activity via sparsity and smoothness regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven modal decomposition technique that extracts coherent spatio-temporal structures from high-dimensional time-series data. By decomposing the dynamics into a set of modes, each associated with a single frequency and a growth rate, DMD enables a natural modal decomposition and dimensionality reduction of complex dynamical systems. However, when DMD is applied to transient dynamics, even if a large number of modes are used, it remains difficult to interpret how these modes contribute to the transient behavior. In this study, we propose a simple extension of DMD to overcome this limitation by introducing time-varying amplitudes for the DMD modes based on sparsity and smoothness regularization. This approach enables identification of dynamically significant modes and extraction of their transient activities, providing a more interpretable and faithful representation of non-steady dynamics. We apply the proposed method to fluid flow data exhibiting transient behavior and demonstrate that it can capture the temporal structure of mode activations that are not accessible with the standard DMD method.</description>

      <title>On the Practical Use of Blaschke Decomposition in Nonstationary Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Blaschke decomposition-based algorithm, {\em Phase Dynamics Unwinding} (PDU), possesses several attractive theoretical properties, including fast convergence, effective decomposition, and multiscale analysis. However, its application to real-world signal decomposition tasks encounters notable challenges. In this work, we propose two techniques, divide-and-conquer via tapering and cumulative summation (cumsum), to handle complex trends and amplitude modulations and the mode-mixing caused by winding. The resulting method, termed {\em windowed PDU}, enhances PDU's performance in practical decomposition tasks. We validate our approach through both simulated and real-world signals, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Framework for Exploring Mathematical Patterns in Physics: A Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast corpus of physics equations forms an implicit network of mathematical relationships that traditional analysis cannot fully explore. This work introduces a graph-based framework combining neural networks with symbolic analysis to systematically discover and validate mathematical patterns across physics domains. Starting from 659 equations, we performed rigorous semantic disambiguation to resolve notational polysemy affecting 213 equations, then focused on 400 advanced physics equations by excluding elementary mechanics to emphasize inter-branch connections of modern physics. This corpus was represented as a weighted knowledge graph where a Graph Attention Network achieved 97.4% AUC in link prediction, significantly outperforming classical baselines. The framework's primary value emerges from its dual capability: generating hypotheses and auditing knowledge. First, it functions as a hypothesis generator, producing hundreds of candidate cross-domain connections, from blackbody radiation coupled with Navier-Stokes equations to radioactive decay linked with electromagnetic induction. Second, through symbolic analysis of 30 equation clusters, it serves as a computational auditor that verified established theory consistencies, synthesized the Magnetic Reynolds Number from electromagnetic-fluid coupling, and revealed how even parsing errors could potentially point toward legitimate research like analog gravity. This proof-of-concept intentionally over-generates candidates to ensure comprehensive exploration of mathematical possibility space. Even tautologies and errors serve scientific purposes: redundancy identification and knowledge base quality assessment. The system transforms the intractable combinatorial space into a filtered stream of mathematical patterns for human interpretation.</description>
