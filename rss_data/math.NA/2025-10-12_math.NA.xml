      <title>Augmented data and neural networks for robust epidemic forecasting: application to COVID-19 in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty. The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system, making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region (Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>LR-WaveHoltz: A Low-Rank Helmholtz Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-rank method for solving the Helmholtz equation. Our approach is based on the WaveHoltz method, which computes Helmholtz solutions by applying a time-domain filter to the solution of a related wave equation. The wave equation is discretized by high-order multiblock summation-by-parts finite differences. In two dimensions we use the singular value decomposition and in three dimensions we use tensor trains to compress the numerical solution. To control rank growth we use step-truncation during time stepping and a low-rank Anderson acceleration for the WaveHoltz fixed point iteration. We have carried out extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the convergence and efficacy of the iterative scheme for free- and half-space problems in two and three dimensions with constant and piecewise constant wave speeds.</description>

      <title>Inverse obstacle scattering with a single moving emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with time domain forward scattering and inverse scattering problems with a single moving point source as the emitter. Approximate solutions are provided for the forward scattering problem with a moving emitter. Regarding the inverse problem, in addition to a basic indicator function based on the approximate solutions, a novel indicator function is developed to construct the direct sampling method to recover both point-like and extended scatterers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective in reconstructing both two-dimensional and three-dimensional scatterers with a single moving emitter.</description>

      <title>A time-space B-spline integrator for the Burgers' equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new algorithm for obtaining approximate solutions to the Burgers' equation (BE). Integration in time by a quadratic B-spline collocation method is shown. To the best of our knowledge, B-splines have not previously been used to integrate partial differential equations in both time and space. First, the BE is integrated using quadratic B-spline functions in time, and then the time-integrated BE is further solved in space via the cubic B-spline collocation method. The resulting recursive algebraic equation is used to obtain both shock wave and front propagation solutions of the BE, demonstrating the effectiveness of the space--time B-spline collocation method.</description>

      <title>A Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method for heterogeneous mixed-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multiscale method for mixed-dimensional elliptic problems with highly heterogeneous coefficients arising, for example, in the modeling of fractured porous media. The method is based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) framework and constructs locally supported, problem-adapted basis functions on a coarse mesh that does not need to resolve the coefficient oscillations. These basis functions are obtained in parallel by solving localized fine-scale problems. Our a priori error analysis shows that the method achieves optimal convergence with respect to the coarse mesh size, independent of the coefficient regularity, with an exponentially decaying localization error. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings and demonstrate the computational viability of the method.</description>

      <title>A posteriori analysis for nonlinear convection-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides reliable a posteriori error estimates for Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlinear convection-diffusion systems. The classes of systems we study are quite general with a focus on convection-dominated and degenerate parabolic problems. Our a posteriori error bounds are valid for a family of discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations and various temporal discretizations that include explicit and implicit-explicit time-stepping schemes, popular tools for practical simulations of this class of problem. We prove that our estimators provide reliable upper bounds for the error of the numerical method and present numerical evidence showing that they achieve the same order of convergence as the error. Since one of our main interests is the convection dominant case, we also track the dependence of the estimator on the viscosity coefficient.</description>

      <title>Optimal higher-order convergence rates for parabolic multiscale problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a higher-order multiscale method for time-dependent problems with highly oscillatory coefficients. Building on the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) framework, we construct enriched correction operators to enrich the multiscale spaces, ensuring higher-order convergence without requiring assumptions on the coefficient beyond boundedness. This approach addresses the challenge of a reduction of convergence rates when applying higher-order LOD methods to time-dependent problems. Addressing a parabolic equation as a model problem, we prove the exponential decay of these enriched corrections and establish rigorous a priori error estimates. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Hybrid Monte Carlo / Deterministic Methods for Particle Transport Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents multi-level hybrid transport (MLHT) methods for solving the neutral particle Boltzmann transport equation. The proposed MLHT methods are formulated on a sequence of spatial grids using a multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach. The general MLMC algorithm is defined by the recursive estimation of the expected value of a solution functional's correction with respect to a neighboring grid. MLMC theory optimizes the total computational cost for estimating a functional to within a target accuracy. The proposed MLHT algorithms are based on the quasidiffusion (Variable Eddington Factor) and second-moment methods. For these methods, the low-order equations for the angular moments of the high-order transport solution are discretized in space. Monte Carlo techniques compute the closures for the low-order equations; then, the equations are solved, yielding a single realization of the global flux solution. The ensemble average of the realizations yields the level solution. The results for 1-D slab transport problems demonstrates weak convergence of the functionals considered. We observe that the variance of the correction factors decreases faster than the increase in computational costs of generating an MLMC sample. In the problems considered, the variance and costs of the MLMC solution are driven by the coarse grid calculations.</description>

      <title>Block encoding with low gate count for second-quantized Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient block encoding of many-body Hamiltonians is a central requirement for quantum algorithms in scientific computing, particularly in the early fault-tolerant era. In this work, we introduce new explicit constructions for block encoding second-quantized Hamiltonians that substantially reduce Clifford+T gate complexity and ancilla overhead. By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians. We also achieve an improved constant factor in the Clifford gate count of our oracle. Furthermore, we design a block encoding that directly targets the $\eta$-particle subspace, thereby reducing the subnormalization factor from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, and improving fault-tolerant efficiency when simulating systems with fixed particle numbers. Building on the block encoding framework developed for general many-body Hamiltonians, we extend our approach to electronic Hamiltonians whose coefficient tensors exhibit translation invariance or possess decaying structures. Our results provide a practical path toward early fault-tolerant quantum simulation of many-body systems, substantially lowering resource overheads compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Intelligent backpropagated neural networks application on Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity in a composite porous channel filled with an anisotropic porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity within a channel that is partially filled with a porous medium. To enhance its practical relevance, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic with permeability varying in all directions, making it a positive semidefinite matrix in the momentum equation. We assume the Navier-Stokes equations govern the flow in the free flow region, while the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy's equation governs the flow inside the porous medium. The coupled system contains a nonlinear term from the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an approximate solution using an iterative method valid for a wide range of porous media parameter values. For both high and low values of the Darcy number, the asymptotic solutions derived from the regular perturbation method and matched asymptotic expansion show good agreement with the numerical results. However, these methods are not effective in the intermediate range. To address this, we employ the artificial Levenberg-Marquardt method with a back-propagated neural network (ALMM-BNN) paradigm to predict the solution in the intermediate range. While it may not provide the exact solutions, it successfully captures the overall trend and demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. This highlights the potential of the ALMM-BNN paradigm as a robust predictive tool in challenging parameter ranges where numerical solutions are either difficult to obtain or computationally expensive. The current model provides valuable insights into the shear stress distribution of arterial blood flow, taking into account the variable viscosity of the blood in the presence of inertial effects. It also offers a framework for creating glycocalyx scaffolding and other microfluidic systems that can mimic the biological glycocalyx.</description>

      <title>Weights initialization of neural networks for function approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization, and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full code is made publicly available on Gitee.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Inference using Bayesian Quadrature: the Art of Acquisition Functions and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating posteriors and the associated model evidences is a core issue of Bayesian model inference, and can be of great challenge given complex features of the posteriors such as multi-modalities of unequal importance, nonlinear dependencies and high sharpness. Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) has emerged as a competitive framework for tackling this challenge, as it provides flexible balance between computational cost and accuracy. The performance of a BQ scheme is fundamentally dictated by the acquisition function as it exclusively governs the generation of integration points. After reexamining one of the most advanced acquisition function from a prospective inference perspective and reformulating the quadrature rules for prediction, four new acquisition functions, inspired by distinct intuitions on expected rewards, are primarily developed, all of which are accompanied by elegant interpretations and highly efficient numerical estimators. Mathematically, these four acquisition functions measure, respectively, the prediction uncertainty of posterior, the contribution to prediction uncertainty of evidence, as well as the expected reduction of prediction uncertainties concerning posterior and evidence, and thus provide flexibility for highly effective design of integration points. These acquisition functions are further extended to the transitional BQ scheme, along with several specific refinements, to tackle the above-mentioned challenges with high efficiency and robustness. Effectiveness of the developments is ultimately demonstrated with extensive benchmark studies and application to an engineering example.</description>

      <title>Residual-Informed Learning of Solutions to Algebraic Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error) of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through error control mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: In order to construct quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves with shape parameter, one parameter family of trigonometric Bernstein basis functions are introduced. We study the total positivity of the basis functions to analyze the shape preserving properties of the quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves. We also showed that quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves can be evaluated by two different recursive evaluation algorithms. Finally, we have defined rational counterpart of quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves and show that the rational quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves posses nice shape preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Third Order Newton's Method for Zernike Polynomial Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1329</link>
      <description>arXiv:0705.1329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zernike radial polynomials are a system of orthogonal polynomials over the unit interval with weight x. They are used as basis functions in optics to expand fields over the cross section of circular pupils. To calculate the roots of Zernike polynomials, we optimize the generic iterative numerical Newton's Method that iterates on zeros of functions with third order convergence. The technique is based on rewriting the polynomials as Gauss Hypergeometric Functions, reduction of second order derivatives to first order derivatives, and evaluation of some ratios of derivatives by terminating continued fractions.
  A PARI program and a short table of zeros complete up to polynomials of 40th order are included.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial coarsening on Parareal convergence for the linear advection equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parareal parallel-in-time integration method often performs poorly when applied to hyperbolic partial differential equations. This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</description>

      <title>Development of discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic systems that preserve a curl or a divergence constraint: the case of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some hyperbolic systems are known to include implicit preservation of differential constraints: these are for example the time conservation of the curl or the divergence of a vector that appear as an implicit constraint. In this article, we show that this kind of constraint can be easily conserved at the discrete level with the classical discontinuous Galerkin method, provided the right approximation space is used for the vectorial space, and under some mild assumption on the numerical flux. For this, we recall a discrete de-Rham framework in which discontinuous approximation spaces for vectors fits. The discrete adjoint divergence and curl are proven to be exactly preserved by the discontinuous Galerkin method under a small assumption on the numerical flux. Numerical tests are performed on the wave system, the two dimensional Maxwell system and the induction equation, and confirm that the differential constraints are preserved at machine precision while keeping the high order of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Randomized methods for dynamical low-rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel dynamical low-rank methods for solving large-scale matrix differential equations, motivated by algorithms from randomized numerical linear algebra. In terms of performance (cost and accuracy), our methods overperform existing dynamical low-rank techniques. Several applications to stiff differential equations demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and low variance of the new methods, despite their inherent randomness. Allowing augmentation of the range and corange, the new methods have a good potential for preserving critical physical quantities such as the energy, mass and momentum. Numerical experiments on the Vlasov-Poisson equation are particularly encouraging.
  The new methods comprise two essential steps: a range estimation step followed by a post-processing step. The range estimation is achieved through a novel dynamical rangefinder method. Subsequently, we propose two methods for post-processing, leading to two time-stepping methods: dynamical randomized singular value decomposition (DRSVD) and dynamical generalized Nystr\"om (DGN). The new methods naturally extend to the rank-adaptive framework by estimating the error via Gaussian sampling.</description>

      <title>Multilinear analysis of quaternion arrays: theory and computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\mathbb{H}\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data.</description>

      <title>The piston effect in supercritical fluids investigated via a reversible-irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</description>

      <title>Restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration through low rank tensor approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov--Poisson system. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using a randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm with lazy evaluation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure Numerical Flow Iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the Numerical Flow Iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the sets of solvability for Hermite multivariate interpolation problems when the sum of multiplicities is at most $2n + 2$, with $n$ the degree of the polynomial space. This result extends an earlier theorem (2000) by one of the authors concerning the case $2n+1$. The latter theorem, in turn, can be regarded as a natural extension of a classical Theorem of Severi (1921).</description>

      <title>Finite element discretizations of bending plates with prestrained microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a finite element discretization of an elastic bending-plate model with an effective prestrain. The model has been obtained via homogenization and dimension reduction by B\"onlein at al. (2023). Its energy functional is the $\Gamma$-limit of a three-dimensional nonlinear microstructured elasticity functional. In the derived effective model, the microstructure is incorporated as a local corrector problem, a system of linear elliptic partial differential equations posed on a three-dimensional representative volume element. The discretization uses Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle elements for the macroscopic bending-plate problem on a mesh of scale $H$, and first-order Lagrange elements for the microscopic corrector problem on an axis-aligned mesh of scale $h$. We show that the discretized model $\Gamma$-converges to the continuous one as $(h,H)\to 0$,provided that there exists a microstructure mesh such that the elasticity tensor is Lipschitz continuous on each mesh element. This extends earlier results by Rumpf et al. (2024) to prestrained composites. Our argument does not require any rate of convergence for the microscopic discretization error. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence when $h \to 0$ and $H \to 0$ consecutively, and we prove that these limit processes commute.</description>

      <title>Elastic-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method solving geotechnical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An elastic-plastic cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) is proposed for geotechnical analysis of soils and rocks exhibiting nonlinear and path-dependent behaviors. By introducing strain smoothing over subcell domains and employing a consistent stress return-mapping algorithm, the method enhances stress accuracy, alleviates volumetric locking, and reduces sensitivity to mesh distortion while retaining the flexibility of polygonal elements. The formulation is implemented in ABAQUS via a user-defined element and validated through benchmark and practical problems, including a pressurized thick cylinder, biaxial soil test, strip footing bearing capacity, tunnel excavation, and slope stability. Numerical results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions and conventional FEM, with smoother stress fields, improved convergence, and higher accuracy in ultimate load prediction. These findings demonstrate that CSFEM provides a stable and efficient framework for elastic-plastic analysis of complex geotechnical problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the recent results in polynomial functional regression have been focused on an in-depth exploration of single-parameter regularization schemes. In contrast, in this study we go beyond that framework by introducing an algorithm for multiple parameter regularization and presenting a theoretically grounded method for dealing with the associated parameters. This method facilitates the aggregation of models with varying regularization parameters. The efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed through evaluations on both synthetic and some real-world medical data, revealing promising results.</description>

Abstract: A sequence is difference algebraic (or D-algebraic) if finitely many shifts of its general term satisfy a polynomial relationship; that is, they are the coordinates of a generic point on an affine hypersurface. The corresponding equations are denoted algebraic difference equations (ADEs). We propose a formal definition of D-algebraicity for sequences and investigate algorithms for their closure properties. We show that subsequences of D-algebraic sequences, indexed by arithmetic progressions, satisfy ADEs of the same orders as the original sequences. Additionally, we discuss the special difference-algebraic nature of holonomic and $C^2$-finite sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-timescale gradient descent-ascent (GDA) is a canonical gradient algorithm designed to find Nash equilibria in min-max games. We analyze the two-timescale GDA by investigating the effects of learning rate ratios on convergence behavior in both finite-dimensional and mean-field settings. In particular, for finite-dimensional quadratic min-max games, we obtain long-time convergence in near quasi-static regimes through the hypocoercivity method. For mean-field GDA dynamics, we investigate convergence under a finite-scale ratio using a mixed synchronous-reflection coupling technique.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption, as well as Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>
