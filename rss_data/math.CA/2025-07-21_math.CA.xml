      <title>Polynomial Szemer\'edi for sets with large Hausdorff dimension on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{P}= \{P_1, \cdots, P_{k}\in \mathbb{R}[y]\}$ be a collection of polynomials with distinct degrees and zero constant terms. We proved that there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(\mathbb{P})&gt;0$ such that, for any compact set $E \subset \mathbb{T}$ with dim(E)$&gt;1-\epsilon$, we can find $y\neq 0$ so that $\{x,x+P_1(y), \cdots,x+P_k(y)\} \subset E$. The proof relies on a suitable version of the Sobolev smoothing inequality with ideas adapted from Peluse \cite{P19}, Durcik and Roos \cite{DR24}, and Krause, Mirek, Peluse, and Wright \cite{KMPW24}. As a byproduct of our Sobolev smoothing inequality, we demonstrated that the divergence set of the pointwise convergence problem for certain polynomial multiple ergodic averages has Hausdorff dimension strictly less than one.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of certain multiple Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional integral operators on the Hardy space $H^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the boundedness of the multiple Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional integral operators involving Fox's $H$-function on the Hardy space $H^1$. Our results generalize recent results of Kwok-Pun Ho [Proyecciones 39 (3) (2020), 663--677]. Some useful connections related to the Hausdorff operators are also mentioned.</description>

      <title>Distances in sets of positive Kor\'anyi upper density in Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any measurable set in the Heisenberg group, $\mathbb{H}^n$, of positive upper density has the property that all sufficiently large real numbers are realised as the Kor\'anyi distance between points in that set. The result can be seen as a Heisenberg group analogue to a corresponding Euclidean large distance set result in the $1986$ paper of Bourgain, \cite{1986Bourgain}.
  Along the way, to prove our main theorem, we give the ``decay" of the coefficients $R_{k}(\lambda, \sigma)$, appearing in the spectral decomposition of the group Fourier transform, $\hat{\sigma}(\lambda)$ $= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} R_{k}(\lambda, \sigma) \mathcal{P}_{k}(\lambda)$, of the surface measure $\sigma$ on the Kor\'anyi sphere in $\mathbb{H}^n$, in a certain ``high frequency" region, that is, when $2(2k+n) |\lambda| \gg 1$; which seems to be new in the literature. We also show that the positive upper density cannot be qualitatively improved further.</description>

      <title>On an entropy inequality for quadratic forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a non-degenerate rational quadratic form. Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $(s, C)$-Frostman random variables whose ranges are contained in $[-c_1, c_1]$, with $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $C,c_1\geq 1$. We prove that there exist a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(s,\phi)$ and an integer $N=N(s,C,c_1,\phi)$ such that
  $$\max\left\{H_n(X+Y),\,H_n(\phi(X,Y))\right\} \ge n(s+\epsilon)$$
  for all $n&gt;N$. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case. As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$E_\delta(A+A) + E_\delta(\phi(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$.</description>

      <title>A Vitali-type lemma for the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Take a set of balls in $\mathbb R^d$. We find a subset of pairwise disjoint balls whose combined perimeter controls the perimeter of the union of the original balls. This can be seen as a boundary version of the Vitali covering lemma.
  We further prove combined volume-perimeter results and counterexamples and apply them to find short proofs of some regularity statements for maximal functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal polynomial approximants and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. An electrostatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between two seemingly distant fields: the set of cyclic functions $f$ in a Hilbert space of analytic functions over the unit disc $\D$, on the one hand, and the families of orthogonal polynomials for a weight on the unit circle $\T$ (OPUC), on the other. This link is established by so-called Optimal Polynomial Approximants (OPA) to $1/f$, that is, polynomials $p_n$ minimizing the norm of $1-p_nf$, among all polynomials $p_n$ of degree up to a given $n$.
  Here, we focus on the particular case of the Hardy space, and an electrostatic interpretation of the zeros of those OPA (and thus, of the corresponding OPUC) is studied. We find the electrostatic laws explaining the position of such zeros for a reduced but significant class of examples. This represents the first step towards a research plan proposed over a decade ago to understand zeros of OPA through their potential theoretic properties.</description>

      <title>Level sets of prevalent Weierstrass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-Weierstrass function is defined as $W_g^{\alpha,b}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b^{-\alpha k} g(b^k x)$, where $g$ is a Lipschitz function on the unit circle. For a prevalent $\alpha$-Weierstrass function, we prove that the upper Minkowski dimension of every level set is at most $1-\alpha$, and the Hausdorff dimension of almost every level set equals $1-\alpha$ with respect to its occupation measure. We further demonstrate that the occupation measure of a prevalent $\alpha$-Weierstrass function is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Consequently, the result on the Hausdorff dimension of level sets applies to a set of level sets with positive Lebesgue measure. A central tool in our analysis is the Weierstrass embedding. For a sufficiently large dimension $d$, we construct Lipschitz functions $g_0, g_1, \ldots, g_{d-1}$ such that the mapping $x \mapsto \big(W_{g_0}^{\alpha,b}(x), W_{g_1}^{\alpha,b}(x), \ldots, W_{g_{d-1}}^{\alpha,b}(x)\big)$ is $\alpha$-bi-H\"older. We also prove that such an embedding requires at least $1/\alpha$ coordinate functions.</description>

      <title>Consistent rational approximations of power series, trigonometric series and series of Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For trigonometric series and series of Chebyshev polynomials, we defined trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e and Hermite-Jacobi approximations, linear and nonlinear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations. We established criterion of the existence and uniqueness of trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials, associated with an arbitrary set of $k$ trigonometric series, and we found explicit form of these polynomials. Similar results were obtained for linear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations. We made examples of systems of functions for which trigonometrical Hermite-Jacobi approximations are existed but aren't the same as trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e approximations. Similar examples were made for linear and nonlinear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study analytic self-maps of the unit disk for which the hyperbolic diameters of the images of hyperbolic balls of radius 1 are uniformly bounded below. We give several characterizations of such maps involving the behaviour along geodesic rays, Aleksandrov-Clark measures, zero sets and critical sets.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution of some random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalue distribution of a class of kernel random matrices whose $(i,j)$-th entry is $f(X_i,X_j)$ where $f$ is a symmetric function belonging to the Paley-Wiener space $\mathcal{B}_c$ and $(X_i)_{1\leq i \leq N}$ are i.i.d. random variables.
  We rigorously prove that, with high probability, the eigenvalues of these random matrices are well approximated by those of an underlying estimator.
  A particularly notable case is when $f=sinc$ , which has been widely studied due to its relevance in various scientific fields, including machine learning and telecommunications.
  In this case, we push forward the general approach by computing the eigenvalues of the estimator. More precisely, we have proved that the eigenvalues are concentrated around zero and one. In particular, we address the case of large values of $c$ with respect to the matrix size $N$, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in the literature. Furthermore, we establish that the frequency of eigenvalues close to one is proportional to $c$. Numerical results are provided in order to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

Abstract: This note reviews the Peano-Baker series and its use to solve the general linear system of ODEs. The account is elementary and self-contained, and is meant as a pedagogic introduction to this approach, which is well known but usually treated as a folklore result or as a purely formal tool. Here, a simple convergence result is given, and two examples illustrate that the series can be used explicitly as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{G},\circ)$ be a stratified Lie group. We estimate the Hausdorff dimension (with respect to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric) of the singular sets in $\mathbb{G}$, where a positive solution of the Heat equation corresponding to a sub-Laplacian, blows up faster than a prescribed rate along normal limits, in terms of the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{G}$ and the rate of the blowup parameter. This generalizes a classical result of Watson for the Euclidean Heat. We also obtain a corresponding sharpness result, which is new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Isochronous waveforms of Li\'enard equations via commutative factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isochronous waveform solutions of homogeneous Li\'enard equations are obtained by a modification of the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-P\'erez.
  The scheme is based on the assumption that the intermediate function $\Phi$ that can be introduced in this factorization method depends on both
  the dependent and independent variables of the nonlinear equation. The method is applied to three cases, a noted cubic anharmonic oscillator, a Li\'enard-reduced form of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver evolution equation, and the cubic-quintic Wilson's Li\'enard equation. All these cases are written in a commutative factored form that allows to obtain the general solutions as solutions of a certain type of Bernoulli differential equation. A theorem is also given asserting the general form of the Li\'enard equation, i.e., for given polynomial degree n of its coefficients, which can be solved by this method. The conditions under which these equations can be also approached by non-local transformations are established.</description>

Abstract: Simple asymptotic expansions for the Jacobi functions $P_\nu^{(\alpha, \beta)}(z)$ and $Q_\nu^{(\alpha, \beta)}(z)$ for large degree $\nu$, with fixed parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are surprisingly rare in the literature, with only a few special cases covered. This paper addresses this notable gap by deriving simple (inverse) factorial expansions for these functions, complemented by explicit and computable error bounds. Additionally, we provide analogous results for the associated functions $\mathsf{Q}_\nu^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)$ and $\mathrm{Q}_\nu^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Composition structure of polyconvolution associated with index Kontorovich-Lebedev transform and Fourier integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Kakichev's classical concept and extending Yakubovich-Britvina's approach (\textit{Results. Math.} 55(1-2):175-197, 2009) and (\textit{Integral Transforms Spec. Funct.} 21(4):259--276, 2010) for setting up Kontorovich-Lebedev convolution operators, this paper proposes a new polyconvolution structure associated with the KL-transform and Fourier integrals. Our main contributions include demonstrating a one-dimensional Watson-type transform, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for this transform to serve as unitary on $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and inferring its inverse operator in symmetric form. The existence of this structure over specific function spaces and its connection with previously known convolutions are pointed out. Establish the Plancherel-type theorem, prove the convergence in the mean-square sense in $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and prove the boundedness of dual spaces via Riesz-Thorin's theorem. Derives new weighted $L_p$-norm inequalities and boundedness in a three-parametric family of Lebesgue spaces. These theoretical findings are applied to solve specific classes of the Toeplitz-Hankel equation, providing a priori estimations based on the established conditions for $L_1$ solvability.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic polynomials vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic polynomial in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some presumably new constructions of nontrivial harmonic functions whose zero sets are unions of affine subspaces.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants so that it reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>
