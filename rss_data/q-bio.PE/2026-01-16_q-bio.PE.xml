      <title>Absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs, under different updating rules. While in Moran process a single neighbour is randomly chosen to be replaced, in proliferation processes other neighbours can be replaced using Bernoulli or binomial draws depending on $0 &lt; p \leq 1$. There is a critical value $p_c$ such that the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of fixation probability depending on whether $p &gt; p_c$ or $p &lt; p_c$.
  We clarify the role of symmetries for computing the fixation time in Moran process. We show that the Maruyama-Kimura symmetry depend on the graph structure induced in each state, implying asymmetry for all graphs except cliques and cycles. There is a fitness value, not necessarily $1$, beyond which the fixation time decreases monotonically.
  We apply Harris' graphical method to prove that the fixation time decreases monotonically depending on $p$. Thus there exists another value $p_t$ for which the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of time. However, at the critical level $p=p_c$, the proliferation is highly advantageous when $r \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>From Ecological Connectivity to Outbreak Risk: A Heterogeneous Graph Network for Epidemiological Reasoning under Sparse Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating population-level prevalence and transmission dynamics of wildlife pathogens can be challenging, partly because surveillance data is sparse, detection-driven, and unevenly sequenced. Using highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 clade 2.3.4.4b as a case study, we develop zooNet, a graph-based epidemiological framework that integrates mechanistic transmission simulation, metadata-driven genetic distance imputation, and spatiotemporal graph learning to reconstruct outbreak dynamics from incomplete observations. Applied to wild bird surveillance data from the United States during 2022, zooNet recovered coherent spatiotemporal structure despite intermittent detections, revealing sustained regional circulation across multiple migratory flyways. The framework consistently identified counties with ongoing transmission weeks to months before confirmed detections, including persistent activity in northeastern regions prior to documented re-emergence. These signals were detectable even in areas with sparse sequencing and irregular reporting. These results show that explicitly representing ecological processes and inferred genomic connectivity within a unified graph structure allows persistence and spatial risk structure to be inferred from detection-driven wildlife surveillance data.</description>

      <title>Topological Percolation in Urban Dengue Transmission: A Multi-Scale Analysis of Spatial Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial organization of dengue cases in the city of Recife, Brazil, from 2015 to 2024, using tools from statistical physics and topological data analysis. Reported cases are modeled as point clouds in a metric space, and their spatial connectivity is studied through Vietoris-Rips filtrations and zero-dimensional persistent homology, which captures the emergence and collapse of connected components across spatial scales. By parametrizing the filtration using percentiles of the empirical distance distribution, we identify critical percolation thresholds associated with abrupt growth of the largest connected component. These thresholds define distinct geometric regimes, ranging from fragmented spatial patterns to highly concentrated, percolated structures. Remarkably, years with similar incidence levels exhibit qualitatively different percolation behavior, demonstrating that case counts alone do not determine the spatial organization of transmission. Our analysis further reveals pronounced temporal heterogeneity in the percolation properties of dengue spread, including a structural rupture in 2020 characterized by delayed or absent spatial percolation. These findings highlight percolation-based topological observables as physically interpretable and sensitive descriptors of urban epidemic structure, offering a complementary perspective to traditional spatial and epidemiological analyses.</description>

      <title>An agent-based modelling approach to investigate the impact of gender on tuberculosis transmission in Uganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2023, it returned to being the leading cause of death from an infectious agent globally, replacing COVID-19; in the nineteenth century, one in seven of all humans died of tuberculosis. More than 10 million people are diagnosed with TB every year. The majority of cases in adults occur in males (62.5% of all global adult cases in 2023, compared to 37.5% in females). The main reasons for males suffering from a higher burden of global TB cases, compared to females, may be in large part due to population-scale factors, such as employment type, the quantity and type of social contacts they make, and their health-seeking behaviours (e.g. differences in diagnostic and treatment delays between genders). To investigate which population-scale factors are most important in determining this higher TB burden in males, we have developed an age- and gender-stratified, spatially heterogeneous epidemiological agent-based model. We have focused specifically on Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is a high-burden TB country. We considered counterfactual scenarios to elucidate the impact of gender on the epidemiology of TB. Setting disease progression parameters equal between the genders leads to a reduction in both male-to-female case ratio and total case numbers.</description>

      <title>The multi-allelic Moran process as a multi-zealot voter model: exact results and consequences for diversity thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moran process is a foundational model of genetic drift and mutation in finite populations. In its standard two-allele form with population size $n$, allele counts, and hence allele frequencies, change through stochastic replacement and mutation, yet converge to a stationary distribution. This distribution undergoes a qualitative transition at the \emph{critical mutation rate} $\mu_c=1/(2n)$: at $\mu=\mu_c$ it is exactly uniform, so that the probability of observing $k$ copies of allele~1 (and $n-k$ of allele~2) is $\pi(k)=1/(n+1)$ for $k=0,\dots,n$. For $\mu&lt;\mu_c$ diversity is low: the stationary distribution places most of its mass near $k=0$ and $k=n$, and the population is therefore typically dominated by one allele. For $\mu&gt;\mu_c$, on the other hand, diversity is high: the distribution concentrates around intermediate values, so that both alleles are commonly present at comparable frequencies. Recently, the two-allele Moran process was shown to be exactly equivalent to the voter model with two candidates and $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ committed voters (\emph{zealots}) in a population of $n+\alpha_1+\alpha_2$, where mutation is played by zealot influence. Here we extend this equivalence to multiple alleles and multiple candidates. Using the mapping, we derive the exact stationary distribution of allele counts for well-mixed populations with an arbitrary number $m$ of alleles, and obtain the critical mutation rate $\mu_c = 1/(m+2n-2)$, which depends explicitly on $m$. We then analyze the Moran process on randomly connected populations and show that both the stationary distribution and $\mu_c$ are invariant to network structure and coincide with the well-mixed results. Finally, simulations on general network topologies show that structural heterogeneity can substantially reshape the stationary allele distribution and, consequently, the level of genetic diversity.</description>

      <title>Gene genealogies in diploid populations evolving according to sweepstakes reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is central for understanding ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction (heavy right-tailed offspring number distribution) is central for understanding the ecology and evolution of highly fecund natural populations. Sweepstakes reproduction can induce jumps in type frequencies and multiple mergers in gene genealogies of sampled gene copies. We take sweepstakes reproduction to be skewed offspring number distribution due to mechanisms not involving natural selection, such as in chance matching of broadcast spawning with favourable environmental conditions. Here, we consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction in a diploid panmictic populations absent selfing and evolving in a random environment. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time Beta and Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents, when combining the results the skewness parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from $0$ to $2$, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring produced by any pair of parents; {\it (ii)} in large populations time is measured in units proportional to either $N/\log N$ or $N$ generations (where $2N$ is the population size when constant); {\it (iii)} it follows that incorporating population size changes leads to time-changed coalescents with the time-change independent of $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that the ancestral process is not well approximated by the corresponding coalescent (as measured through certain functionals of the processes); {\it (v)} whenever the skewness of the offspring number distribution is increased the conditional (conditioned on the population ancestry) and the unconditional ancestral processes are not in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>
