      <title>Persistence and extinction dynamics in a stochastic predator-prey model with emergent Allee effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Allee effect describes a decline in population fitness at low densities, potentially leading to extinction. In predator-prey systems, an emergent Allee effect can arise due to interactions such as density-dependent maturation rates and predation constraints. This work studies a stochastic predator-prey model where the prey population is structured into juvenile and adult stages, with maturation following a nonlinear function. We introduce Ito-type stochastic perturbations in mortality rates to account for environmental variability. We first establish the positivity of solutions and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of the trivial equilibrium, prey extinction, and conditional predator extinction. We then analyze prey persistence under specific maturation rate functions. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and their ecological implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations, decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the impact of fear in the presence of additional food and prey refuge with nonlocal predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many positive and negative factors present in the predator-prey interaction which affect the net growth of the species. Fear of predation is one such factor that creates psychological stress in a prey species, which causes a negative impact on their overall growth. This work considers a predator-prey model where the prey species faces a reduction in their growth out of fear, and the predator has an alternative food source that helps the prey to hide in a safer place. As an extension into the nonlocal spatio-temporal model, a nonlocal term is considered in the prey growth to incorporate a fear-effect range around their spatial location. Linear stability analysis helps to analyze the temporal model and produces a wide range of interesting results, including the presence of a certain amount of fear or even prey refuge, which helps in population coexistence. Furthermore, the numerical simulations of the local and nonlocal spatio-temporal models show different types of spatial-temporal patterns, such as Turing and non-Turing patterns. Nevertheless, an increase in fear level reduces the range of the Turing domain for the local model, whereas the opposite happens when the range of nonlocal interaction is increased.</description>

      <title>Vector encoding of phylogenetic trees by ordered leaf attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of work to connect phylogenetics with machine learning, there has been considerable recent interest in vector encodings of phylogenetic trees. We present a simple new "ordered leaf attachment" (OLA) method for uniquely encoding a binary, rooted phylogenetic tree topology as an integer vector. OLA encoding and decoding take linear time in the number of leaf nodes, and the set of vectors corresponding to trees is a simply-described subset of integer sequences. The OLA encoding is unique compared to other existing encodings in having these properties. The integer vector encoding induces a distance on the set of trees, and we investigate this distance in relation to the NNI and SPR distances.</description>
