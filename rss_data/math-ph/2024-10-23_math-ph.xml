      <title>Undecidability in Physics: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Algebraic Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been some recent interest in applying the techniques of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) to entanglement problems in perturbative QFT. In particular, the Hilbert space independence of this formulation makes it particularly interesting in the context of curved spacetimes and the emphasis on the algebra of observables makes the treatment of Bell inequalities in QFT resemble such treatment in non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. In this work, we present the mathematical structures needed for formulating AQFT in terms of the Haag-Araki-Kastler (HAK) axioms and discuss their implications. Moreover, we discuss the algebraic approach to quantum entanglement in the form of Bell inequalities. We provide an extension of this formulation to general globally hyperbolic spacetimes using the so-called Locally Covariant approach to QFT, which extends the HAK axioms to general spacetimes by means of the Category Theory language.</description>

      <title>The second order Huang-Yang formula to the 3D Fermi gas: the Gross-Pitaevskii regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a system of $N$ fermions of spin $1/2$, with its interaction potential of scattering length $a$, the classical Huang-Yang formula state that the energy density $e(\rho)$ is of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  e(\rho)=\frac{3}{5}(3\pi^2)^{\frac{2}{3}}\rho^{\frac{5}{3}}+2\pi a\rho^2
  +\frac{12}{35}(11-2\ln2)3^{\frac{1}{3}}\pi^{\frac{2}{3}}a^2\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}
  +o(\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}).
  \end{equation*}
  We consider a general system of $N$ fermions of spin $1/\mathbf{q}$ with the scattering length of the interaction potential at the scale $a=N^{-1}$ i.e. in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We prove the 2nd order ground state energy approximation corresponding to the Huang-Yang formula. This is a preliminary version of the paper including the main structure of the proof and the computation of the Huang-Yang formula. The full papaer including all Lemmas' proofs and a more proper introduction will be uploaded soon. The thermodynamic limit case shares a similar logic, and could be dealt with in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Gap Probability Distribution of Gaussian Unitary Ensembles and Painlev\'{e} V Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hankel determinant generated by the moments of the even weight function ${\rm e}^{-x^2}(A+B\theta(x^2-a^2)), x\in(-\infty,+\infty), a&gt;0, A\ge0, A+B\ge0$. It is intimately related to the gap probability of the Gaussian unitary ensembles on $(-a,a)$ or $(-\infty,-a)\cup(a,+\infty)$. We derive the ladder operators for the monic polynomials orthogonal with respect to this weight function and three supplementary conditions. By using them and differentiating the orthogonality relation, we get difference and Riccati equations for the two auxiliary quantities introduced in the ladder operators. From these equations, we obtain a second-order difference equation and a second-order second-degree ordinary differential equation satisfied by the coefficient of the three-term recurrence relation for the monic orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, we establish the second-order fourth-degree ordinary differential equation satisfied by the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant. As $n\to\infty$ and $a\to0^{+}$ such that $\tau=2\sqrt{2n}a$ is fixed, this equation is reduced to the $\sigma$-form of a Painlev\'{e} V equation in the variable $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles the problem of spectral characterization of a class of infinite matrices arising from the modelling of small oscillations in a system of interacting particles. The class of matrices under discussion corresponds to the infinite Marchenko-Slavin class. The spectral functions of these matrices are completely characterized and an algorithm is provided for the reconstruction of the matrix from its spectral function. The techniques used in this work are based on recent results for the spectral characterization of infinite band symmetric matrices with so-called degenerations.</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of periodic dimer models and generalized discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic equation for arctic curves of the Aztec diamond with a doubly (quasi-)periodic weight structure and obtain similar results for certain models of the hexagon. In particular, we determine the algebraic degree of such curves as a function of the number of frozen and smooth (or gaseous) regions. The key to our result is the construction of a discriminant for meromorphic differentials on a higher genus Riemann surface. This construction works analogously for meromorphic sections of arbitrary holomorphic line bundles. In the genus $g = 0$ case this notion reduces to the usual discriminant of a polynomial.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for circle compactified 4d $A_1$ class-$S$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a 4d mirror symmetry for the class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch. We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect) Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from Hitchin systems.</description>

      <title>Integrable and critical Haagerup spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first integrable models based on the Haagerup fusion category $H_3$. We introduce a Haagerup version of the anyonic spin chain and use the boost operator formalism to identify two integrable Hamiltonians of PXP type on this chain. The first of these is an analogue of the golden chain; it has a topological symmetry based on $H_3$ and satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $\delta=(3+\sqrt{13})/2$. We prove its integrability using a Lax formalism, and construct the corresponding solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. We present numerical evidence that this model is gapless with a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq 1$. The second integrable model we find breaks the topological symmetry. We present numerical evidence that this model reduces to a CFT in the large volume limit with central charge $c\sim3/2$.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Factorisation of symmetric matrices and applications in gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrices $\mathcal M$ with respect to a contour $\Gamma$. For the case that the quotient $q$ of the two diagonal elements of $\mathcal M$ is a rational function, we show that due to the symmetric nature of the matrix $\mathcal M$, the second column in each of the two matrix factors that arise in the factorisation is determined in terms of the first column in each of these matrix factors, by multiplication by a rational matrix, and we give a method for determining the second columns of these factors. We illustrate our method with two examples in the context of a Riemann-Hilbert approach to obtaining solutions to the Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Exact local conservation of energy in fully implicit PIC algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the issue of strict, fully discrete \emph{local} energy conservation for a whole class of fully implicit local-charge- and global-energy-conserving particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms. Earlier studies demonstrated these algorithms feature strict global energy conservation. However, whether a local energy conservation theorem exists (in which the local energy update is governed by a flux balance equation at every mesh cell) for these schemes is unclear. In this study, we show that a local energy conservation theorem indeed exists. We begin our analysis with the 1D electrostatic PIC model without orbit-averaging, and then generalize our conclusions to account for orbit averaging, multiple dimensions, and electromagnetic models (Darwin). In all cases, a temporally, spatially, and particle-discrete local energy conservation theorem is shown to exist, proving that these formulations (as originally proposed in the literature), in addition to being locally charge conserving, are strictly locally energy conserving as well. In contrast to earlier proofs of local conservation in the literature \citep{xiao2017local}, which only considered continuum time, our result is valid for the fully implicit time-discrete version of all models, including important features such as orbit averaging. We demonstrate the local-energy-conservation property numerically with a paradigmatic numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with systems of spherical particles immersed in a viscous fluid. Two aspects are studied, namely the controllability of such systems, with particular attention to the case of one active particle and either one or two passive ones, and the kinetic limit of such systems as the number of particles diverges. The former issue is tackled in the framework of geometric control theory, whereas the latter resorts to Boltzmann-type formulations of the system of interacting particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Originating from the mathematical modelling of rainfall infiltration, we derive the solution of an initial-boundary value problem of a linear evolution partial differential equation, by using the Fokas method. We present numerical examples which correspond to specific physical rainfall problems. Based on this formalism we present an effective algorithm for the associated null-controllability problem, namely we numerically derive a family of boundary controls that steer the solution to the desired flat final state. Finally, a regularisation scheme allows the derivation of relatively small controls, in cases where this is necessary.</description>

Abstract: The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation for a multi-species inelastic mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A granular gas is a collection of macroscopic particles that interact through energy-dissipating collisions, also known as inelastic collisions. This inelasticity is characterized by a collision mechanics in which mass and momentum are conserved and kinetic energy is dissipated. Such a system can be described by a kinetic equation of the Boltzmann type. Nevertheless, due to the macroscopic aspect of the particles, any realistic description of a granular gas should be written as a mixture model composed of M different species, each with its own mass. We propose in this work such a granular multi-species model and analyse it, providing Povzner-type inequalities, and a Cauchy theory in general Orlicz spaces. We also analyse its large time behavior, showing that it exhibits a mixture analogue of the seminal Haff's Law.</description>

      <title>Quantum spaces associated to mixed polarizations and their limiting behavior on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega, J)$ be a toric variety of dimension $2n$ determined by a Delzant polytope $P$. As indicated in [40], $X$ admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, induced by the action of a subtorus $T^{k}$. In this paper, we first establish the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ for $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, identifying a basis parameterized by the integer lattice points of $P$. This confirms that the dimension of $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ aligns with those derived from K\"ahler and real polarizations. Secondly, we examine a one-parameter family of K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$, defined via symplectic potentials, and demonstrate their convergence to $\mathcal{P}_{k}$. Thirdly, we verify that these polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$ coincide with those induced by imaginary-time flow. Finally, we explore the relationship between the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k,0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{k}$, establishing that ``$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{H}_{k,t} = \mathcal{H}_{k}$."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that formal WKB solutions of Schr\"odinger equations on Riemann surfaces are resurgent. Specifically, they are Borel summable in almost all directions and their Borel transforms admit endless analytic continuation away from a discrete subset of singularities. Our approach is purely geometric, relying on understanding the global geometry of complex flows of meromorphic vector fields using techniques from holomorphic Lie groupoids and the geometry of spectral curves. This framework provides a fully geometric description of the Borel plane, Borel singularities, and the Stokes rays. In doing so, we introduce a geometric perspective on resurgence theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new class of N-dimensional Lie algebras and apply them to integrable systems. In this paper, we obtain a nonisospectral KdV integrable hierarchy by introducing a nonisospectral spectral problem. Then, a coupled nonisospectral KdV hierarchy is deduced by means of the corresponding higher-dimensional loop algebra. It follows that the K symmetries, {\tau} symmetries and their Lie algebra of the coupled nonisospectral KdV hierarchy are investigated. The bi-Hamiltonian structures of the both resulting hierarchies are derived by using the trace identity. Finally, we derive a multi-component nonisospectral KdV hierarchy related to the N-dimensional loop algebra, which generalizes the coupled results to an arbitrary number of components.</description>

Abstract: For any (possibly singular) hyperelliptic curve, we give the definition of a hyperelliptic refined spectral curve and the hyperelliptic refined topological recursion, generalising the formulation for a special class of genus-zero curves by Kidwai and the author, and also improving the proposal by Chekhov and Eynard. Along the way, we uncover a fundamental geometric structure underlying the hyperelliptic refined topological recursion and investigate its properties -- parts of which remain conjectural due to computational difficulties. Moreover, we establish a new recursion valid in the so-called Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit and prove existence of the corresponding quantum curve.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>An Observer-Based View of Euclidean Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence network of events is a view of the universe based on events that may be related to one another via influence. The network of events form a partially-ordered set which, when quantified consistently via a technique called chain projection, results in the emergence of spacetime and the Minkowski metric as well as the Lorentz transformation through changing an observer from one frame to another. Interestingly, using this approach, the motion of a free electron as well as the Dirac equation can be described. Indeed, the same approach can be employed to show how a discrete version of some of the features of Euclidean geometry, including directions, dimensions, subspaces, Pythagorean theorem, and geometric shapes can emerge.
  In this paper, after reviewing the essentials of the influence network formalism, we build on some of our previous works to further develop aspects of Euclidean geometry. Specifically, we present the emergence of geometric shapes, a discrete version of the Parallel postulate, the dot product, and the outer (wedge product) in 2+1 dimensions. Finally, we show that the scalar quantification of two concatenated orthogonal intervals exhibits features that are similar to those of the well-known concept of geometric product in geometric Clifford algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the description of Bell's inequalities in algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) to the context of locally covariant quantum field theory (LCQFT). We use the functorial formulation of the state space as proposed in the seminal work \cite{BFV03} to show that for the suitable subcategory which consists of all possible admissible quadruples, yields a category of states over such observables which satisfy the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Such inequality is trivially preserved under algebraic morphisms and functoriality of the state space asserts us that it is preserved under isometric embeddings between the globally hyperbolic spacetimes where the algebras are defined and which constitute the locally covariant QFT functor.</description>

Abstract: We show that the $n$-point, genus-$g$ correlation functions of topological recursion on any regular spectral curve with simple ramifications grow at most like $(2g - 2 + n)!$ as $g \rightarrow \infty$, which is the expected growth rate. This provides, in particular, an upper bound for many curve counting problems in large genus and serves as a preliminary step for a resurgence analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present the triangular prism equations for fusion categories, demonstrating their equivalence to the pentagon equations in the spherical case, modulo a change of basis. These equations offer valuable insights for managing complexity through localization. Additionally, we establish an enhanced version of Z. Wang's conjecture regarding the second Frobenius-Schur indicator in pivotal fusion categories. As applications, we introduce new categorification criteria and complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to FPdim 20000.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low temperature $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid model on $[[1, L ]]^2$ with zero boundary conditions and nonnegative heights (a floor at height $0$). Caputo et al. (2016) established that this random surface typically admits either $\mathfrak h $ or $\mathfrak h+1$ many nested macroscopic level line loops $\{\mathcal L_i\}_{i\geq 0}$ for an explicit $\mathfrak h\asymp \log L$, and its top loop $\mathcal L_0$ has cube-root fluctuations: e.g., if $\rho(x)$ is the vertical displacement of $\mathcal L_0$ from the bottom boundary point $(x,0)$, then $\max \rho(x) = L^{1/3+o(1)}$ over $x\in I_0:=L/2+[[-L^{2/3},L^{2/3}]]$. It is believed that rescaling $\rho$ by $L^{1/3}$ and $I_0$ by $L^{2/3}$ would yield a limit law of a diffusion on $[-1,1]$. However, no nontrivial lower bound was known on $\rho(x)$ for a fixed $x\in I_0$ (e.g., $x=\frac L2$), let alone on $\min\rho(x)$ in $I_0$, to complement the bound on $\max\rho(x)$. Here we show a lower bound of the predicted order $L^{1/3}$: for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that $\min_{x\in I_0} \rho(x) \geq \delta L^{1/3}$ with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. The proof relies on the Ornstein--Zernike machinery due to Campanino-Ioffe-Velenik, and a result of Ioffe, Shlosman and Toninelli (2015) that rules out pinning in Ising polymers with modified interactions along the boundary. En route, we refine the latter result into a Brownian excursion limit law, which may be of independent interest. We further show that in a $ K L^{2/3}\times K L^{2/3}$ box with boundary conditions $\mathfrak h-1,\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h$ (i.e., $\mathfrak h-1$ on the bottom side and $\mathfrak h$ elsewhere), the limit of $\rho(x)$ as $K,L\to\infty$ is a Ferrari--Spohn diffusion.</description>

LeXInt, written in a modular format, facilitates easy integration into any existing software package, and can be used for temporal integration of any differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the sensitivity of parameter and dissatisfactory precision for physics informed extreme machine learning (called PIELM) with common sigmoid, tangent and gaussian activation functions in solving high order partial differential equations (PDEs) arised from the fields of scientific computation and engineering applications. In this work, a Fourier induced PIELM (dubbed FPIELM) is proposed to approximate the solution for a class of fourth-order biharmonic equations with two types boundary conditions on unitized and non-unitized domains. By calculating carefully the differential operator and boundary operator of biharmonic equation on discretized collections, the solution of this high-order equation is casted into a linear least squares minimization problem. Additionally, we assess our FPIELM method with various hidden nodes and scale factor of uniform distribution initialization, then determine the optimal value range of the two hyperparameters required. Numerical experiments and comparsions for the FPIELM method and the other PIELM methods demonstrate that the proposed FPIELM method is more stable and robust, more high-precious and efficient in addressing biharmonic equations in both regular and irregular domains.</description>

Abstract: We give a criterion based on reflection symmetries in the spirit of Jitomirskaya--Simon to show absence of point spectrum for (split-step) quantum walks and Cantero--Moral--Vel\'azquez (CMV) matrices. To accomplish this, we use some ideas from a recent paper by the authors and their collaborators to implement suitable reflection symmetries for such operators. We give several applications. For instance, we deduce arithmetic delocalization in the phase for the unitary almost-Mathieu operator and singular continuous spectrum for generic CMV matrices generated by the Thue--Morse subshift.</description>

Pure Appl. Anal. 23, 269-303) for Galerkin approximations. To overcome the lack of local compactness in infinite dimensional spaces, we introduce the notion of asymptotic expansions in nested spaces. When the inclusion maps between these spaces are compact, we establish the existence of such an asymptotic expansion for a subsequence of any bounded sequence. This consequently yields an intrinsic asymptotic expansion in a single normed space. We apply this result to the steady states of the Navier-Stokes equations by utilizing the spectral fractional Sobolev spaces. In the case of the two-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, more properties relating the terms of the asymptotic expansion are obtained.</description>

Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study address this problem by investigating the functional expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical experiments on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Letter datasets, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model demonstrates superior feature selection capabilities and substantially reduces the required training steps compared to classical CNNs. Notably, we observe similar performance improvements when incorporating three other quantum-inspired activation functions in classical neural networks, indicating the benefits of adopting quantum-inspired activation functions. Additionally, we developed a hybrid quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network (QCPN) based on the properties of quantum activation functions. We demonstrate that a three-layer QCPN can approximate any continuous function, a feat not achievable by a standard three-layer classical neural network. Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired activation functions can reduce model depth while maintaining high learning capability, making them a promising approach for optimizing large-scale machine-learning models. We also outline future research directions for leveraging quantum advantages in machine learning, aiming to unlock further potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Performant near-term quantum combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16135</link>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a promising application for near-term quantum computers, however, identifying performant algorithms suited to noisy quantum hardware remains as an important goal to potentially realizing quantum computational advantages. To address this we present a variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems with linear-depth circuits. Our algorithm uses an ansatz composed of Hamiltonian generators designed to control each term in the target combinatorial function, along with parameter updates following a modified version of quantum imaginary time evolution. We evaluate this ansatz in numerical simulations that target solutions to the MAXCUT problem. The state evolution is shown to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, and its optimal-solution convergence is further improved using adaptive transformations of the classical Hamiltonian spectrum. With these innovations, the algorithm consistently converges to optimal solutions, with interesting highly-entangled dynamics along the way. We further demonstrate the success of this approach by performing optimization of a truncated version of our ansatz with up to 32 qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer, using measurements from the quantum computer to train the ansatz and prepare optimal solutions with high fidelity in the majority of cases we consider. The success of these large-scale quantum circuit optimizations, in the presence of realistic hardware constraints and without error mitigation, mark significant progress on the path towards solving combinatorial problems using quantum computers. We conclude our performant and resource-minimal approach is a promising candidate for potential quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to graph theory, from a geometric and analytic viewpoint. A finite graph $X$ is described by its adjacency matrix $d\in M_N(0,1)$, which can be thought of as being a kind of discrete Laplacian, and we first discuss the basics of graph theory, by using $d$, and various linear algebra tools. Then we discuss the computation of the classical and quantum symmetry groups $G(X)\subset G^+(X)$, which must leave invariant the eigenspaces of $d$, with the quantum symmetry group $G^+(X)$ being in general bigger than the classical symmetry group $G(X)$.</description>

      <title>Geometric representations of braid and Yang-Baxter gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brick-wall circuits composed of the Yang-Baxter gates are integrable. It becomes an important tool to study the quantum many-body system out of equilibrium. To put the Yang-Baxter gate on quantum computers, it has to be decomposed into the native gates of quantum computers. It is favorable to apply the least number of native two-qubit gates to construct the Yang-Baxter gate. We study the geometric representations of all X-type braid gates and their corresponding Yang-Baxter gates via the Yang-Baxterization. We find that the braid and Yang-Baxter gates can only exist on certain edges and faces of the two-qubit tetrahedron. We identify the parameters by which the braid and Yang-Baxter gates are the Clifford gate, the matchgate, and the dual-unitary gate. The geometric representations provide the optimal decompositions of the braid and Yang-Baxter gates in terms of other two-qubit gates. We also find that the entangling powers of the Yang-Baxter gates are determined by the spectral parameters. Our results provide the necessary conditions to construct the braid and Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A solution of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the generalised quantum Stein's lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $n$ copies of an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ and a generic separable state $\sigma_{A^n:B^n}$, equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an "almost power state". To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call "blurring", which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.</description>

      <title>QRT Map on a Bielliptic Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of mappings of the plane possessing a biquadratic invariant, which is known collectively as QRT maps, is composed of two involutions, one preserving a vertical shift and the other preserving a horizontal shift in the plane. In this paper, we extend the map by replacing each shift by the group operation on each of two families of elliptic curves, whose product forms a bielliptic surface.</description>
