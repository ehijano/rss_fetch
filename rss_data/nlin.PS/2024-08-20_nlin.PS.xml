      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report that conventional saturable periodic structures, in sharp contrast to the conventional systems with different nonlinearities which exhibit the typical S- shaped optical bi- and multi-stable states, reveal some unusual and unique nonlinear dynamics. These include the onset of ramp-like optical bistability (OB) and optical multistability (OM) curves which further transit into mixed OM states combining both ramp-like states followed by the S-shaped multistable curves. We also extend this study to another domain of physics, namely parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)- symmetry, by including equal amount of gain and loss into the system which then establishes additional degree of freedom by enabling the investigation into additional two domains which are the unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetric regimes. Although these bi- and multi-stable states are unusual and unique, when the frequency detuning is introduced, the revival of S-shaped stable states is possible but only in the presence of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry. Conversely, the broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry which usually generates ramp-like multistable states, gives rise to the birth of novel multistable states with a vortex like envelope, (the curve that features simultaneous increase in the critical switch-up and switch-down powers with an increase in the input power) causing a novel structure which has not been reported in the existing literature of different physical systems manifesting multi-stable states.</description>

      <title>Mechanics promotes coherence in heterogeneous active media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of activity among myocytes constituting vital organs, e.g., the heart, is crucial for physiological functions. Self-organized coordination in such heterogeneous ensemble of excitable and oscillatory cells is therefore of clinical importance. We show by varying the strength of intercellular coupling and the electrophysiological diversity, a wide range of collective behavior emerges including clusters of synchronized activity. Strikingly, stretch-activated currents allow waves of mechanical deformation to alter the activity of neighboring cells, promoting robust global coherence.</description>

      <title>Polarization induced buildup and switching mechanisms for soliton molecules composed of noise like pulse transition states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildup and switching mechanisms of solitons in complex nonlinear systems are fundamentally important dynamical regimes. Using a novel strongly nonlinear optical system,the work reveals a new buildup scenario for soliton molecules , which includes a long-duration stage dominated by the emergence of transient NLPs modes to withstand strong disturbances arising from turbulence and extreme nonlinearity in the optical cavity. Systematic simulations reveal effects of the PC rotation angle and intra-cavity nonlinearity on the periodic phase transitions between the different soliton states, and accurately reproduce the experimentally observed buildup and switching mechanisms. These findings could enhance our fundamental study and points to potential uses in designing information encoding systems.</description>

      <title>Excitability and memory in a time-delayed optoelectronic neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an optoelectronic circuit composed of an excitable nanoscale resonant-tunneling diode (RTD) driving a nanolaser diode (LD) coupled via time-delayed feedback. Using a combination of numerical path-continuation methods and time simulations, we demonstrate that this RTD-LD system can serve as an artificial neuron, generating pulses in the form of temporal localized states (TLSs) that can be employed as memory for neuromorphic computing. In particular, our findings reveal that the prototypical delayed FitzHugh-Nagumo model previously employed to model the RTD-LD resembles our more realistic model only in the limit of a slow RTD. We show that the RTD time scale plays a critical role in memory capacity as it governs a shift in pulse interaction from repulsive to attractive, leading to a transition from stable to unstable multi-pulse TLSs. Our theoretical analysis uncovers features and challenges previously unknown for the RTD-LD system, including the multistability of TLSs and attractive interaction forces, stemming from the previously neglected intrinsic dynamics of the laser. These effects are crucial to consider since they define the memory properties of the RTD-LD.</description>
