      <title>Understanding the Consequences of VTuber Reincarnation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of VTubers, digital avatars controlled and voiced by human actors (Nakanohito), has created a lucrative and popular entertainment ecosystem. However, the prevailing industry model, where corporations retain ownership of the VTuber persona while the Nakanohito bears the immense pressure of dual-identity management, exposes the Nakanohito to significant vulnerabilities, including burnout, harassment, and precarious labor conditions. When these pressures become untenable, the Nakanohito may terminate their contracts and later debut with a new persona, a process known as "reincarnation". This phenomenon, a rising concern in the industry, inflicts substantial losses on the Nakanohito, agencies, and audiences alike. Understanding the quantitative fallout of reincarnation is crucial for mitigating this damage and fostering a more sustainable industry. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of VTuber reincarnation, analyzing 12 significant cases using a comprehensive dataset of 728K livestream sessions and 4.5B viewer interaction records. Our results suggest reincarnation significantly damages a Nakanohito's career, leading to a decline in audience and financial support, an increase in harassment, and negative repercussions for the wider VTuber industry. Overall, these insights carry immediate implications for mitigating the significant professional and personal costs of the reincarnation, and fostering a healthier and more equitable VTuber ecosystem.</description>

      <title>FairGE: Fairness-Aware Graph Encoding in Incomplete Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) are increasingly applied to social network analysis, yet their deployment is often constrained by fairness concerns. This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into OpenStreetMap Research Since its Inception (2008-2024): Contributors, Topics, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) has transitioned from a pioneering volunteered geographic information (VGI) project into a global, multi-disciplinary research nexus. This study presents a bibliometric and systematic analysis of the OSM research landscape, examining its development trajectory and key driving forces. By evaluating 1,926 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection and 782 State of the Map (SotM) presentations up to June 2024, we quantify publication growth, collaboration patterns, and thematic evolution. Results demonstrate simultaneous consolidation and diversification within the field. While a stable core of contributors continues to anchor OSM research, themes have shifted from initial concerns over data production and quality toward advanced analytical and applied uses. Comparative analysis of OSM-related research in WoS and SotM reveals distinct but complementary agendas between scholars and the OSM community. Building on these findings, we identify six emerging research directions and discuss how evolving partnerships among academia, the OSM community, and industry are poised to shape the future of OSM research. This study establishes a structured reference for understanding the state of OSM studies and offers strategic pathways for navigating its future trajectory.The data and code are available at https://github.com/ya0-sun/OSMbib.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Responses to Firm-Level News in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms is associated with stock prices and whether these associations extend to firms' suppliers and clients connected through supply chain relationships, using large samples of publicly listed firms worldwide and in Japan. News sentiment is measured using FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned for financial texts, and supply chain links are identified from financial statements for global firms and from large-scale firm-level surveys for Japanese firms. We find that stock prices exhibit systematic associations with positive and negative news even before public disclosure. These associations are also observed for suppliers and clients before and after disclosure. In general, relative to the pre-disclosure period, post-disclosure associations are larger, with the difference concentrated around the time of public news disclosure. However, for Japanese firms, the post-disclosure associations for suppliers and clients are smaller than the pre-disclosure associations, in contrast to the pattern observed for firms outside Japan.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>
