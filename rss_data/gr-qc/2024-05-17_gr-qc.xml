      <title>Constraining $f({\cal R})$ gravity by Pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021} observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss spherically symmetric dynamical systems in the framework of a general model of $f({\cal R})$ gravity, i.e. $f({\cal R})={\cal R}e^{\zeta {\cal R}}$, where $\zeta$ is a dimensional quantity in squared length units [L$^2$]. We initially assume that the internal structure of such systems is governed by the Krori-Barua ansatz, alongside the presence of fluid anisotropy. By employing astrophysical observations obtained from the pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, derived from bursting X-ray binaries located within globular clusters, we determine that $\zeta$ is approximately equal to $\pm 5$ km$^2$. In particular, the model can create a stable configuration for {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, encompassing its geometric and physical characteristics. In $f({\cal R})$ gravity, the Krori-Barua approach links $p_r$ and $p_t$, which represent the components of the pressures, to ($\rho$), representing the density, semi-analytically. These relations are described as $p_r\approx v_r^2 (\rho-\rho_{I})$ and $p_t\approx v_t^2 (\rho-\rho_{II})$. Here, the expression $v_r$ and $v_t$ represent the radial and tangential sound speeds, respectively. Meanwhile, $\rho_I$ pertains to the surface density and $\rho_{II}$ is derived using the parameters of the model. Notably, within the frame of $f({\cal R})$ gravity where $\zeta$ is negative, the maximum compactness, denoted as $C$, is inherently limited to values that do not exceed the Buchdahl limit. This contrasts with general relativity or with $f({\cal R})$ with positive $\zeta$, where $C$ has the potential to reach the limit of the black hole asymptotically. The predictions of such model suggest a central energy density which largely exceeds the saturation of nuclear density, which has the value $\rho_{\text{nuc}} = 3\times 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$. Also, the density at the surface $\rho_I$ surpasses $\rho_{\text{nuc}}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication to nano-hertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Fractal signatures of non-Kerr spacetimes in the shadow of light-ring bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-ring bifurcations that can occur for prolate non-Kerr compact objects can leave an indelible signature on SMBH shadows as a fractal sequence of eyebrow-like formations. These fractal features are the result of two properties of these spacetimes. The first is that they allow for multiple escapes for the photons (throats in the effective potential of photon geodesic motion). The second is that photon geodesics can resonate between different generalized light-rings related to the escapes, called fundamental photon orbits, that lead photons to alternate between the different exits either towards the compact object or infinity. The resulting fractal structures of the shadow seem to be a generic feature of prolate non-Kerr objects that may be observable in (accretion-disk)-illuminated compact objects, especially along equatorial lines of sight, but the best orientation depends on the specific parameters. Such fractal features, if observed, would be smoking gun signals of non-Kerr compact objects.</description>

      <title>Black bounces in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse black bounce solutions in the recently proposed ``Conformal Killing gravity'' (CKG), by coupling the theory to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. The original motivation of the theory was essentially to fulfil specific criteria that are absent in existing gravitational theories, namely, to obtain the cosmological constant as an integration constant, derive the energy-momentum conservation law as a consequence of the gravitational field equations, rather than assuming it, and not necessarily considering conformally flat metrics as vacuum solutions. In this work, we extend the static and spherically symmetric solutions obtained in the literature, and explore the possibility of black bounces in CKG, coupled to NLED and scalar fields. We find novel NLED Lagrangian densities and scalar potentials, and extend the class of black bounce solutions found in the literature. Furthermore, within black bounce geometries, we find generalizations of the Bardeen-type and Simpson-Visser geometries and explore the regularity conditions of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism invariance and general covariance: a pedagogical introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance is a feature that gets sometimes highlighted as something with profound implications in the physics of spacetime. Moreover, it is often wrongly associated exclusively with General Relativity. The fact that diffeomorphism invariance and general covariance are used interchangeably does not help. Here, we attempt at clarifying these concepts.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularity and Power-Law Solutions in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a higher-dimension Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

      <title>Challenging theories of dark energy with levitated force sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the most outstanding problems in physical science, and various theories have been proposed. It is therefore essential to directly verify or rule out these theories experimentally. However, despite substantial efforts in astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, previous tests have not yet acquired enough accuracy to provide decisive conclusions as to the validity of these theories. Here, using a diamagnetically levitated force sensor, we carry out a test on one of the most compelling explanations for dark energy to date, namely the Chameleon theory, an ultra-light scalar field with screening mechanisms, which couples to normal-matter fields and leaves a detectable fifth force. Our results extend previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude to the entire physical plausible parameter space of cosmologically viable chameleon models. We find no evidence for such a fifth force. Our results decisively rule out the basic chameleon model as a candidate for dark energy. Our work, thus, demonstrates the robustness of laboratory experiments in unveiling the nature of dark energy in the future. The methodology developed here can be further applied to study a broad range of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon chaos beyond Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of outgoing massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric (SSS) black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos within a specific energy range. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum MSS bound [J. Maldacena, S.H. Shenker and D. Stanford, JHEP 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>New insights on null and timelike warped symmetric spacetime splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore in detail the 2+2 and 1+1+2 formalism in spherically symmetric spacetimes, spanning from deducing the dynamical equations to relating them to the well-known generalised Painlev\'e-Gullstrand (GPG) coordinate system. The evolution equations are the Raychaudhuri equations for null rays, including those also known as cross-focusing equations whose derivation, to the best of our knowledge, we present for the first time. We physically interpret the scalars that arise in this scenario, namely the flow 2-expansion $\Theta_{n}$, the flow acceleration $\mathcal{A}$, and the radial extrinsic curvature $\mathcal{B}$. We derive a coordinate independent formula for the redshift which shows that $\mathcal{B}$ is the sole source for the redshift in spherically symmetric spacetimes. We also establish the correspondence between the 1+1+2 scalars and the 1+3 splitting scalars, expansion and shear. We further make a comparison with the Newman-Penrose formalism, in order to clarify the context where each formalism is more useful, and finally, we extend our results to planar and hyperbolic symmetric warped spacetimes as well, in particular, the relationship between $\mathcal{B}$ and the redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of charged rotating wormhole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, supported by anisotropic matter fields. We first revisit the charged static cases and analyze the conditions for the solution to represent a wormhole geometry. The rotating geometry is obtained by applying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static geometry. We show the solutions to Maxwell equations in detail. We believe that our wormhole geometry offers a geometric realization corresponding to the concept of 'charge without charge'.</description>

      <title>Mergers of hairy black holes: Constraining topological couplings from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hairy black-holes are a unique prediction of certain theories that extend General Relativity (GR) with a scalar field. The presence of scalar hair is reflected non-trivially in the entropy of the black hole along with any topological coupling that may be present in the action. Demanding that a system of two merging black holes obeys the global second law of thermodynamics imposes a bound on this topological coupling coefficient. In this work we study how this bound is pushed from its GR value by the presence of scalar hair by considering estimates of binary black-hole merger parameters through inference studies of mock gravitational-wave (GW) events. We find that the scalar charge may produce a statistically significant deviation of the change in entropy over the GR prediction. However, we also find the latter is susceptible to biases arising out of GW inferences which ends up being two orders of magnitude larger, therefore overwhelming any change induced by the scalar hair.</description>

      <title>Most likely configurations for fermion localization in a Braneworld-$f(Q,B_Q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves deeply into braneworld scenarios within modified gravity models, investigating their impact on particle localization and the structure of branes. Through a comprehensive blend of numerical analyses and theoretical inquiries, we unravel a nuanced correlation between deviations from standard General Relativity (GR) and the emergence of split branes. By employing probabilistic measurements, we pinpoint stable configurations that align with brane division intervals, thus challenging prevailing assumptions regarding the gravitational framework of our universe. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the localization of fermions within the brane, exposing intricate dynamics shaped by scalar field characteristics and modifications to gravitational models. By harnessing quantum information measurements, notably Shannon entropy, we discern heightened probabilities of fermion localization within the brane as gravitational models diverge from standard paradigms. This underscores the limitations of General Relativity in comprehensively describing the complexities inherent in our universe. Lastly, our exploration of massive fermions unveils their potential to breach the confines of the brane, hinting at promising avenues for future experimental endeavors aimed at probing the nature of extra dimensions and gravitational interactions. This suggests exciting prospects for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics beyond conventional boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of gravitational-wave background searches to constrain cosmic histories characterised by a stiff equation of state, preceded by a period of matter domination. Such a scenario leads to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave spectrum originating from cosmological inflation. Assuming instant transitions between distinct epochs, which allows an analytical treatment of the gravitational-wave spectrum, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis to derive constraints from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Additionally, we consider a smooth transition, employing an axion-like particle physics model, and highlight the difference with the instant transition approximation. We then forecast detection prospects for such a cosmic history through future gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>The fermionic double smeared null energy condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy conditions are crucial for understanding why exotic phenomena such as traversable wormholes and closed timelike curves remain elusive. In this paper, we prove the Double Smeared Null Energy Condition (DSNEC) for the fermionic free theory in 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time, extending previous work on the same energy condition for the bosonic case [1][2] by adapting Fewster and Mistry's method [3] to the energy-momentum tensor $T_{++}$. A notable difference from previous works lies in the presence of the $\gamma_0 \gamma_+$ matrix in $T_{++}$, causing a loss of symmetry. This challenge is addressed by making use of its square-root matrix. We provide explicit analytic results for the massless case as well as numerical insights for the mass-dependence of the bound in the case of Gaussian smearing.</description>

      <title>Quadratic quasi-normal mode dependence on linear mode parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) uniquely describe the gravitational-wave ringdown of post-merger black holes. While the linear QNM regime has been extensively studied, recent work has highlighted the importance of second-perturbative-order, quadratic QNMs (QQNMs) arising from the nonlinear coupling of linear QNMs. Previous attempts to quantify the magnitude of these QQNMs have shown discrepant results. Using a new hyperboloidal framework, we resolve the discrepancy by showing that the QQNM/QNM ratio is a function not only of the black hole parameters but also of the ratio between even- and odd-parity linear QNMs: the ratio QQNM/QNM depends on what created the ringing black hole, but only through this ratio of even- to odd-parity linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects and light bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from spacetimes of vacuum General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using solutions of vacuum General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes from Interacting Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper charged black holes are obtained assuming that a Born-Infeld electrodynamics may arise from an interaction between the electromagnetic field and a vacuum component. In this context Cauchy horizons do not appear in the maximal analytical extension once an event horizon is formed so that the interior spacetime does not suffer from any sort of instabilities which are well known in the literature. On the contrary, the causal structure exhibits an event horizon -- encapsulating a spacelike singularity -- and a cosmological horizon. We show that the strong cosmic censorship is then restored for a wide range of the parameters including configurations in which the black hole charge is much larger than its mass. We also show that the black hole thus formed described by our solution exhibits an unstable photon sphere analogous to that of the Schwarzschild metric.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Isocurvature with Primordial Non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple fields can become dynamical during the inflationary epoch. We consider an example where a light field acquires isocurvature fluctuations during inflation and contributes to the dark matter abundance at late times. Interactions between the light field and the adiabatic sector contribute to mixed adiabatic-isocurvature non-Gaussianity (NG). We show the resulting form of NG has a different kinematic dependence than the 'local shape' commonly considered, and highlight the parameter space where a dedicated search is expected to significantly improve the current $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. We interpret our results in the context of the QCD axion and illustrate how the proposed NG searches can improve upon the existing searches for isocurvature power spectrum and bispectrum.</description>

      <title>How Stellar Stream Torsion may reveal aspherical Dark Matter Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat rotation curves follow from elongated Dark Matter distributions, as shown by our earlier competitive fits to the SPARC database. Intending to probe that distortion of the DM halo one needs observables not contained by the galactic plane. Stellar streams are caused by tidal stretching of massive substructures such as satellite dwarf galaxies, and would lie on a plane should the DM-halo gravitational field be spherically symmetric. But if the field does not display such spherical symmetry, stellar trajectories, as well as stellar streams, should torsion out of the plane. This is where the torsion of the stream can be of use: it is a local observable that measures the deviation from planarity of a curve; thus, it quantifies how noncentral the gravitational potential is. We have performed small simulations to confirm that indeed a galactic central force produces negligible torsion, and quantified the torsion for prolate haloes instead. Examining observational data, we select several streams at large distance from the galactic center, as most promising for the study, and by means of helicoidal fits extract their differential torsion. We see that their torsion is much larger than expected for a central spherical bulb alone, pointing to an elongated Milky Way halo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the radial action of a spinning probe particle in Kerr spacetime from the worldline formalism in the first-order form, focusing on linear in spin effects. We then develop a novel covariant Dirac bracket formalism to compute the impulse and the spin kick directly from the radial action, generalizing some conjectural results in the literature and providing ready-to-use expressions for amplitude calculations with generic spin orientations. This allows, for the first time, to find new covariant expressions for scattering observables in the probe limit up to $\mathcal{O}(G^6 s_1 s_2^4)$. Finally, we use the action-angle representation to compute the fundamental frequencies for generic bound orbits, including the intrinsic spin precession, the periastron advance and the precession of the orbital plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

      <title>The proper way to spatially decompose the gravitational-wave origin in stellar collapse simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I discuss the possible misleading interpretation based on the incorrect method in the literature that favors the dominant contribution by the PNS convective layer. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method. This work re-emphasizes the global emission picture of GWs from PNS and motivates future prudent analyses with 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Are all models wrong? Falsifying binary formation models in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the catalogue of gravitational-wave transients grows, several entries appear "exceptional" within the population. Tipping the scales with a total mass of $\approx 150 M_\odot$, GW190521 likely contained black holes in the pair-instability mass gap. The event GW190814, meanwhile, is unusual for its extreme mass ratio and the mass of its secondary component. A growing model-building industry has emerged to provide explanations for such exceptional events, and Bayesian model selection is frequently used to determine the most informative model. However, Bayesian methods can only take us so far. They provide no answer to the question: does our model provide an adequate explanation for the data? If none of the models we are testing provide an adequate explanation, then it is not enough to simply rank our existing models - we need new ones. In this paper, we introduce a method to answer this question with a frequentist $p$-value. We apply the method to different models that have been suggested to explain GW190521: hierarchical mergers in active galactic nuclei and globular clusters. We show that some (but not all) of these models provide adequate explanations for exceptionally massive events like GW190521.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit pure quantum cosmology in three dimensions. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be solved perturbatively and the dynamics reduces to a particle on moduli space. Its time evolution is equivalent to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Focusing on spacetimes with torus slices, we show that inflationary cosmologies correspond to particle trajectories in Artin's billiard. The resulting automorphic dynamics is developed both from a first and second quantized perspectives. Our main application is to give an interpretation for the Hartle-Hawking state which is here the analytic continuation of the Maloney-Witten partition function. We obtain its spectral decomposition and an exact representation as an average involving the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski family of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers used to be the most promising candidate for gravitational waves for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as advanced LIGO and advanced VIRGO. This was proved by the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in 2017. Numerical modeling is pivotal in predicting and interpreting binary neutron star mergers. This chapter reviews the progress of fully general relativistic magnetized binary neutron star merger simulations. From 2008 to 2024, about forty numerical relativity simulations of magnetized binary neutron star mergers were conducted with a different level of sophistication. This chapter aims to comprehensively view the magnetohydrodynamics effect in binary neutron star mergers by reviewing all the related works.</description>

Abstract: We explore the Classical Regge Growth conjecture (CRG) in the 4d effective field theory that results from compactifying $D$-dimensional General Relativity on a compact, Ricci-flat manifold. While the higher dimensional description is given in terms of pure Einstein gravity and the conjecture is automatically satisfied, it imposes several non-trivial constraints in the 4d spectrum. Namely, there must be either none or an infinite number of massive spin-2 modes, and the mass ratio between consecutive KK spin-2 replicas is bounded by the 4d coupling constants.</description>

Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the dynamical Casimir effect, the creation of particles from vacuum by dynamical boundary conditions or dynamical background, and its backreaction to the motion of the boundary. The backreaction of particle creation to the boundary motion is studied using quantum field theory in curved spacetime technique, in 1+1 dimension and 3+1 dimension. The relevant quantities in these quantum field processes are carefully analyzed, including regularization of the UV and IR divergent of vacuum energy, and estimation of classical backreaction effects like radiation pressure. We recovered the qualitative result of backreaction in 1+1 dimensions. In the 3+1 dimension, we find that the backreaction tends to slow down the system to suppress the further particle creation, similar to the case of cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

Abstract: Some aspects of atom-field interactions in curved spacetime are reviewed. Of great interest are quantum radiative and entanglement processes arising out of Rindler and black hole spacetimes, which involve the role of Hawking-Unruh and dynamical Casimir effects. Most of the discussion surrounds the radiative part of interactions. For this, we specifically reassess the conventional understandings of atomic radiative transitions and energy level shifts in curved spacetime. We also briefly outline the status quo of entanglement dynamics study in curved spacetime, and highlight literature related to some novel insights, like entanglement harvesting. On one hand, the study of the role played by spacetime curvature in quantum radiative and informational phenomena has implications for fundamental physics, notably the gravity-quantum interface. In particular, one examines the viability of the Equivalence Principle, which is at the heart of Einstein's general theory of relativity. On the other hand, it can be instructive for manipulating quantum information and light propagation in arbitrary geometries. Some issues related to nonthermal effects of acceleration are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of holographic superconductors in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory with spontaneous scalarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic superconductor phase transition and spontaneous scalarization are triggered by the instability of the underlying vacuum black hole spacetime. Although both hairy black hole solutions are closely associated with the tachyonic instability of the scalar degree of freedom, they are understood to be driven by distinct causes. It is, therefore, interesting to explore the interplay between the two phenomena in the context of a scenario where both mechanisms are present. To this end, we investigate the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with a Maxwell field. On the one hand, the presence of the charged scalar and Maxwell fields in anti-de Sitter spacetime furnishes the celebrated framework for a holographic superconductor. On the other hand, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational sector triggers spontaneous scalarization. However, near the transition curve, the two phases are found to be largely indistinguishable regarding both the radial profile and effective potential. This raises the question of whether the hairy black holes triggered by different mechanisms are smoothly joined by a phase transition or whether these are actually identical solutions. To assess the transition more closely, we evaluate the phase diagram in terms of temperature and chemical potential and discover a smooth but first-order transition between the two hairy solutions by explicitly evaluating Gibbs free energy and its derivatives. In particular, one can elaborate a thermodynamic process through which a superconducting black hole transits into a scalarized one by raising or decreasing the temperature. Exhausting the underlying phase space, we analyze the properties and the interplay between the two hairy solutions.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic spin of fermions can generate torsion in spacetime. This torsion is a non-propagating field that can be integrated out, leaving an effective non-universal four-fermion interaction. This geometrical interaction affects fermions inside a matter distribution and can be expected to become stronger as the density grows. In this work, we investigate the role of this interaction in a gravitationally collapsing fermionic distribution. Our specific aim is to explore if this interaction can provide a repulsive contribution and prevent the final singularity formation. We consider a collapsing distribution of massive fermions, ignoring other interactions. Using simplified yet reasonable assumptions, we establish that a repulsive contribution can arise depending on how torsion couples with different chiralities. Also, the interaction starts to dominate as the collapse proceeds, accelerating or decelerating the collapse depending on the relative signs of the geometrical interaction between different species of fermions.</description>

Abstract: The collapse of a spherically symmetric ball of dust has been intensively studied in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). From a quantum theory, it is possible to recover a semiclassical regime through a polymerization procedure. In this setting, general solutions to the polymerized Einstein field equations (PEFE) will be discussed both for the interior and the exterior of the dust cloud. Exterior solutions are particularly interesting since they may lead to a semiclassical version of the Birkhoff's theorem. It is seen that if time independence of the vacuum is imposed, there exists a unique class of solutions depending on two parameters. Nevertheless, the possibility of more intricate time dependent solutions is not ruled out completely. Ultimately, these results will be compared to a model of spherical collapse obtained independently from the Einstein equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric teleparallel F(T) gravity containing a perfect isotropic fluid. We first write the field equations and proceed to find new teleparallel F(T) solutions for perfect isotropic and linear fluids. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe components, we find several classes of new non-trivial teleparallel F(T) solutions. We also find a new class of teleparallel F(T) solutions for a matter dust fluid. After we solve the field equations for a non-linear perfect fluid. Once again, there are several new exact teleparallel F(T) solutions and also some approximated teleparallel F(T) solutions. All these classes of new solutions may be relevant for future cosmological and astrophysical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the power-Maxwell (PM) theory could remove the singularity of the electric field \cite{PM2}. Motivated by a great interest in three-dimensional black holes and a surge of success in studying massive gravity from both the cosmological and astrophysical points of view, we investigate three-dimensional black hole solutions in de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley (dRGT) massive theory of gravity in the presence of PM electrodynamics. First, we extract exact three-dimensional solutions in this theory of gravity. Then we study the geometrical properties of these solutions. Calculating conserved and thermodynamic quantities, we check the validity of the first law of thermodynamics for these black holes. We also examine the stability of these black holes in the context of the canonical ensemble. We continue calculating this kind of black hole's optical features, such as the photon orbit radius, the energy emission rate, and the deflection angle. Considering these optical quantities, finally, we analyze the effective role of the parameters of models on them.</description>

      <title>The integrated perturbation theory for cosmological tensor fields III: Projection effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrated perturbation theory (iPT) is a set of methods in nonlinear perturbation theory for the structure formation in the Universe. In Papers I and II [arXiv:2210.10435, arXiv:2210.11085], the basic formalism and technical methods of the iPT for cosmological tensor fields are developed, generalizing the corresponding theory for scalar fields. In previous papers, methods to predict statistical quantities, such as power spectra, correlation functions, etc., of three-dimensional tensor fields are developed based on the iPT. However, observations of tensors, such as angular momenta and shapes of galaxies, etc., are only possible after the three-dimensional tensors are projected onto the two-dimensional sky. In this paper, power spectra and correlation functions of projected two-dimensional tensors are related to those of original three-dimensional tensors, so that one can make predictions for the observable statistics of projected tensor fields from the iPT. The relations are consistently represented on the basis of irreducible decomposition of both two- and three-dimensional tensors.</description>

      <title>The Dilaton Improves Goldstones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free scalar field is only conformally invariant when non-minimally coupled to gravity. In flat space this amounts to amending, or improving, the energy momentum tensor. A no-go theorem prohibits the improvement for Goldstone bosons, originating from global internal spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is shown that the no-go theorem can be circumvented in the presence of a dilaton. The latter is a (pseudo) Goldstone boson originating from spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking in a theory with an infrared fixed point. Specifically, the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor is demonstrated for a generic $d$-dimensional curved space. Additionally, the Goldstone gravitational form factors are shown to obey conformality constraints in the soft limit. The crucial point is that the remainder term of the soft theorem is non-zero due to the presence of the dilaton pole. For Goldstone systems with a trivial infrared fixed point the leading order analysis of this paper ought to be sufficient. Loop effects govern the improvement term outside the fixed point and are scheme-dependent as briefly discussed towards the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array: IV. Implications for massive black holes, dark matter and the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings and tensor mode generation by non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, in this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigate the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this is the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A visual tool for assessing tension-resolving models in the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models have been proposed to address various shortcomings of the standard cosmological model, such as the ``Hubble tension.'' These models often have an impact on the discrepancy in the amplitude of matter clustering, the ``$\sigma_8$-tension.'' To explore the interplay between the two tensions, we suggest a simple method to visualize the relation between the two parameters: $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$. For a given extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model and dataset, we plot the relation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ for different amplitudes of the beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics. In this work, we use this visualization method to illustrate the trend of selected cosmological models, including nonminimal Higgs-like inflation, early dark energy, a varying effective electron mass, an extra number of relativistic species and modified dark energy models. Although already studied in the literature, some of these models have not been analyzed in view of the two joint tensions. We stress that the method used here could be a useful diagnostic tool to illustrate the behavior of complex cosmological models with many parameters in the context of the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.</description>

      <title>Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\, MHz, $ 2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\, GHz, and $ 6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive gravitational backgrounds that are asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, have a regular black hole horizon and which deep in the interior exhibit mixmaster chaotic dynamics. The solutions are obtained by coupling gravity with a negative cosmological constant to three massive vector fields, within an Ansatz that reduces to ordinary differential equations. At late interior times the equations are identical to those analysed in depth by Misner and by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz fifty years ago. We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group. We compute a large number of eigenvalues numerically to obtain the spectral form factor. While the spectral statistics is anomalous for a chaotic system, the eigenfunctions themselves display random matrix behaviour.</description>

      <title>Causal bounds on cosmological angular correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a new hypothesis for causal coherence of gravitational quantum fluctuations, and test its predicted constraints on large-scale angular correlations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We posit that {\it quantum fluctuations generate physical correlations of gravitational potential only within compact causal diamonds bounded by inflationary horizons}. It is shown that the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of gravitationally-induced CMB anisotropy is thereby constrained by conformally invariant geometry to exactly vanish at large angular separations: even-parity correlation vanishes in a range $\Theta= \pi/2 \pm \arcsin(1/4)$, and total correlation vanishes over a larger range that could extend as far as $\Theta=3\pi/4$. This geometrical causal symmetry is tested with CMB correlations in all-sky maps from the {\sl WMAP} and {\sl Planck} satellites, allowing for unmeasured dipole anisotropy. Correlations in this range of angular separation are indeed found to be much smaller than expected in standard realizations based on local effective quantum field theory, which produce correlations three to four orders of magnitude larger than those in the {\sl Planck} maps, and deviate as little from zero as the maps do with probabilities that range from $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$. These results could indicate that large-angle CMB anisotropy preserves a primordial causal symmetry of quantum gravity that is not included in the standard quantum model of inflation.</description>

      <title>Implications of comprehensive nuclear and astrophysics data on the equations of state of neutron star matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of state (EoSs) governing neutron star (NS) matter obtained for both non-relativistic and relativistic mean-field models are systematically confronted with a diverse set of terrestrial data and astrophysical observations within the Bayesian framework. The terrestrial data, spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions, constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass. Three distinct posterior distributions of EoSs are generated by gradually updating the priors with different constraints: (i) only the maximum NS mass, (ii) incorporating additional terrestrial data, (iii) combining both the terrestrial data and astrophysical observations. These EoS distributions are then compared using the Kullback-Liebler divergence which highlights the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of NS maximum mass and terrestrial data. The remaining astrophysical observations marginally refine the EoS within the density range $\sim$ 2-3$\rho_0$. It is observed that the relativistic mean field model yields stiffer EoS around the saturation density, but predict smaller values of the speed of sound and proton fraction in the interior of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Domain Wall Networks: Impact on Pulsar Timing Arrays and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unstable domain wall (DW) networks in the early universe are cosmologically viable and can emit a large amount of gravitational waves (GW) before annihilating. As such, they provide an interpretation for the recent signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. A related important question is whether such a scenario also leads to significant production of Primordial Black Holes (PBH). We investigate both GW and PBH production using 3D numerical simulations in an expanding background, with box sizes up to $N=3240$, including the annihilation phase. We find that: i) the network decays exponentially, i.e. the false vacuum volume drops as $\sim \exp(-\eta^3)$, with $\eta$ the conformal time; ii) the GW spectrum is larger than traditional estimates by more than one order of magnitude, due to a delay between DW annihilation and the sourcing of GWs. We then present a novel semi-analytical method to estimate the PBH abundances: rare false vacuum pockets of super-Hubble size collapse to PBHs if their energy density becomes comparable to the background when they cross the Hubble scale. Smaller (but more abundant) pockets will instead collapse only if they are close to spherical. This introduces very large uncertainties in the final PBH abundance. The first phenomenological implication is that the DW interpretation of the PTA signal is compatible with observational constraints on PBHs, within the uncertainties. Second, in a different parameter region, the dark matter can be entirely in the form of asteroid-mass PBHs from the DW collapse. Remarkably, this would also lead to a GW background in the observable range of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and future interferometers, such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.</description>

Abstract: In [arXiv:1906.10100], the authors argued that the Newman-Janis algorithm on the space of classical solutions in general relativity and electromagnetism could be used in the space of scattering amplitudes to map an amplitude with external scalar states to an amplitude associated to the scattering of "infinite spin particles". The minimal coupling of these particles to the gravitational or Maxwell field is equivalent to the classical coupling of the Kerr black hole with linearized gravity or the so-called $\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ charged state with the electromagnetic field. The action of the Newman-Janis mapping on scattering amplitudes was then used to compute the linear impulse at first post-Minkowskian (1PM) order, via the Kosower, Maybee, O'Connell (KMOC) formalism. In this paper, we continue with the idea of using the Newman-Janis mapping on the space of scalar QED amplitudes to compute classical observables such as the radiative gauge field and the angular impulse. We show that for tree-level amplitudes, the Newman-Janis action can be reinterpreted as a dressing of the photon propagator. This turns out to be an efficient way to compute these classical observables. Along the way, we highlight a subtlety that arises in proving the conservation of angular momentum for scalar -$\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Efficient prescription to search for linear gravitational wave memory from hyperbolic black hole encounters and its application to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset</title>

Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose $95\%$ upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is magical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic, which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the non-flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic is approximately equal to the rate of change of the minimal surface area in response to the change of cosmic brane tension in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity of the Heisenberg algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK) in which the Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton gravity theory that generates this metric as a solution.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in the Dark?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

Abstract: Configurations of masses located at the vertices of Platonic solids deep within the bulk of de Sitter spacetime generate deformations of the cosmological horizon with the geometry dual to these polyhedra. The horizon data encodes both the symmetries and sizes of the solids in the bulk.</description>
