      <title>ChatGPT and Corporate Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create a firm-level ChatGPT investment score, based on conference calls, that measures managers' anticipated changes in capital expenditures. We validate the score with interpretable textual content and its strong correlation with CFO survey responses. The investment score predicts future capital expenditure for up to nine quarters, controlling for Tobin's $q$ and other determinants, implying the investment score provides incremental information about firms' future investment opportunities. The investment score also separately forecasts future total, intangible, and R\&amp;D investments. Consistent with theoretical predictions, high-investment-score firms experience significant positive short-term returns upon disclosure, and negative long-run future abnormal returns. We demonstrate ChatGPT's applicability to measure other policies, such as dividends and employment.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning for financial data predictions: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Literature highlighted that financial time series data pose significant challenges for accurate stock price prediction, because these data are characterized by noise and susceptibility to news; traditional statistical methodologies made assumptions, such as linearity and normality, which are not suitable for the non-linear nature of financial time series; on the other hand, machine learning methodologies are able to capture non linear relationship in the data. To date, neural network is considered the main machine learning tool for the financial prices prediction. Transfer Learning, as a method aimed at transferring knowledge from source tasks to target tasks, can represent a very useful methodological tool for getting better financial prediction capability. Current reviews on the above body of knowledge are mainly focused on neural network architectures, for financial prediction, with very little emphasis on the transfer learning methodology; thus, this paper is aimed at going deeper on this topic by developing a systematic review with respect to application of Transfer Learning for financial market predictions and to challenges/potential future directions of the transfer learning methodologies for stock market predictions.</description>
