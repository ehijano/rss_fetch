      <title>AI Propaganda factories with language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters. Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor: when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors. Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these operations also provides a detection signature.</description>

      <title>FlowMalTrans: Unsupervised Binary Code Translation for Malware Detection Using Flow-Adapter Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.</description>

      <title>Robustness Assessment and Enhancement of Text Watermarking for Google's SynthID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text. Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels, enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning. Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at: https://github.com/githshine/SynGuard.</description>

      <title>Network-Level Prompt and Trait Leakage in Local Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit $70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over 73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Operational Cybersecurity and Supply Chain Threat Landscape when Developing and Deploying AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.</description>

      <title>MindGuard: Tracking, Detecting, and Attributing MCP Tool Poisoning Attack via Decision Dependence Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor.
  Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Large Models in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets. This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization. These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images. We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a valuable reference for the field's development.</description>

      <title>Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.</description>

      <title>Ransomware 3.0: Self-Composing and LLM-Orchestrated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using automated reasoning, code synthesis, and contextual decision-making, we introduce a new threat that exploits large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle. Ransomware 3.0 represents the first threat model and research prototype of LLM-orchestrated ransomware. Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only requires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is synthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants that adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance, payload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack campaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal, enterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that measures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase. We show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and sustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments. Finally, we present behavioral signals and multi-level telemetry of Ransomware 3.0 through a case study to motivate future development of better defenses and policy enforcements to address novel AI-enabled ransomware attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience for IoE: A Perspective of Networking-Level Safeguard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Energy (IoE) integrates IoT-driven digital communication with power grids to enable efficient and sustainable energy systems. Still, its interconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber threats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional safeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety consequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level safeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based safeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node representations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently. Through a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a security dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative methods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against evolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the resilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing critical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose future research directions in this novel research area.</description>

      <title>BridgeShield: Enhancing Security for Cross-chain Bridge Applications via Heterogeneous Graph Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield, a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin as an Interplanetary Monetary Standard with Proof-of-Transit Timestamping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of deploying Bitcoin as the shared monetary standard between Earth and Mars, accounting for physical constraints of interplanetary communication. We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit Timestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for Bitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO) mesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication, long-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure settlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit chains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it measurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin consensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations for local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted) provide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while Mars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged assets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon regimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to administrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring.</description>

      <title>CyberSleuth: Autonomous Blue-Team LLM Agent for Web Attack Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powerful tools for automating complex tasks. In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in red-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests. Defensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively less attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic study of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web application attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes packet-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the exploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences of core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture - and provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent architectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing complexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a separate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the exact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts, which rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They also expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source LLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our benchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible evaluation of forensic agents.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Penetration Testing AI for the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%) and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10 findings are under CVE review.</description>

      <title>JADES: A Universal Framework for Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations, providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Publish to Perish: Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Assisted Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into the scientific peer-review process, raising new questions about their reliability and resilience to manipulation. In this work, we investigate the potential for hidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations -- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that adversely affect a "honest-but-lazy" reviewer. Finally, we propose and empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under automated content checks.</description>

      <title>AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability, adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models, show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++ codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\% success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.</description>

      <title>PromptSleuth: Detecting Prompt Injection via Semantic Intent Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, from virtual assistants to autonomous agents. However, their flexibility also introduces new attack vectors-particularly Prompt Injection (PI), where adversaries manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs. As attackers continuously evolve with paraphrased, obfuscated, and even multi-task injection strategies, existing benchmarks are no longer sufficient to capture the full spectrum of emerging threats.
  To address this gap, we construct a new benchmark that systematically extends prior efforts. Our benchmark subsumes the two widely-used existing ones while introducing new manipulation techniques and multi-task scenarios, thereby providing a more comprehensive evaluation setting. We find that existing defenses, though effective on their original benchmarks, show clear weaknesses under our benchmark, underscoring the need for more robust solutions. Our key insight is that while attack forms may vary, the adversary's intent-injecting an unauthorized task-remains invariant. Building on this observation, we propose PromptSleuth, a semantic-oriented defense framework that detects prompt injection by reasoning over task-level intent rather than surface features. Evaluated across state-of-the-art benchmarks, PromptSleuth consistently outperforms existing defense while maintaining comparable runtime and cost efficiency. These results demonstrate that intent-based semantic reasoning offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable strategy for defending LLMs against evolving prompt injection threats.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</description>

      <title>Guarding Against Malicious Biased Threats (GAMBiT) Experiments: Revealing Cognitive Bias in Human-Subjects Red-Team Cyber Range Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three large-scale human-subjects red-team cyber range datasets from the Guarding Against Malicious Biased Threats (GAMBiT) project. Across Experiments 1-3 (July 2024-March 2025), 19-20 skilled attackers per experiment conducted two 8-hour days of self-paced operations in a simulated enterprise network (SimSpace Cyber Force Platform) while we captured multi-modal data: self-reports (background, demographics, psychometrics), operational notes, terminal histories, keylogs, network packet captures (PCAP), and NIDS alerts (Suricata). Each participant began from a standardized Kali Linux VM and pursued realistic objectives (e.g., target discovery and data exfiltration) under controlled constraints. Derivative curated logs and labels are included. The combined release supports research on attacker behavior modeling, bias-aware analytics, and method benchmarking. Data are available via IEEE Dataport entries for Experiments 1-3.</description>

      <title>Governable AI: Provable Safety Under Extreme Threat Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible, and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaborative Bot Detection in MMORPGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups, effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Privacy Risks of Split Inference: A GAN-Based Data Reconstruction Attack via Progressive Feature Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy. However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors, limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios, out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.</description>

      <title>Microarchitecture Design and Benchmarking of Custom SHA-3 Instruction for RISC-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements. However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations, often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3 permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization, and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5 simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09% increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations for future cryptographic instruction set extensions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic method to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\pi(s)$ for each service. This allows us to iteratively compute a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive control (SSH 22, RDP 3389) gets higher $\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.</description>

      <title>Maven-Hijack: Software Supply Chain Attack Exploiting Packaging Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Java projects frequently rely on package managers such as Maven to manage complex webs of external dependencies. While these tools streamline development, they also introduce subtle risks to the software supply chain. In this paper, we present Maven-Hijack, a novel attack that exploits the order in which Maven packages dependencies and the way the Java Virtual Machine resolves classes at runtime. By injecting a malicious class with the same fully qualified name as a legitimate one into a dependency that is packaged earlier, an attacker can silently override core application behavior without modifying the main codebase or library names. We demonstrate the real-world feasibility of this attack by compromising the Corona-Warn-App, a widely used open-source COVID-19 contact tracing system, and gaining control over its database connection logic. We evaluate three mitigation strategies, such as sealed JARs, Java Modules, and the Maven Enforcer plugin. Our results show that, while Java Modules offer strong protection, the Maven Enforcer plugin with duplicate class detection provides the most practical and effective defense for current Java projects. These findings highlight the urgent need for improved safeguards in Java's build and dependency management processes to prevent stealthy supply chain attacks.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security.
  In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</description>

      <title>RevPRAG: Revealing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through LLM Activation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</description>

Abstract: Distributed Key Generation (DKG) is vital to threshold-based cryptographic protocols such as threshold signatures, secure multiparty computation, and i-voting. Yet, standard $(n,t)$-DKG requires a known set of $n$ participants and a fixed threshold $t$, making it impractical for public or decentralized settings where membership and availability can change.
  We introduce Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG), which relaxes these constraints by allowing each participant to select its own guardian set, with a local threshold to reconstruct that participant's partial key. FDKG generalizes DKG and draws inspiration from Federated Byzantine Agreement, enabling dynamic trust delegation with minimal message complexity (two rounds). The protocol's liveness can tolerate adversary that controls up to $k - t + 1$ nodes in every guardian set. The paper presents a detailed protocol, a formal description of liveness, privacy, and integrity properties, and a simulation-based evaluation showcasing the efficacy of FDKG in mitigating node unreliability.
  In a setting of 100 parties, a 50% participation rate, 80% retention, and 40 guardians, the distribution phase incurred a total message size of 332.7 kB ($O(n\,k)$), and reconstruction phase 416.56 kB ($O(n\,k)$. Groth16 client-side proving took about 5 s in the distribution phase and ranged from 0.619 s up to 29.619 s in the reconstruction phase.
  Our work advances distributed cryptography by enabling flexible trust models for dynamic networks, with applications ranging from ad-hoc collaboration to blockchain governance.</description>

      <title>ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the observation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse queries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this query diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage grows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989</link>

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</description>

      <title>A Time Series Analysis of Malware Uploads to Programming Language Ecosystems</title>

Abstract: Software ecosystems built around programming languages have greatly facilitated software development. At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Detection of Fake Identity Documents: Methodology, Benchmark, and Improved Algorithms (FakeIDet2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11716</link>

Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Physical Layer Security Protocols for Next-Generation Communication Networks (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal verification is crucial for ensuring the robustness of security protocols against adversarial attacks. The Needham-Schroeder protocol, a foundational authentication mechanism, has been extensively studied, including its integration with Physical Layer Security (PLS) techniques such as watermarking and jamming. Recent research has used ProVerif to verify these mechanisms in terms of secrecy. However, the ProVerif-based approach limits the ability to improve understanding of security beyond verification results. To overcome these limitations, we re-model the same protocol using an Isabelle formalism that generates sound animation, enabling interactive and automated formal verification of security protocols. Our modelling and verification framework is generic and highly configurable, supporting both cryptography and PLS. For the same protocol, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis (secrecy and authenticity in four different eavesdropper locations under both passive and active attacks) using our new web interface. Our findings not only successfully reproduce and reinforce previous results on secrecy but also reveal an uncommon but expected outcome: authenticity is preserved across all examined scenarios, even in cases where secrecy is compromised. We have proposed a PLS-based Diffie-Hellman protocol that integrates watermarking and jamming, and our analysis shows that it is secure for deriving a session key with required authentication. These highlight the advantages of our novel approach, demonstrating its robustness in formally verifying security properties beyond conventional methods.</description>

      <title>When Memory Becomes a Vulnerability: Towards Multi-turn Jailbreak Attacks against Text-to-Image Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern text-to-image (T2I) generation systems (e.g., DALL$\cdot$E 3) exploit the memory mechanism, which captures key information in multi-turn interactions for faithful generation. Despite its practicality, the security analyses of this mechanism have fallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that it can exacerbate the risk of jailbreak attacks. Previous attacks fuse the unsafe target prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily detected or lead to the generation of non-unsafe images due to under- or over-detoxification. In contrast, we propose embedding the malice at the inception of the chat session in memory, addressing the above limitations.
  Specifically, we propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against real-world text-to-image generation systems that explicitly exploits their memory mechanisms. Inception is composed of two key modules: segmentation and recursion. We introduce Segmentation, a semantic-preserving method that generates multi-round prompts. By leveraging NLP analysis techniques, we design policies to decompose a prompt, together with its malicious intent, according to sentence structure, thereby evading safety filters. Recursion further addresses the challenge posed by unsafe sub-prompts that cannot be separated through simple segmentation. It firstly expands the sub-prompt, then invokes segmentation recursively. To facilitate multi-turn adversarial prompts crafting, we build VisionFlow, an emulation T2I system that integrates two-stage safety filters and industrial-grade memory mechanisms. The experiment results show that Inception successfully allures unsafe image generation, surpassing the SOTA by a 20.0\% margin in attack success rate. We also conduct experiments on the real-world commercial T2I generation platforms, further validating the threats of Inception in practice.</description>
