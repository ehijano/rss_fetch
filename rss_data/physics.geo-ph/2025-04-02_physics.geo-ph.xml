      <title>Joint gravity survey using an absolute atom gravimeter and relative gravimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying gravity field survey is one of the important methods for seismic risk assessment. To obtain accurate timevarying gravity data, it is essential to establish a gravity reference, which can be achieved using absolute gravimeters. Atom gravimeters, as a recently emerging type of absolute gravimeter, have not yet been practically validated for their reliability in mobile gravity surveys. To study and evaluate the operational status and performance metrics of the A-Grav atom gravimeter under complex field conditions, the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei National Laboratory, and the Anhui Earthquake Agency conducted a joint observation experiment using an atom gravimeter (AGrav) and relative gravimeters (CG-6) within the North China Seismic Gravity Monitoring Network. The experiment yielded the following results: 1) The standard deviations for mobile observations of the atom gravimeter is 2.1 {\mu}Gal; 2)The mean differences in point values and segment differences between the atom gravimeter and the relative gravimeter at the same locations is 5.8(17.1) {\mu}Gal and 4.4(11.0) {\mu}Gal, respectively, with point value differences of less than 2.0 {\mu}Gal compared to the FG5X absolute gravimeter at the same location; 3) The results of hybrid gravity adjustment based on absolute gravity control and the point value precision at each measurement point, with an average point value precision of 3.6 {\mu}Gal. The results indicate that the A-Grav atom gravimeter has observation accuracy and precision comparable to the FG5X absolute gravimeter, demonstrating good stability and reliability in field mobile measurements, and can meet the requirements for seismic gravity monitoring. This work provides a technical reference for the practical application of atom gravimeters in control measurements and time-varying gravity monitoring for earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of stress in the cohesive zone, dissipation and fracture energy during shear rupture experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse high resolution slip rate data obtained during dynamic shear rupture experiments by Berman et al. (2020). We use an inverse method to extract the details of strength evolution within the cohesive zone. The overall behaviour is slip-weakening at high rupture speeds ($&gt;0.76C_\mathrm{R}$, where $C_\mathrm{R}$ is the Rayleigh wavespeed), but non-monotonic at low rupture speeds ($&lt;0.76C_\mathrm{R}$), with a transient increase after an initial strong weakening. The slower ruptures are associated to more weakening in the cohesive zone. The fraction of breakdown work associated to the initial weakening, immediately behind the rupture tip, matches the fracture energy estimated by independent methods, but the total breakdown work can be much larger than fracture energy. Complex stress evolution in the cohesive zone is compatible with a well-defined fracture energy that explains rupture tip propagation, but the complexity is reflected in local slip rates that will impact radiated waves.</description>

      <title>SVInvNet: A Densely Connected Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Seismic Velocity Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning-based approach to seismic velocity inversion problem, focusing on both noisy and noiseless training datasets of varying sizes. Our Seismic Velocity Inversion Network (SVInvNet) introduces a novel architecture that contains a multi-connection encoder-decoder structure enhanced with dense blocks. This design is specifically tuned to effectively process time series data, which is essential for addressing the challenges of non-linear seismic velocity inversion. For training and testing, we created diverse seismic velocity models, including multi-layered, faulty, and salt dome categories. We also investigated how different kinds of ambient noise, both coherent and stochastic, and the size of the training dataset affect learning outcomes. SVInvNet is trained on datasets ranging from 750 to 6,000 samples and is tested using a large benchmark dataset of 12,000 samples. Despite its fewer parameters compared to the baseline model, SVInvNet achieves superior performance with this dataset. The performance of SVInvNet was further evaluated using the OpenFWI dataset and Marmousi-derived velocity models. The comparative analysis clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Development of portable cosmic-ray muon detector array for muography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the multidisciplinary applications of cosmic-ray muons expand to large-scale and wide-area scenarios, the construction of cosmic-ray muon detector arrays has become a key solution to overcome the hardware limitations of individual detector. For muography, the array-based detector design enables fast-scanning of large target objects, allowing for rapid identification of density variation regions, which can improve the efficiency of tomography. This paper integrates scintillator detector technology with Internet of things (IoT) technology, proposing a novel array networking model for nationwide deployment. The model enables long-distance data collection and distribution, laying the foundation for future multidisciplinary applications such as muography and other fields.</description>
