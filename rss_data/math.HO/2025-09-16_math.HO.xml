      <title>Cycling Along Euler Road</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $P_{\lambda}$ points, which canonically parametrize points on the Euler line. This allows us to show that the Euler line of any inscribed $n$-polytope in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space arises from the Euler lines of its facets, beginning from the Euler line of a point in the plane. Furthermore, we situate $P_{\lambda}$ points in the literature of modern triangle centers.</description>

      <title>Bluffing in Scrabble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that in games with imperfect information, such as poker, bluffing with some probability can be a component of the optimal strategy. However, as far as we know, nobody has ever exhibited a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy involves bluffing, or even a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy is a mixed (i.e., randomized) strategy. We present a carefully constructed Scrabble position, that could actually arise in a tournament game with no invalid words played, in which the optimal strategy (assuming that a tied score leads to the point being split equally, with no recourse to so-called "spread points" as a tie-breaking mechanism) is to make Move A with probability 1/3 and to make Move B with probability 2/3. Move B can reasonably be called a bluff, in the sense that it sets up a threat which the player cannot in fact execute, but which the opponent may not be able to rule out.</description>

      <title>Indigenous Beadwork as a Method of Teaching Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the authors describe efforts aimed at Indigenizing a second-year linear algebra course at a small liberal arts university in Manitoba, Canada. This is done through an assignment, part hands-on and part written work, that explores the connection between Indigenous beadwork and linear algebra. Our collaboration was perhaps unconventional: Sarah, the first author, is a mathematics professor; while Cathy, the second author, is an associate professor in art history. However, we both had similar goals of putting theory into practice and making positive changes to student learning outcomes in a culturally appropriate way. We situate our work in the context of the current scholarly literature, adding to the important ongoing dialogue on Indigenization of course content and reflecting on the process and outcomes. This transformation of the course curriculum represented an applied approach to immerse Indigenous knowledge and pedagogy into a mathematics classroom. We hope that it may serve as an example of how other educators, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), can integrate Indigenous knowledge-centered pedagogy into their classroom.</description>

      <title>Journey of Lars Ahlfors' Fields Medal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944, pawned in Sweden during World War II, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. This article is based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and established biographical sources.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approach in physics exercises of mathematics education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. Students and teachers familiar with elementary probability theory and mechanics may find these exercises useful for understanding some basic concepts of stochastic mechanics.</description>
