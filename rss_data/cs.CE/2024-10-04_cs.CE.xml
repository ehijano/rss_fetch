      <title>FLAG: Financial Long Document Classification via AMR-based GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.</description>

      <title>MIGA: Mixture-of-Experts with Group Aggregation for Stock Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock market prediction has remained an extremely challenging problem for many decades owing to its inherent high volatility and low information noisy ratio. Existing solutions based on machine learning or deep learning demonstrate superior performance by employing a single model trained on the entire stock dataset to generate predictions across all types of stocks. However, due to the significant variations in stock styles and market trends, a single end-to-end model struggles to fully capture the differences in these stylized stock features, leading to relatively inaccurate predictions for all types of stocks. In this paper, we present MIGA, a novel Mixture of Expert with Group Aggregation framework designed to generate specialized predictions for stocks with different styles by dynamically switching between distinct style experts. To promote collaboration among different experts in MIGA, we propose a novel inner group attention architecture, enabling experts within the same group to share information and thereby enhancing the overall performance of all experts. As a result, MIGA significantly outperforms other end-to-end models on three Chinese Stock Index benchmarks including CSI300, CSI500, and CSI1000. Notably, MIGA-Conv reaches 24 % excess annual return on CSI300 benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model by 8% absolute. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mixture of experts for stock market prediction, providing valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Fast Crystal Tensor Property Prediction: A General O(3)-Equivariant Framework Based on Polar Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the tensor properties of crystalline materials is a fundamental task in materials science. Unlike single-value property prediction, which is inherently invariant, tensor property prediction requires maintaining $O(3)$ group tensor equivariance. This equivariance constraint often introduces tremendous computational costs, necessitating specialized designs for effective and efficient predictions. To address this limitation, we propose a general $O(3)$-equivariant framework for fast crystal tensor property prediction, called GoeCTP. Our framework is efficient as it does not need to impose equivalence constraints onto the network architecture. Instead, GoeCTP captures the tensor equivariance with a simple external rotation and reflection (R&amp;R) module based on polar decomposition. The crafted external R&amp;R module can rotate and reflect the crystal into an invariant standardized crystal position in space without introducing extra computational cost. We show that GoeCTP is general as it is a plug-and-play module that can be smoothly integrated with any existing single-value property prediction framework for predicting tensor properties. Experimental results indicate that GoeCTP achieves higher prediction performance and runs 13$\times$ faster compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in elastic benchmarking datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Designing Mechanical Meta-Materials by Learning Equivariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical meta-materials are solids whose geometric structure results in exotic nonlinear behaviors that are not typically achievable via homogeneous materials. We show how to drastically expand the design space of a class of mechanical meta-materials known as cellular solids, by generalizing beyond translational symmetry. This is made possible by transforming a reference geometry according to a divergence free flow that is parameterized by a neural network and equivariant under the relevant symmetry group. We show how to construct flows equivariant to the space groups, despite the fact that these groups are not compact. Coupling this flow with a differentiable nonlinear mechanics simulator allows us to represent a much richer set of cellular solids than was previously possible. These materials can be optimized to exhibit desirable mechanical properties such as negative Poisson's ratios or to match target stress-strain curves. We validate these new designs in simulation and by fabricating real-world prototypes. We find that designs with higher-order symmetries can exhibit a wider range of behaviors.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Alternatives of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores alternative formulations of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) as a foundation for neural network design. The original KST formulation, while mathematically elegant, presents practical challenges due to its limited insight into the structure of inner and outer functions and the large number of unknown variables it introduces. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) leverage KST for function approximation, but they have faced scrutiny due to mixed results compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and practical limitations imposed by the original KST formulation. To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes many of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches. These results present ActNet as a promising new direction for KST-based deep learning applications, particularly in scientific computing and PDE simulation tasks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Point-of-Interest Recommendation: Models, Architectures, and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Inference Frame for SMLM (Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) surpasses the diffraction limit, achieving subcellular resolution. Traditional SMLM analysis methods often rely on point spread function (PSF) model fitting, limiting the application of complex PSF models. In recent years, deep learning approaches have significantly improved SMLM algorithms, yielding promising results. However, limitations in inference speed and model size have restricted the widespread adoption of deep learning in practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient model deployment framework and introduces a lightweight neural network, DilatedLoc, aimed at enhancing both image reconstruction quality and inference speed. Compared to leading network models, DilatedLoc reduces network parameters to under 100 MB and achieves a 50% improvement in inference speed, with superior GPU utilization through a novel deployment architecture compatible with various network models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for predicting the dynamic performance of suspension systems in multi-axle vehicles, emphasizing the integration of machine learning with traditional vehicle dynamics modeling. A Multi-Task Deep Belief Network Deep Neural Network (MTL-DBN-DNN) was developed to capture the relationships between key vehicle parameters and suspension performance metrics. The model was trained on data generated from numerical simulations and demonstrated superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional DNN models. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of various vehicle and suspension parameters on dynamic suspension performance. Additionally, the Suspension Dynamic Performance Index (SDPI) was introduced as a holistic measure to quantify overall suspension performance, accounting for the combined effects of multiple parameters. The findings highlight the effectiveness of multitask learning in improving predictive models for complex vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimal control for delay differential equations: A simultaneous approach based on linearization of the delayed state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry, and they must be accounted for when designing control strategies. However, numerical optimal control (NOC) of delay differential equations (DDEs) is challenging because it requires specialized discretization methods and the time delays may depend on the manipulated inputs or state variables. Therefore, in this work, we propose to linearize the delayed states around the current time. This results in a set of implicit differential equations, and we compare the steady states and the corresponding stability criteria of the DDEs and the approximate system. Furthermore, we propose a simultaneous approach for NOC of DDEs based on the linearization, and we discretize the approximate system using Euler's implicit method. Finally, we present a numerical example involving a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Cracking the code: Lessons from 15 years of digital health IPOs for the era of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: As digital health evolves, identifying factors that drive success is crucial. This study examines how reimbursement billing codes affect the long-term financial performance of digital health companies on U.S. stock markets, addressing the question: What separates the winners from the rest?
  Methods: We analyzed digital health companies that went public on U.S. stock exchanges between 2010 and 2021, offering products or services aimed at improving personal health or disease management within the U.S. market. A search using Google and existing IPO lists identified eligible companies. They were categorized based on the presence or absence of billing codes at the time of their initial public offering (IPO). Key performance indicators, including Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), relative performance to benchmark indices, and market capitalization change, were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's Exact tests.
  Results: Of the 33 companies analyzed, 15 (45.5%) had billing codes at IPO. The median IPO price was $17.00, with no significant difference between groups. Those with billing codes were 25.5 times more likely to achieve a positive CAGR. Their median market capitalization increased 56.3%, compared to a median decline of 80.1% for those without billing codes. All five top performers, in terms of CAGR, had billing codes at IPO, whereas nine of the ten worst performers lacked them. Companies without billing codes were 16 times more likely to experience a drop in market capitalization by the study's end.
  Conclusion: Founders, investors, developers and analysts may have overestimated consumers' willingness to pay out-of-pocket or underestimated reimbursement complexities. As the sector evolves, especially with AI-driven solutions, stakeholders should prioritize billing codes to ensure sustainable growth, financial stability, and maximized investor returns.</description>

      <title>Custom Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance in Indoor and Outdoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous systems to perform trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in real-time. While many control strategies have effectively utilized linear approximations, addressing the non-linear dynamics of UAV, especially in obstacle-dense environments, remains a key challenge that requires further research. This paper introduces a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for the DJI Matrice 100, addressing these challenges by using a dynamic model and B-spline interpolation for smooth reference trajectories, ensuring minimal deviation while respecting safety constraints. The framework supports various trajectory types and employs a penalty-based cost function for control accuracy in tight maneuvers. The framework utilizes CasADi for efficient real-time optimization, enabling the UAV to maintain robust operation even under tight computational constraints. Simulation and real-world indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated the NMPC ability to adapt to disturbances, resulting in smooth, collision-free navigation.</description>

      <title>Sequential infinite-dimensional Bayesian optimal experimental design with derivative-informed latent attention neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new computational framework to solve sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design (SBOED) problems constrained by large-scale partial differential equations with infinite-dimensional random parameters. We propose an adaptive terminal formulation of the optimality criteria for SBOED to achieve adaptive global optimality. We also establish an equivalent optimization formulation to achieve computational simplicity enabled by Laplace and low-rank approximations of the posterior. To accelerate the solution of the SBOED problem, we develop a derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO), a new neural network surrogate model that leverages (1) derivative-informed dimension reduction for latent encoding, (2) an attention mechanism to capture the dynamics in the latent space, (3) an efficient training in the latent space augmented by projected Jacobian, which collectively leads to an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate in computing not only the parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps but also their Jacobians. We further develop the formulation for the computation of the MAP points, the eigenpairs, and the sampling from posterior by LANO in the reduced spaces and use these computations to solve the SBOED problem. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of LANO compared to two other neural architectures and the high accuracy of LANO compared to the finite element method (FEM) for the computation of MAP points and eigenvalues in solving the SBOED problem with application to the experimental design of the time to take MRI images in monitoring tumor growth. We show that the proposed computational framework achieves an amortized $180\times$ speedup.</description>

      <title>The eBPF Runtime in the Linux Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) is a runtime that enables users to load programs into the operating system (OS) kernel, like Linux or Windows, and execute them safely and efficiently at designated kernel hooks. Each program passes through a verifier that reasons about the safety guarantees for execution. Hosting a safe virtual machine runtime within the kernel makes it dynamically programmable. Unlike the popular approach of bypassing or completely replacing the kernel, eBPF gives users the flexibility to modify the kernel on the fly, rapidly experiment and iterate, and deploy solutions to achieve their workload-specific needs, while working in concert with the kernel.
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the eBPF runtime in the Linux kernel. We argue that eBPF today provides a mature and safe programming environment for the kernel. It has seen wide adoption since its inception and is increasingly being used not just to extend, but program entire components of the kernel, while preserving its runtime integrity. We outline the compelling advantages it offers for real-world production usage, and illustrate current use cases. Finally, we identify its key challenges, and discuss possible future directions.</description>
