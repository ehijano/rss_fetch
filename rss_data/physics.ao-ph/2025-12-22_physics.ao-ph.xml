      <title>Effects of the Coriolis force on the coherent structures in conventionally neutral atmospheric boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Coriolis force due to Earth's rotation can induce wind veer in the mean flow velocity of an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), but much less is known about its effects on turbulent coherent structures. In this work, large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed to investigate the effects of the Coriolis force on the characteristics of turbulent coherent structures in the conventionally neutral atmospheric boundary layers (CNBL). Variation of the Coriolis force is realized by changing latitude or geostrophic wind speed.We found that the Coriolis force causes distinct deflection of coherent velocity structures to the geostrophic wind direction, which is not aligned with the direction of either the mean wind or the mean shear. By plotting against the difference between the local wind veer angle and the global cross-isobaric angle, the structure deflection angle under different conditions can be well collapsed, indicating a possible universal relationship. Moreover, we also studied the effect of the Coriolis force on the inclination angle of large-scale turbulent structures. It is found that as latitude decreases or geostrophic wind speed increases, the inclination angle in the surface layer increases, probably due to the deflection of turbulent structures caused by the Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Latent Space reveals changing dynamics of European heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to climate change, heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, with western Europe experiencing the strongest trends in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. Part of the temperature trends are caused by circulation changes, which are not accurately captured in climate models. Here we deploy Deep Learning techniques to classify European heatwaves based on their atmospheric circulation and to study their associated changes over time. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the heatwave samples, after which we cluster them on their extraced features. The VAE is trained on large ensemble climate model simulations and we show that the VAE generalizes well to observed heatwave circulations in ERA5 reanalysis, without the need for transfer learning. The circulation features relevant for heatwaves in ERA5 are consistent with the climate model heatwaves. Regression analysis reveals that the Atlantic Plume type of heatwaves are becoming more frequent over time, while the Atlantic High heatwaves are becoming less frequent. We introduce new and straightforward interpretability methods to study the latent space, including feature importance identification and changes over time. We investigate which circulation features are associated with the most important nodes in the latent space and how the latent space changes over time. For example, we find that the Atlantic Low heatwave shows a deepening of the low pressure system off the Atlantic coast over time. Each heatwave type is undergoing unique changes in their circulation, highlighting the necessity to study each heatwave type separately. Our method can furthermore be used to boost specific aspects of extreme events, and we illustrate how heatwave circulation could change in the future if the current trends persist, with in some cases an intensification of features.</description>

      <title>On early-warning of full versus partial Atlantic overturning circulation collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models indicate a possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) even for moderate climate change scenarios. There is considerable uncertainty in its likelihood for a given scenario and the critical global warming threshold. An alternative are early-warning signals (EWS) in AMOC fingerprints, which leverage generic statistical properties before destabilization of a steady state (a saddle-node bifurcation). But an AMOC collapse may be a sequence of partial collapses with shutdown of deep water formation in distinct regions.
  A conceptual model is presented featuring a sequential shutdown in two deep water formation regions. Multiple tipping points are present that do not follow the saddle-node normal form. As a result, the choice of the observable used to monitor EWS dramatically influences the prediction of the collapse via EWS. Various trends in EWS for different observables make it hard to determine what type of collapse (partial or full) will follow.</description>

      <title>Am I Confused or Is This Confusing?: Deep Ensembles for ENSO Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful uncertainty quantification (UQ) is paramount in high stakes climate prediction. Deep ensembles, or ensembles of probabilistic neural networks, are state of the art for UQ in machine learning (ML) and are growing increasingly popular for weather and climate prediction. However, detailed analyses of the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of ensembles in these complex problem settings are lacking. We take a step towards filling this gap by deploying deep ensembles for predictability analysis of the El-Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Community Earth System Model 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE). Principally, we show that epistemic uncertainty, modeled by ensemble disagreement, robustly signals predictive error growth associated with shifts in the distributions of monthly sea-surface temperature (SST), ocean heat content (OHC), and zonal surface wind stress ($\tau_x$) anomalies under a climate change scenario. Conversely, we find that aleatoric uncertainty, which remains a popular measure of model confidence, becomes less reliable and behaves counterintuitively under climate-change-induced distributional shift. We highlight that, because ensemble performance improvement relative to the expected single model scales with epistemic uncertainty, ensemble improvement increases with distributional shift from climate change. This work demonstrates the utility of deep ensembles for modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ML climate prediction, as well as the growing importance of robustly quantifying these two forms of uncertainty under anthropogenic warming.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Pre-Satellite Tropical Cyclogenesis Climatology Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable tropical cyclone (TC) climatology is the key to assessing historical and future changes in TC activities. While global TC records have been systematically maintained since the early 1940s, substantial uncertainties remain for the pre-satellite era during which TC observations relied mostly on scattered aircraft reconnaissance and sporadic ship reports. This study presents a deep learning (DL) approach to reconstruct historical TC activity in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin, with a main focus on the pre-satellite era. Using data feature enrichment tailored for tropical cyclogenesis (TCG), we demonstrate that DL can effectively capture the main characteristics and changes in TCG climatology during the post-satellite era. With additional cross-validations, the reconstruction of TCG climatology is then extended to a pre-satellite period (1940-1960) during which TC base-track datasets are most uncertain. Our DL reconstruction reveals a significant missing of TCG in the current best-track data between September and November during the pre-satellite era. Such a TCG undercount in the best track data occurs mainly around 10-15$^\circ$N in the central WNP, while coastal regions show better consistency with DL reconstruction. These findings not only highlight the potential of DL for improving historical assessments of TC activity, but also advance our understanding of TCG processes by identifying key environmental conditions conducive to TC formation. The DL approach presented herein can be applied to other ocean basins, climate proxies, or reanalysis datasets for future TC climate studies.</description>

      <title>When and where higher-resolution climate data improve impact model performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate impact assessments increasingly rely on high-resolution climate and forcing datasets, under the premise that finer detail enhances both the accuracy and policy relevance of projections. Yet systematic evaluations of when and where higher resolution actually improves impact model outcomes remain limited, and it is unclear whether increasing spatial resolution consistently enhances performance across sectors, regions, and forcing variables. Here we show that gains in climate input accuracy and impact model performance are largest when moving from coarse (60 km) to intermediate (10 km) resolution, while further refinement to 3 km and 1 km yields more modest and inconsistent benefits. Using cross-sectoral simulations from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, we find that higher resolution substantially improves model skill in temperature-sensitive impact models and topographically complex regions, whereas precipitation-driven and low-relief systems show weaker and less systematic improvements. For temperature, both climate inputs and model outputs improve most strongly at the 60 km to 10 km transition, with diminishing gains at finer scales; for precipitation, some models even exhibit reduced performance beyond 10 km. These results highlight that optimal resolution depends on sectoral and regional context, and point to the need for improving model process representation and downscaling techniques so that added spatial detail translates into meaningful skill gains. For data providers, this implies prioritizing resolutions that maximize improvements where they matter most, while for modelling groups and users it underscores the need for explicit benchmarking of resolution choices in climate impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Learning vertical coordinates via automatic differentiation of a dynamical core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrain-following coordinates in atmospheric models often imprint their grid structure onto the solution, particularly over steep topography, where distorted coordinate layers can generate spurious horizontal and vertical motion. Standard formulations, such as hybrid or SLEVE coordinates, mitigate these errors by using analytic decay functions controlled by heuristic scale parameters that are typically tuned by hand and fixed a priori. In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics. Using several standard tests, we demonstrate that these learned coordinates reduce the mean squared error by a factor of 1.4 to 2 in non-linear statistical benchmarks, and eliminate spurious vertical velocity striations over steep topography.</description>

      <title>Vertical velocities in quasigeostrophic laboratory vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we test the predictions of the {\omega}-Equation against laboratory experiments with direct measurements of the vertical velocity w. Our results are further completed through the use of theoretical models of oceanic vortices, with the aim of helping oceanographers in better quantifying regions of upwelling and downwelling in the ocean. Using a rotating table and density stratification, we investigate non-axisymmetric surface vortices. The predicted vertical velocities calculated from the {\omega}-Equation are relatively small (|w| ~ 20 {\mu}m/s) and primarily appear at the vortex edges, where the vorticity sign changes, acting to restore flow stratification. However, our estimates of w, obtained from the divergence of the horizontal velocity field measured by PIV, are five times larger. This discrepancy is further confirmed by direct particle tracking measurements, which indicate a magnitude of approximately 100 {\mu}m/s for w. To address this inconsistency, we incorporate dissipative terms into the {\omega}-Equation to assess the role of viscous diffusion in enhancing internal recirculation in the vortex and thus vertical velocity magnitude. This hypothesis is favorably tested on a Gaussian vortex model.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute -- An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>How to use score-based diffusion in earth system science: A satellite nowcasting example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is used for many earth science applications; however, traditional ML methods trained with squared errors often create blurry forecasts. Diffusion models are an emerging generative ML technique with the ability to produce sharper, more realistic images by learning the underlying data distribution. Diffusion models are becoming more prevalent, yet adapting them for earth science applications can be challenging because most articles focus on theoretical aspects of the approach, rather than making the method widely accessible. This work illustrates score-based diffusion models with a well-known problem in atmospheric science: cloud nowcasting (zero-to-three-hour forecast). After discussing the background and intuition of score-based diffusion models using examples from geostationary satellite infrared imagery, we experiment with three types of diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our results show that the diffusion models not only advect existing clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation. A case study qualitatively shows the preservation of high-resolution features longer into the forecast than a conventional U-Net. The best of the three diffusion models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion models, the conventional U-Net, and persistence. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box ensemble generation with skillful calibration. By explaining and exploring diffusion models for a common problem and ending with lessons learned from adapting diffusion models for our task, this work provides a starting point for the community to utilize diffusion models for a variety of earth science applications.</description>

      <title>PEAR: Equal Area Weather Forecasting on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the natural sciences, with weather forecasting emerging as a flagship AI4Science application where machine learning models can now rival and even surpass traditional numerical simulations. Following the success of the landmark models Pangu Weather and Graphcast, outperforming traditional numerical methods for global medium-range forecasting, many novel data-driven methods have emerged. A common limitation shared by many of these models is their reliance on an equiangular discretization of the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization (HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing unphysical biases. Motivated by a growing support for this grid in meteorology and climate sciences, we propose to perform weather forecasting with deep learning models which natively operate on the HEALPix grid. To this end, we introduce Pangu Equal ARea (PEAR), a transformer-based weather forecasting model which operates directly on HEALPix-features and outperforms the corresponding model on an equiangular grid without any computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, AI-based Weather Prediction models that rely on neural network architectures$\unicode{x2013}$Neural Weather Models (NeWMs)$\unicode{x2013}$have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)$\unicode{x2013}$among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities$\unicode{x2013}$are challenging to forecast, as extrema are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent postprocessing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>
