      <title>Quench dynamics of disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of three-dimensional disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the Bogoliubov-Huang-Meng approximation, we show that the combined effect of quenched interactions, disorder and excitations may modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system. The validity criterion of the developed approach is accurately established. By quenching the interaction strength, we reveal that the quantum depletion and the deformation condensate induced by disorder are enhanced in the asymptotic steady state compared to the corresponding equilibrium values. The time evolution of the condensate deformation is accompanied by damped oscillations with amplitudes strongly depend on the disorder correlation length and on the relative quadrupolar interaction.</description>

      <title>Is the cortical dynamics ergodic? A numerical study in partially symmetric networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical activity in-vivo displays relaxational time scales much longer than the membrane time constant of the neurons or the deactivation time of ionotropic synaptic conductances. The mechanisms responsible for such slow dynamics are not understood. Here, we show that slow dynamics naturally and robustly emerges in dynamically-balanced networks of spiking neurons. This requires only partial symmetry in the synaptic connectivity, a feature of local cortical networks observed in experiments. The symmetry generates an effective, excitatory self-coupling of the neurons that leads to long-lived fluctuations in the network activity, without destroying the dynamical balance. When the excitatory self-coupling is suitably strong, the same mechanism leads to multiple equilibrium states of the network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel dynamical regime of the collective activity in spiking networks, where the memory of the initial state persists for very long times and ergodicity is broken.</description>

      <title>Unveiling quantum criticality of disordered Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper models via typical fidelity susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localization transition and quantum criticality {in the ground state of the} disordered Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, where a quasiperiodic potential is hybridized with a disordered potential. In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization transition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate critical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While the staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value, Fibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This contrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural complexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with the sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy defined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the typical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the localization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent. We focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal finite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with the Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those of the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite differences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models with the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same correlation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems and are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>

      <title>Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum transport via the quantum Doob transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks. Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of localization phase transition in the non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driven dynamics of localization transitions in a non-Hermitian Disordered Aubry-Andr\'{e} (DAA) model are examined under both open boundary conditions (OBC) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Through an analysis of the static properties of observables, including the localization length ($\xi$), inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and energy gap ($\Delta E$), we found that the critical exponents examined under PBC are also applicable under OBC. The Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) for the driven dynamics in the non-Hermitian DAA systems is formulated and numerically verified for different local-to-local quench directions. The hybrid KZS (HKZS) in the overlapping critical region of non-Hermitian DAA and Anderson localization is proposed and numerically confirmed the validity across a local-to-skin quench direction. This study generalizes the application of the KZS to the dynamical localization transitions within systems featuring dual localization mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Foundation Neural-Networks Quantum States as a Unified Ansatz for Multiple Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in the presence of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</description>
