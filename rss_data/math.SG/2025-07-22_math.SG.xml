      <title>Seven Sphere Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-oriented contact manifolds quite generally describe classical dynamical systems. Quantization is achieved by suitably associating a Schr\"odinger equation to every path in the contact manifold. We quantize the standard contact seven sphere by treating it as a homogeneous space of the quaternionic unitary group in order to construct a contact analog of Fedosov's formal connection on symplectic spinor bundles. We show that requiring convergence of the formal connection naturally filters the symplectic spinor bundle and yields an exact flat connection on each corresponding subbundle. A key ingredient is a generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff mechanism to the quaternionic unitary group. The passage from formal to bona fide quantization determines unitary irreducible representations of the quaternionic unitary group, whose dimensions tend to infinity as the formal deformation parameter approaches its classical limit. This appearance of finite-dimensional representations is not surprising since the contact seven sphere is closed and physically describes generalized positions, momenta and time variables.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems from Poisson reductions of generalized Hamiltonian torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing that an integrable system with a symmetry group $K$ on a manifold $M$ descends to an integrable system on a dense open subset of the quotient Poisson space $M/K$. The higher dimensional phase space $M$ carries a bivector $P_M$ yielding a bracket on $C^\infty(M)$ such that $C^\infty(M)^K$ is a Poisson algebra. The unreduced system on $M$ is supposed to possess `action variables' that generate a proper, effective action of a group of the form $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$ and descend to action variables of the reduced system. In view of the form of the group and since $P_M$ could be a quasi-Poisson bivector, we say that we work with a generalized Hamiltonian torus action. The reduced systems are in general superintegrable owing to the large set of invariants of the proper Hamiltonian action of $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$. We present several examples and apply our construction for solving open problems regarding the integrability of systems obtained previously by reductions of master systems on doubles of compact Lie groups: the cotangent bundle, the Heisenberg double and the quasi-Poisson double. Furthermore, we offer numerous applications to integrable systems living on moduli spaces of flat connections, using the quasi-Poisson approach.</description>

      <title>A Multidimensional Birkhoff Theorem for Recurrent Lagrangian Submanifolds by a Tonelli Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a closed manifold $M$ and a time-periodic Tonelli Hamiltonian $H : \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times T^*M \to \mathbb{R}$ with flow $\phi_H$. Let $\mathcal{L} \subset T^*M$ be a Lagrangian submanifold Hamiltonianly isotopic to the zero section. We prove that if $\phi_H^n(\mathcal{L})$ admits convergent subsequences in both positive and negative times, in the Hausdorff topology and with control on the Liouville primitives, to two Lagrangian submanifolds, then $\mathcal{L}$ is a graph over the zero section $0_{T^*M}$ of $T^*M$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{L}$ is recurrent in both positive and negative times for the same type of convergence.</description>

      <title>Classification of locally standard torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An action of a torus T on a manifold M is locally standard if, at each point, the stabilizer is a sub-torus and the non-zero isotropy weights are a basis to its weight lattice. The quotient M/T is then a manifold-with-corners, decorated by a so-called unimodular labelling, which keeps track of the isotropy representations in M, and by a degree two cohomology class with coefficients in the integral lattice of the Lie algebra of T, which encodes the "twistedness" of M over M/T. We classify locally standard smooth actions of T, up to equivariant diffeomorphisms, in terms of triples (Q,lambda,c), where Q is a manifold-with-corners, lambda is a unimodular labelling, and c is a degree two cohomology class with coefficients in the integral lattice.</description>

      <title>Configurations of Lagrangian spheres in $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dehn--Seidel twists on configurations of Lagrangian spheres in symplectic $K3$ surfaces, using tools from Seiberg--Witten theory. In the case of $ADE$ configurations of Lagrangian spheres, we prove that a naturally associated representation of the generalised Braid group in the symplectic mapping class group is always faithful after abelianising, in a suitable sense. More generally, we prove that squared Dehn--Seidel twists on homologically-distinct Lagrangian spheres are algebraically independent in the abelianisation of the smoothly-trivial symplectic mapping class group, and deduce from this new infinite-generation results. Beyond symplectic $K3$ surfaces, we also establish analogues of these results at the level of the fundamental group of the space of symplectic forms.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin recursion on the mirror curve of $\mathbb{P}^1$ encodes all genus equivariant open Gromov-Witten invariants of $(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1)$. This result can be viewed as an all genus equivariant open mirror symmetry for $(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1)$.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Closed Categorical Enumerative Invariants: Circle-Action Formality Morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical enumerative invariants of a Calabi-Yau category, encoded as the partition function of the associated closed string field theory (SFT), conjecturally equal Gromov-Witten invariants when applied to Fukaya categories. Part of this theory is a formality $L_\infty$ morphism which depends on a splitting of the non-commutative Hodge filtration. Our main result is providing an open-closed formality morphism; the algebraic structures involved conjecturallygive a home to open-closed GW invariants. We explain how the open-closed morphism is an ingredient towards quantizing the large $N$ open SFT of an object of a Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <title>GeoHNNs: Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric. Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and generalizable models of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Graded supermanifolds and homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold which is, roughly speaking, a supermanifold equipped with a privileged atlas whose coordinates have certain (real) homogeneity degrees. This defines a sheaf of graded algebras on the supermanifold, which is an additional structure on the supermanifold. The main principle of this approach is that grading is ultimately related to homogeneity. But assigning consistently homogeneity degrees to coordinates is the same as fixing a certain global vector field, the weight vector field. This approach is simple and more general than most of the approaches to graded manifolds present in the literature. In particular, the homogeneity degrees can be arbitrary reals, and the corresponding category includes compact supermanifolds. We systematically study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroup, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, and other related concepts like double homogeneity. The main achievements in this framework are proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma and a homogeneous analog of the Darboux Theorem, which seem to be interesting even for purely even homogeneity manifolds.</description>
