      <title>Piloting Structure-Based Drug Design via Modality-Specific Optimal Schedule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is crucial for identifying bioactive molecules. Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10% improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.</description>

      <title>In Silico Prediction and Validation of LmGt Inhibitors Using QSAR and Molecular Docking Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania mexicana relies on Leishmania mexicana gluscose transporter (LmGT) receptors, which play an important role in glucose and ribose uptake at different stages of parasite's life cycle. Previous efforts to identify LmGT inhibitors have been primarily based on in vitro screening. However, this conventional method is limited by inefficiency, high cost, and lack of specificity which leaves a significant gap in the development of targeted therapeutic candidates for LmGT. This study employs computational techniques to address this gap by developing a quantitative structure analysis relationship model, utilizing a support vector machine classifier to identify novel LmGt inhibitor. The QSAR model achieved an accuracy of 0.81 in differentiating active compounds. Molecular docking further validated the identified inhibitors, revealing strong binding affinities with a top score of -9.46. The docking analysis showed that the inhibitors formed multiple hydrogen bonds and occupied the same binding pockets as Phase 3 drug candidate. The tested inhibitors were derived from natural sources, which suggest reduced side effects and improved biocompability. This combined approach demonstrates the power of computational models in accelerating drug discovery, with implication for more efficient and biocompatible therapies against Leishmania mexicana.</description>

      <title>LightNobel: Improving Sequence Length Limitation in Protein Structure Prediction Model via Adaptive Activation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges, particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g., sequence length &gt; 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing for proteins with long sequences.</description>

      <title>Causal knowledge graph analysis identifies adverse drug effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for organizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain largely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships focusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic semantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in knowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities that knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while enabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly marked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both encoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG (DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications, side-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated large-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we tested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease progression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach successfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while identifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects. Further validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that combining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly improves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical relevance of our novel findings. These results demonstrate that our methodology provides a generalizable, knowledge-driven framework for scalable causal inference.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching for Controllable Biological Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete-time flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis, non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence design.</description>

      <title>Empower Structure-Based Molecule Optimization with Gradient Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-Based molecule optimization (SBMO) aims to optimize molecules with both continuous coordinates and discrete types against protein targets. A promising direction is to exert gradient guidance on generative models given its remarkable success in images, but it is challenging to guide discrete data and risks inconsistencies between modalities. To this end, we leverage a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference, presenting Molecule Joint Optimization (MolJO), the gradient-based SBMO framework that facilitates joint guidance signals across different modalities while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. We introduce a novel backward correction strategy that optimizes within a sliding window of the past histories, allowing for a seamless trade-off between explore-and-exploit during optimization. MolJO achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Success Rate 51.3%, Vina Dock -9.05 and SA 0.78), more than 4x improvement in Success Rate compared to the gradient-based counterpart, and 2x "Me-Better" Ratio as much as 3D baselines. Furthermore, we extend MolJO to a wide range of optimization settings, including multi-objective optimization and challenging tasks in drug design such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, further underscoring its versatility.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Folding for Nearest Neighbor Model Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nearest Neighbor model is the $\textit{de facto}$ thermodynamic model of RNA secondary structure formation and is a cornerstone of RNA structure prediction and sequence design. The current functional form (Turner 2004) contains $\approx13,000$ underlying thermodynamic parameters, and fitting these to both experimental and structural data is computationally challenging. Here, we leverage recent advances in $\textit{differentiable folding}$, a method for directly computing gradients of the RNA folding algorithms, to devise an efficient, scalable, and flexible means of parameter optimization that uses known RNA structures and thermodynamic experiments. Our method yields a significantly improved parameter set that outperforms existing baselines on all metrics, including an increase in the average predicted probability of ground-truth sequence-structure pairs for a single RNA family by over 23 orders of magnitude. Our framework provides a path towards drastically improved RNA models, enabling the flexible incorporation of new experimental data, definition of novel loss terms, large training sets, and even treatment as a module in larger deep learning pipelines. We make available a new database, RNAometer, with experimentally-determined stabilities for small RNA model systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and often lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, the Hierarchical Interaction Message Net (HimNet). Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). We systematically evaluate HimNet on eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and three challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria activity, and liver microsomal clearance, covering a broad range of pharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>UniMoMo: Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules for De Novo Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of target-specific molecules such as small molecules, peptides, and antibodies is vital for biological research and drug discovery. Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</description>
