      <title>Monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we aim to classify monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay. We especially focus our attention on edge ideals. The Cohen-Macaulayness of the last matching power of an edge ideal is characterized, providing an algebraic analogue of the famous Tutte theorem regarding graphs having a perfect matching. For chordal graphs, very well-covered graphs and Cameron-Walker graphs, we completely solve our problem.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.</description>

      <title>Descent and generation for noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work investigates a form of descent, in the fppf and h topologies, for generation of triangulated categories obtained from noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes. In addition, also the behaviour of generation with respect to the derived pushforward of proper morphisms is studied. This allows us to exhibit many new examples where the associated bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves admit strong generators. We achieve our main results by combining Matthew's concept of descendability with Stevenson's tensor actions on triangulated categories, allowing us to generalize statements regarding generation into the noncommutative setting. In particular, we establish a noncommutative generalization of Aoki's result to Azumaya algebras over quasi-excellent schemes. Moreover, as a byproduct of the tensor action, we extend Olander's result on countable Rouquier dimension to the noncommutative setting for Azumaya algebras over derived splinters, and we extend a result of Ballard-Iyengar-Lank-Mukhopadhyay-Pollitz regarding strong generation for schemes of prime characteristic to the case of Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Ideals of generic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the Hilbert series of some classes of ideals generated by generic forms of degree two and three, and investigate the difference to the Hilbert series of ideals generated by powers of linear generic forms of the corresponding degrees.</description>

      <title>Resolutions over strict complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(Q, \mathfrak{n})$ be a regular local ring and let $f_1, \ldots, f_c \in \mathfrak{n}^2$ be a $Q$-regular sequence. Set $(A, \mathfrak{m}) = (Q/(\mathbf{f}), \mathfrak{n}/(\mathbf{f}))$. Further assume that the initial forms
  $f_1^*, \ldots, f_c^*$ form a $G(Q) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}\mathfrak{n}^i/\mathfrak{n}^{i+1}$-regular sequence. Without loss of any generality assume $ord_Q(f_1) \geq ord_Q(f_2) \geq \cdots \geq ord_Q(f_c)$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and let $(\mathbb{F}, \partial)$ be a minimal free resolution of $M$. Then we prove that $ord(\partial_i) \leq ord_Q(f_1) - 1$ for all $i \gg 0$. We also construct an MCM $A$-module $M$ such that $ord(\partial_{2i+1}) = ord_Q(f_1) - 1$ for all $i \geq 0$. We also give a considerably simpler proof regarding the periodicity of ideals of minors of maps in a minimal free resolution of modules over arbitrary complete intersection rings (not necessarily strict).</description>

      <title>D\'{e}vissage for generation in derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is concerned with generation in the derived category of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology over a Noetherian scheme. We demonstrate a flavor of `d\'{e}vissage' by identifying two explicit collections of structure sheaves for closed subschemes that classically generate the bounded derived category. Amongst the two, one consists of those supported on the singular locus of the scheme. Moreover, building from the work of Aoki, we show the essential image of the derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes strongly generates the targets bounded derived category.</description>
