      <title>Discovery of 10,059 new three-dimensional periodic orbits of general three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059 three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of $m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\leq n\leq 20$ is an integer, among which 1,996 (about 20\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273 three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\neq 1$) along a different one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say, the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\'e, the founder of chaos theory.</description>

      <title>Real-time forecasting of chaotic dynamics from sparse data and autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time prediction of chaotic systems requires a nonlinear-reduced order model (ROM) to forecast the dynamics, and a stream of data from sensors to update the ROM. Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step strategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction of the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there are two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become numerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and noisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a lower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN), which is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on the latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy and sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method (DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from sensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial differential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the method provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise, sparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a localization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when applying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a numerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens opportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.</description>

      <title>Identifying efficient routes to laminarization: an optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherently nonlinear and chaotic nature of turbulent flows poses a major challenge for designing control strategies to maintain or induce low-drag laminar states. In this work, we study the concept of the minimal seed for relaminarization - the smallest perturbation of a turbulent state that triggers a direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate the identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear optimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step penalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to the nine-mode Moehlis-Faisst-Eckhardt model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the minimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While both of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent boundary -- the so-called edge of chaos -- they are generally unrelated and lie in qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different insights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that while the optimal perturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the mode representing streamwise vortices, or rolls, the optimal perturbation for relaminarization is distributed across multiple modes, without strong contributions in the roll or streak directions. While counterintuitive, this finding indicates that fully nonlinear control schemes exploiting the structure of the turbulent attractor might offer great improvements over classical methods based on linearizations and those which simply counteract the dominant features of the turbulent flow. The laminarizing trajectory obtained from the minimal seed for relaminarization also provides an efficient pathway out of the turbulent region of state space to the laminar state and can therefore inform the design and evaluation of flow control strategies for inducing laminarization.</description>

      <title>Self-Replication of Turbulent Puffs: On the edge between chaotic saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pipe flow is a canonical example where turbulence first appears intermittently in space and time, taking the form of localized structures termed puffs. Turbulence spreads via puff self-replication, which must out-compete puff decays to sustain it. Here we study the self-replication process, a transition from one to two puffs, using direct numerical simulations. We identify an edge state on the phase space boundary between the two states, demonstrate that it mediates the transition, and show that self-replication follows a previously proposed mechanism, with the edge state as its tipping point.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>
