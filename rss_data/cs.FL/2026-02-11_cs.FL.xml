      <title>Global Protocols under Rendezvous Synchrony: From Realizability to Type Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global protocol specifications are the starting point of top-down verification methodologies, and serve as a blueprint for synthesizing local specifications that guarantee the correctness of distributed implementations. In this work, we study global protocol specifications targeting distributed processes that communicate via rendezvous synchrony. We obtain the following positive results for the synchronous realizability problem: (a) realizability is decidable for global protocols over a transitive concurrency alphabet in 2-EXPTIME in the size of the protocol, and in 3-EXPTIME in the size of the alphabet, and (b) realizability is decidable in EXPTIME for global protocols that unambiguously represent their trace language. Unambiguous global protocols encompass fragments of directed and sender-driven choice protocols studied in prior work. Further, our reductions admit the corollary that the synchronous verification problem is solvable with the same complexity, where a candidate realization is included as part of the input. We then prove a negative result stating that synchronous realizability is undecidable in general. Finally, we propose a type system to check pi-calculus processes against local specifications in the form of synchronous communicating state machines. Our type system is the first to support processes with local mixed choice in the presence of session interleaving and~delegation.</description>

      <title>The Similarity Control Problem with Required Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to guarantee that a supervised system satisfies safety requirements of the specification, as well as requirements saying that in certain states certain events must be enabled, this paper introduces required events for discrete event systems and reconsiders the similarity control problem while taking all requirements from the specification into account. The notion of a covariant-contravariant simulation, which is finer than the conventional notion of simulation, is adopted to act as the behavioral relation of supervisory control theory. A necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is established and a method for synthesizing a maximally permissive supervisor is provided.</description>

      <title>Eve-positional languages: putting order into B\"uchi automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\omega$-regular language is Eve-positional if, in all games with this language as objective, the existential player can play optimally without keeping any information from the previous moves. This notion plays a crucial role in verification, automata theory and synthesis.
  Casares and Ohlmann recently gave several characterizations of Eve-positionallity of $\omega$-regular languages. For this, they introduce the notion $\varepsilon$-complete parity automaton and show (among other results) that an $\omega$-regular language is Eve-positional if and only if it can be recognized by some $\varepsilon$-completion of a deterministic parity automaton. Colcombet and Idir extended on their work, and obtained a more direct semantic characterization of Eve-positionality.
  We introduce a new formalism that characterizes the Eve-positional languages, consisting in a restriction of non-deterministic B\"uchi automata. This allows us to complete a missing implication in Casares and Ohlmann's work. We then use this formalism to describe a determinization procedure for non-deterministic B\"uchi automaton recognizing such languages, with size blow-up at most factorial. We also show that this construction is, in a suitable sense, optimal.</description>

      <title>Automata on Graph Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of finite automata concerns itself with words in a free monoid together with concatenation and without further structure. There are, however, important applications which use alphabets which are structured in some sense.
  We introduce automata over a particular type of structured data, namely an alphabet which is given as a (finite or infinite) directed graph. This constrains concatenation: two strings may only be concatenated if the end vertex of the first is equal to the start vertex of the second.
  We develop the beginnings of an automata theory for languages on graph alphabets. We show that they admit a Kleene theorem, relating rational and regular languages, and a Myhill-Nerode theorem, stating that languages are regular iff they have finite prefix or, equivalently, suffix quotient. We present determinization and minimization algorithms, but we also exhibit that regular languages are not stable by complementation.
  Finally, we mention how these structures could be generalized to presimplicial alphabets, where languages are no more freely generated.</description>

      <title>The hereditariness problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lifting problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture: namely, whether the validity of the conjecture for a quotient automaton can always be transferred (or "lifted") to the original automaton. Although a complete solution remains open, we show that it is sufficient to verify the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for three specific subclasses of reset automata: radical, simple, and quasi-simple. Our approach relies on establishing a Galois connection between the lattices of congruences and ideals of the transition monoid. This connection not only serves as the main tool in our proofs but also provides a systematic method for computing the radical ideal and for deriving structural insights about these classes. In particular, we show that for every simple or quasi-simple automaton $\mathcal{A}$, the transition monoid $\text{M}(\mathcal{A})$ possesses a unique ideal covering the minimal ideal of constant (reset) maps; a result of similar flavor holds for the class of radical automata.</description>

      <title>Passive Learning of Lattice Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a passive automata learning algorithm that can extract automata from recurrent networks with very large or even infinite alphabets. Our method combines overapproximations from the field of Abstract Interpretation and passive automata learning from the field of Grammatical Inference. We evaluate our algorithm by first comparing it with the state-of-the-art automata extraction algorithm from Recurrent Neural Networks trained on Tomita grammars. Then, we extend these experiments to regular languages with infinite alphabets, which we propose as a novel benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Complete Propositional Dynamic Logic for Regular Expressions with Lookahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider (logical) reasoning for regular expressions with lookahead (REwLA). In this paper, we give an axiomatic characterization for both the (match-)language equivalence and the largest substitution-closed equivalence that is sound for the (match-)language equivalence. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on finite linear orders, extended with two operators: the restriction to the identity relation and the restriction to its complement. Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA.</description>
