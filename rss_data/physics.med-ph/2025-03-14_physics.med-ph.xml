      <title>In-vitro measurements coupled with in-silico simulations for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard Bayesian framework, a likelihood function is required, which can be difficult or computationally expensive to derive for non homogeneous biological materials under complex mechanical loading conditions. Here, we propose a simple and practical approach based on in vitro measurements and in silico simulations using the likelihood free Bayesian inference with the finite element method simultaneously for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials. We implement this approach for distal, middle, and proximal human Achilles tendon specimens obtained from diabetic patients post amputation. A wide range of in vitro loading conditions are considered, including one step and two step relaxation, as well as incremental cyclic loading tests. In silico simulations are performed for the tendons assuming a fiber reinforced viscoelastic response, which is modeled separately for the ground matrix and fiber components. Initially, the calibration of the specimen specific parameters is predicted using Bayesian optimization and the sensitivity of each parameter is evaluated using the Sobol index and random forest. Then, the bounds of the parameters are used as priors, coupled with in vitro data in simulation based approximate Bayesian computations to calibrate and quantify the uncertainty of parameters. The results demonstrate that increasing the number of loading scenarios improves the accuracy of the best fit parameter set. Furthermore, approximate Bayesian inference shows that in silico simulations using the posterior parameters, can capture the uncertainty bounds of in vitro measurements. This approach provides a useful framework for stochastic calibration of constitutive material model parameters without the need to derive a likelihood function, regardless of the specimens geometry or loading conditions.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Point Cloud Diffusion Model for Deformable Liver Motion Tracking Via a Single Arbitrarily-Angled X-ray Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable liver motion tracking using a single X-ray projection enables real-time motion monitoring and treatment intervention. We introduce a conditional point cloud diffusion model-based framework for accurate and robust liver motion tracking from arbitrarily angled single X-ray projections (PCD-Liver), which estimates volumetric liver motion by solving deformable vector fields (DVFs) of a prior liver surface point cloud based on a single X-ray image. The model is patient-specific and consists of two main components: a rigid alignment model to estimate the liver's overall shifts and a conditional point cloud diffusion model that further corrects for liver surface deformations. Conditioned on motion-encoded features extracted from a single X-ray projection via a geometry-informed feature pooling layer, the diffusion model iteratively solves detailed liver surface DVFs in a projection angle-agnostic manner. The liver surface motion estimated by PCD-Liver serves as a boundary condition for a U-Net-based biomechanical model to infer internal liver motion and localize liver tumors. A dataset of ten liver cancer patients was used for evaluation. The accuracy of liver point cloud motion estimation was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), while liver tumor localization error was quantified using center-of-mass error (COME). The mean (standard deviation) RMSE, HD95, and COME of the prior liver or tumor before motion estimation were 8.86(1.51) mm, 10.88(2.56) mm, and 9.41(3.08) mm, respectively. After PCD-Liver motion estimation, the corresponding values improved to 3.59(0.28) mm, 4.29(0.62) mm, and 3.45(0.96) mm. Under highly noisy conditions, PCD-Liver maintained stable performance. This study presents an accurate and robust framework for deformable liver motion estimation and tumor localization in image-guided radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Institutional Free Market in Accredited Medical Physics Graduate Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Physics education is delivered through accredited programs with admissions and funding for students determined by individual institutions providing the educational experiences. Public data from accredited graduate programs, along with funding data, were used to analyze institutional trends in this educational market. Temporal trends from 2017 to 2023 show robust growth in MS graduates, increasing at an average of 17.7 per year, as compared to steady but modest growth in PhDs, increasing by 3.6 per year. The current status is there are nearly two MS graduates for every PhD graduate. Trends in funding show self-funding of students is a dominant pathway in domestic programs. Those programs dominated by accredited MS education have their largest fraction of faculty in radiation oncology departments, whereas those dominated by PhD education have their largest fraction of faculty in radiology departments. Overall NIH funding in the space of radiation diagnostics and therapeutics has been largely static over this timeframe, but with a notable 5 year rise in NCI funding. This can be contrasted to a substantial 5X-6X rise in NIH funding for engineering research in this same period, with significant increases in trainee funding there. Taken as a whole, this survey shows that growth in the field of medical physics education is dominated by MS graduates, presumably servicing the expanded growth needs for well-trained clinical physicists. However, the research infrastructure that supports PhD training in medical physics seems likely to be growing modestly and missing the growth trend of NIH funding that appears to show substantially more growth in non-accredited programs such as biomedical engineering. This data is useful to informing accreditation guidance on numbers of graduates to match the workforce needs or for inter-institutional planning around education goals.</description>

      <title>How Should We Evaluate Uncertainty in Accelerated MRI Reconstruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing accelerated MRI is an ill-posed problem. Machine learning has recently shown great promise at this task, but current approaches to quantifying uncertainty focus on measuring the variability in pixelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack structural understanding and they do not have a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this paper, we propose a new approach to evaluating reconstruction variability based on apparent anatomical changes in the reconstruction, which is more tightly related to common downstream tasks. We use image registration and segmentation to evaluate several common MRI reconstruction approaches, where uncertainty is measured via ensembling, for accelerated imaging. We demonstrate the intrinsic variability in reconstructed images and show that models with high scores on often used quality metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, can nonetheless display high levels of variance and bias in anatomical measures.</description>

      <title>Compact dose delivery of laser-accelerated high-energy electron beams towards radiotherapy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of very high energy electron (VHEE) beams for radiotherapy has been actively studied for over two decades due to their advantageous dose distribution, deep penetration depth and great potential of ultra-high dose-rate irradiation. Recently, laser-plasma wakefield accelerator (LWFA) has emerged as a promising method for the compact generation of VHEE beams, due to its substantially higher accelerating gradients compared to traditional radio-frequency accelerators. However, how to compactly deliver the LWFA-based VHEE beams of relatively large energy spread and create a maximum dose deeply inside the body remains very challenging. In this article, we present a simple dose delivery scheme utilizing only two dipole magnets for LWFA-based VHEE treatment. By adjusting the magnet strengths, the electron beams can be guided along different angular trajectories towards a precise position as deep as 20 cm within a water phantom, creating a maximum dose over the target region and significantly reducing the entrance dose. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, such a beam delivery approach is demonstrated to be insensitive to the beam energy spread and meanwhile capable of controlling precisely the dose-peak position in both lateral and longitudinal directions. As such, a uniform dose peak can be generated by the weighted sum of VHEE beams that reach different dose-peak depths. These results demonstrate that LWFA-based VHEE beams can be compactly delivered into a deep-seated tumor region in a controllable manner, thus advancing the development of the VHEE radiotherapy towards the practical clinical applications in the near future.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated projection of the electrocardiogram -- a feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PhysECG: a physically motivated projection of the 12 lead electrocardiogram, supported by a deep learning model trained on 21,799 recordings from the PTB-XL database and discuss its feasibility. The method allows to evaluate the epicardial activity (inverse problem of ECG imaging) and, in particular, to distinguish left and right ventricular activity, with statistical spread related to localization of the septum. The observed dyssynchrony resembles other experimental results. The foundations of the method are based on the molecular theory of biopotentials. The heart's activity in view of the method is decomposed into two processes: the passage of the electric activation wavefront and the response of cardiomyocytes. We introduce the idea of the electrode-resolved activity function, which represents the mass of the ventricle in Phase 0 of action potential within the lead field of each electrode. The computations are fast and robust, with excellent convergence. We present the quality metrics for the reconstruction based on the model on the testing set selected from the PTB database. In order to prove feasibility, we present and discuss two healthy controls: male and female, and two pathologies: right bundle branch block, and anterior myocardial infarction. The results obtained using PhysECG seem to be in accordance with the changes evoked by pathology, which has to be confirmed by subsequent clinical studies. The method is based on ECG, and does not require reconstruction of body geometry, which presents an affordable solution for low and middle-income countries where access to imaging is limited.</description>
