      <title>Voronoi Entropy and long-range order of 2D point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voronoi Entropy (VE) and the continuous measure of symmetry (CSM) characterize the orderliness of a set of points on a 2D plane. The Voronoi entropy is the Shannon entropy of the Voronoi tessellation of the plane into polygons, quantifying the diversity of polygons. The VE is widely used to study the self-assembly of colloidal, supramolecular, and other systems. The value of VE changes from S=0 for a completely ordered system, built of polygons with an equal number of sides, to S=1.690+/-0.001 for a random set of points. While the VE takes into account only neighboring polygons, covering the 2D plane imposes constraints on the number of polygons and the number of edges in polygons. Consequently, unlike the conventional Shannon Entropy, the VE captures some long-range order properties of the system. We calculate the VE for several hyperuniform sets of points and compare it with the values of exponents of collective density variables characterizing long-range correlations in the system. We show that the VE correlates with the latter up to a certain saturation level, after which the value of the VE falls to S=0, and we explain this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Advantages of fixing spins in quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing can efficiently obtain solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Size-reduction methods are used to treat large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be input directly into a quantum annealer because of its size limitation. Various size-reduction methods using fixing spins have been proposed as quantum-classical hybrid methods to obtain solutions. However, the high performance of these hybrid methods is yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we adopted a parameterized fixing spins method to verify the effects of fixing spins. The results revealed that setting the appropriate number of spins of the subproblem is crucial for obtaining a satisfactory solution, and the energy gap expansion is confirmed after fixing spins.</description>

      <title>R-Ising: Effective resistance in random magnetic nanowires networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random assemblies of magnetic nanowires represent a unique class of materials with promising applications in spintronics and information storage. These assemblies exhibit complex behavior %interactions due to the combination of magnetic dipolar interactions between the nanowires and electronic transport properties governed by tunneling barriers at magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The intricate interplay of these phenomena makes the study of magnetic nanowire networks a rich area of research. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the resistive behavior of random magnetic nanowire networks. By employing a combination of graph theoretical approaches and mean-field theory, we derive an effective resistance model that encapsulates the contributions of magnetic interactions between the nanowires. Our findings show the importance of considering both the magnetic and electrical properties of nanowire networks in the design and optimization of amorphous resistive devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical metastability and re-entrant localization of trapped active elements with speed and orientation fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of active elements performing persistent random motion with fluctuating active speed and in the presence of translational noise in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap, modeling active speed generation through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our approach employs an exact analytic method based on the Fokker-Planck equation to compute time-dependent moments of any dynamical variable of interest across arbitrary dimensions. We analyze dynamical crossovers in particle displacement before reaching the steady state, focusing on three key timescales: speed relaxation, persistence, and dynamical relaxation in the trap. Notably, for slow active speed relaxation, we observe an intermediate time metastable saturation in the mean-squared displacement before reaching the final steady state. The steady-state distributions of particle positions exhibit two types of non-Gaussian departures based on control parameters: bimodal distributions with negative excess kurtosis and heavy-tailed unimodal distributions with positive excess kurtosis. We obtain detailed steady-state phase diagrams using the exact calculation of excess kurtosis, identifying Gaussian and non-Gaussian regions and possible re-entrant transitions.</description>

      <title>Generalized arcsine laws for a sluggish random walker with subdiffusive growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simple one dimensional sluggish random walk model with subdiffusive growth. In the continuum hydrodynamic limit, the model corresponds to a particle diffusing on a line with a space dependent diffusion constant D(x)= |x|^{-\alpha} and a drift potential U(x)=|x|^{-\alpha}, where \alpha\geq 0 parametrizes the model. For \alpha=0 it reduces to the standard diffusion, while for \alpha&gt;0 it leads to a slow subdiffusive dynamics with the distance scaling as x\sim t^{\mu} at late times with \mu= 1/(\alpha+2)\leq 1/2. In this paper, we compute exactly, for all \alpha\ge 0, the full probability distributions of three observables for a sluggish walker of duration T starting at the origin: (i) the occupation time t_+ denoting the time spent on the positive side of the origin, (ii) the last passage time t_{\rm l} through the origin before T, and (iii) the time t_M at which the walker is maximally displaced on the positive side of the origin. We show that while for \alpha=0 all three distributions are identical and exhibit the celebrated arcsine laws of L\'evy, they become different from each other for any \alpha&gt;0 and have nontrivial shapes dependent on \alpha. This generalizes the L\'evy's three arcsine laws for normal diffusion (\alpha=0) to the subdiffusive sluggish walker model with a general \alpha\geq 0. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein--Uhlenbeck particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein--Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cost through Dynamic Stochastic Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of stochastic resetting is considered within the context of a discrete random walk model. In addition to standard stochastic resetting, for which a reset occurs with a certain probability after \emph{each} step, we introduce a novel resetting protocol which we dubbed {\it dynamic resetting}. This protocol entails an additional dynamic constraint related to the direction of successive steps of the random walker. We study this novel protocol for a one-dimensional random walker on an infinite lattice. We analyze the impact of the constraint on the walker's mean-first passage time and the cost (fluctuations) of the resets as a function of distance of target from the resetting location. Further, cost optimized search strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observable-projected ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a $\textit{fully local}$ Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly and non-equilibrium phase coexistence in a binary granular mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of a square crystalline phase in a vibrated binary mixture of spherical grains. This structure spontaneously forms from a disordered state, consistently with predictions obtained in an equilibrium system with similar geometrical properties under conservative dynamics. By varying the area fraction, we also observe stable coexistence between a granular fluid and an isolated square crystal. Using realistic simulations based on the discrete element method and an idealized collisional model integrated via event-driven molecular dynamics, we not only reproduce experimental results but also help to gain further insights into the non-equilibrium phase coexistence. Through the direct phase coexistence method, we demonstrate that the system shows behavior highly similar to an equilibrium first-order phase transition. However, the crystal remains at a higher granular temperature than the fluid, which is a striking non-equilibrium effect. Through qualitative argument and supported by kinetic theory, we elucidate the role of the coupling between local structure and energy transfer mechanisms in sustaining kinetic temperature gradients across the fluid-solid interface.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Scars through the Lens of Correlation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS with either known analytic expressions or can be captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively isolate QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables easy manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.</description>

      <title>Directional derivatives and the central limit theorem on compact general one-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will show the central limit theorem for the general one-dimensional lattice where the space of symbols is a compact metric space. We consider the CLT for Lipschitz-Gibbs probabilities and in the proof we use several properties of the Ruelle operator defined on our setting; this will require fixing an {\em a priori probability}. An important issue in the proof of the CLT is the existence of a certain second-order derivative, and this will follow from the analytic properties that will be described in detail throughout the paper. As additional results of independent interest, we will also describe some explicit estimates of the first and second directional derivatives of some dynamical entities like entropy and pressure. For example: given a fixed potential $f$, and a variable observable $\eta$ on the Kernel of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_f$, we consider the equilibrium probability $\mu_{f + t \,\eta}$ for $f + t \,\eta$. We estimate the values $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ and $ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$, where $h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})$ is the entropy of $ \mu_{C + t \,\eta}$. For fixed $f$ we can find conditions that can indicate the $\eta$ attaining the maximal possible value of $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ (up to a natural normalization of $\eta)$, entirely in terms of elements on the kernel of $\mathcal{L}_f$. We also consider directional derivatives of the eigenfunction.</description>

Abstract: We propose inverse renormalization group transformations to construct approximate configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed by supercomputers or large-scale simulations in the study of spin glasses. Specifically, starting from lattices of volume $V=8^{3}$ in the case of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model we employ machine learning algorithms to construct rescaled lattices up to $V'=128^{3}$, which we utilize to extract two critical exponents. We conclude by discussing how to incorporate numerical exactness within inverse renormalization group methods of disordered systems, thus opening up the opportunity to explore a sustainable and energy-efficient generation of exact configurations for increasing lattice volumes without the use of dedicated supercomputers.</description>

      <title>The Inertial Spin Model of flocking with position-dependent forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension to the ISM of flocking and swarming. The model has been introduced to explain certain dynamic features of swarming (second sound, a lower than expected dynamic critical exponent) while preserving the mechanism for onset of order provided by the Vicsek model. The ISM has only been formulated with an imitation (``ferromagnetic'') interaction between velocities. Here we show how to add position-dependent forces in the model, which allows to consider effects such as cohesion, excluded volume, confinement and perturbation with external position-dependent field, and thus study this model without periodic boundary conditions. We study numerically a single particle with an harmonic confining field and compare it to a Brownian harmonic oscillator and to a harmonically confined active Browinian particle, finding qualitatively different behavior in the three cases.</description>

      <title>SWAP algorithm for lattice spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapted the SWAP molecular dynamics algorithm for use in lattice Ising spin models. We dressed the spins with a randomly distributed length and we alternated long-range spin exchanges with conventional single spin flip Monte Carlo updates, both accepted with a stochastic rule which respects detailed balance. We show that this algorithm, when applied to the bidimensional Edwards-Anderson model, speeds up significantly the relaxation at low temperatures and manages to find ground states with high efficiency and little computational cost. The exploration of spin models should help in understanding why SWAP accelerates the evolution of particle systems and shed light on relations between dynamics and free-energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for $p$-spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network algorithm for the solution of $p$-spin models. We show that bond compression through rank-revealing decompositions performed during the tensor network contraction resolves logical redundancies in the system exactly and is thus lossless, yet leads to qualitative changes in runtime scaling in different regimes of the model. First, we find that bond compression emulates the so-called leaf-removal algorithm, solving the problem efficiently in the "easy" phase. Past a dynamical phase transition, we observe superpolynomial runtimes, reflecting the appearance of a core component. We then develop a graphical method to study the scaling of contraction for a minimal ensemble of core-only instances. We find subexponential scaling, improving on the exponential scaling that occurs without compression. Our results suggest that our tensor network algorithm subsumes the classical leaf removal algorithm and simplifies redundancies in the $p$-spin model through lossless compression, all without explicit knowledge of the problem's structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamical activity universally bounds precision of response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of an essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Landscape Transitions and Coding Barren Plateaus in Hybrid Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement-induced barren plateau is an exponential vanishing of the parameter gradients with system size that limits the practical application of variational quantum algorithms(VQA). A landscape transition from barren plateau to no-barren plateau was recently observed in monitored quantum circuits, hypothesized to coincide with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) that separates the area-law states from the volume-law states. We argue from an information theory perspective that these are different transitions. This hypothesis is supported by a numerical study that includes cost-gradient variances, visualizations of the optimization runs and cost-landscape, and a quantum-classical channel mutual information measure. The results are evidence for a universal measurement-induced landscape transition (MILT) at $p_c^{\text{MILT}} \approx 0.2 &lt; p_c^{\text{MIPT}}$ and that throughout $0&lt;p&lt;p_c^{\text{MILT}}$, there is a finite quantum-classical channel mutual information in the limit of a large number of qubits. Unlike the barren plateau without measurements, a non-zero rate of measurements induces a coding barren plateau where, typically, information about the parameters is available to a local cost function despite a vanishing gradient.</description>

      <title>The $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>
