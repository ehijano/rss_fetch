      <title>Discovering Polynomial and Quadratic Structure in Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with quadratic or polynomial drift exhibit complex dynamics, yet compared to nonlinear systems in general form, are often easier to analyze, simulate, control, and learn. Results going back over a century have shown that the majority of nonpolynomial nonlinear systems can be recast in polynomial form, and their degree can be reduced further to quadratic. This process of polynomialization/quadratization reveals new variables (in most cases, additional variables have to be added to achieve this) in which the system dynamics adhere to that specific form, which leads us to discover new structures of a model. This chapter summarizes the state of the art for the discovery of polynomial and quadratic representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems. We review known existence results, discuss the two prevalent algorithms for automating the discovery process, and give examples in form of a single-layer neural network and a phenomenological model of cell signaling.</description>

      <title>Landscapes and nonequilibrium fluctuations of eukaryotic gene regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among processes that occur over different timescales is a challenging issue in the physics of systems regulation. In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations. This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how multilayer regulation of chromatin, or deep epigenetic regulation, can flexibly tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.
  We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.
  We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.</description>

      <title>A theoretical investigation provides an integrated understanding of the complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning has been defined using data collected over decades. The network, embedded in the root epidermis, contains positive and negative feedback loops, cell-cell signalling within the epidermal tissue, and receives positional signalling from underlying tissue. While there are extensive data regarding individual components and their interactions within the network, the sufficiency of the regulatory network to produce robust epidermal patterning is not clear, nor is it clear how individual components and interactions work together to ensure correct epidermal patterning. Mathematical modelling was used to address the questions of sufficiency, and to gain an integrated understanding of collective behaviour emerging from individual components and interactions within the regulatory network. Theoretical experiments were performed on a model of the root hair patterning regulatory network. It was found that our current understanding of the epidermal patterning network was insufficient to reproduce experimental data. The model was used to hypothesise the existence of an additional negative feedback loop which, when added to the currently understood regulatory network, enabled the model to reproduce wild type and mutant root hair patterning. Results of theoretical experiments on the modified regulatory network were used to; define an essential relationship between diffusive movement of two cell-cell signalling proteins; show that directed movement dysregulation of another cell-cell signalling protein causes root hair patterning to appear as though it no longer receives positional cues; and show that cooperativity or oligomerisation within the regulatory network's positive feedback loop are essential. This work presents an integrated, exploration of the regulatory network controlling epidermal root hair patterning in Arabidopsis.</description>
