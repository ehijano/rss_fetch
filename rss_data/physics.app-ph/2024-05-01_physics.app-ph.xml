      <title>Reconfigurable nonreciprocal heat transport with natural bulk materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocity is increasingly scrutinised in contemporary physics and engineering, especially in the realm of heat transport. This concept opens up novel avenues for directional heat transport and thermal regulation. Nonetheless, the development of non-reciprocal thermal metamaterials confronts three primary challenges: a constrained operational temperature range and structural scale, considerable energy dissipation, and the limitation of non-reciprocal effects due to external parameters that are not freely adjustable. To surmount these hurdles, we propose a reconfigurable approach to non-reciprocal heat transport. The design features a simple asymmetrical structure, with a flat panel made of natural, evenly-distributed material, positioned vertically on one side of a central horizontal board.We employ natural convection on the vertical plate to facilitate non-reciprocal heat transport. The reconfigurability of non-reciprocal heat transport is achieved by adjusting the number of vertical plates and their thermal conductivity. Theoretical computations of the rectification ratio are employed to quantify and forecast the non-reciprocal effect, corroborated by simulations and empirical studies. We also establish correlations between the rectification ratio and various parameters, including the vertical plates' positioning and height, ambient temperature, and the temperature differential between heat sources. Control over multiple parameters can efficaciously widen the scope of non-reciprocal control and streamline experimental procedures. Furthermore, our research exclusively utilises the natural convection of air for non-reciprocal heat transport, obviating the need for Supplementary energy sources and markedly enhancing energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tight Non-Radiating Bends of 3D-Printed Dielectric Image Lines Based on Electromagnetic Bandgap Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on a novel compact, low-loss bending technique for additively manufactured dielectric image lines between 140 GHz and 220 GHz. Conventional bending approaches require either large curvature radii or technologically challenging permittivity variations to prevent radiation loss at line discontinuities, e.g. caused by narrow bends. In contrast, this work uses extremely compact, easy-to-manufacture electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) cells to solve the afore mentioned challenge for the first time. These offer excellent reflection properties and thus enable broadband and low-loss (IL &lt; 1 dB) guidance of electromagnetic waves by means of total reflection. Without increasing the complexity of the process, both the high-pass behaviour and the enormous space requirement of conventional dielectric bends are completely avoided. In addition, the use of EBGs improves the mutual isolation of dielectric image lines of up to 30 dB. Therefore, a promising solution for the realization of narrow, 3D-printed, low-loss signal distribution networks in the sub-THz domain is offered.</description>

      <title>One-way Valley-locked waveguide with large channel achieved by all-dielectric Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity, which denotes the asymmetric or even unidirectional transmission of light, constitutes the cornerstone of modern photonic circuits. In the realm of photonic devices, it has been widely utilized in isolators, circulators and so on. Recent topology in artificial materials, an unprecedented degree of freedom, has been proposed to solve the effect of impurities on nonreciprocal transmission. However, in view of the bulk-edge correspondence, the spatial width of the transmission channel with uniform field distribution is quite narrow and needs further exploration. In this paper, we proposed a one-way valley-locked waveguide with a large channel in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. Quite different from the topological edge modes, the unidirectional property of our waveguide comes from the bulk modes with valley-lock, which can fully utilize the whole dimension of the structure with an efficiency of 100%. Additionally, the electrical field is uniformly distributed across the entire channel, which opens a new avenue for low-loss nonreciprocity devices.</description>

      <title>Directed High-Energy Infrared Laser Beams for Photovoltaic Generation of Electric Power at Remote Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring energy without transferring mass is a powerful paradigm to address the challenges faced when the access to, or the deployment of, the infrastructure for energy conversion is locally impossible or impractical. Laser beaming holds the promise of effectively implementing this paradigm. With this perspective, this work evaluates the optical-to-electrical power conversion that is created when a collimated laser beam illuminates a silicon photovoltaic solar cell that is located kilometers away from the laser. The laser is a CW high-energy Yb-doped fiber laser emitting at a center wavelength of 1075 nm with ~1 m2 of effective beam area. For 20 kW illumination of a solar panel having 0.6 m2 of area, optical simulations and thermal simulations indicate electrical output power of 3000 Watts at a panel temperature of 550 K. Our investigations show that thermo-radiative cells are rather inefficient. In contrast, an optimized approach to harvest laser energy is achieved by using a hybrid module consisting of a photovoltaic cell and a thermo-electric generator. Finally, practical considerations related to infrared power beaming are discussed and its potential applications are outlined.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Validation of Tape-Based Metasurfaces in Guiding High-Frequency Surface Waves for Efficient Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective method for transmitting electromagnetic waves as surface waves with a tape-based metasurface design. This design incorporates silver square patches periodically patterned on an adhesive tape substrate. Specifically, our study proposes a strategy to enhance the efficiency of power transfer in high-frequency bands by guiding signals as surface waves rather than free-space waves. Both the numerical and experimental results validate the markedly enhanced efficiency in power transfer of high-frequency signals compared to that achieved with conventional methods, such as wireless power transfer and microstrips. Importantly, our metasurface design can be readily manufactured and tailored for various environments. Thus, our study contributes to designing power-efficient next-generation communication systems such as 6G and 7G, which leverage high-frequency signals in the millimeter-wave and THz bands.</description>

      <title>Tuning the response of bubble-based metamaterials with short transient pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble-based metamaterials have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally thanks to their simple geometry and their ability to manipulate acoustic waves. The latter is partly dependent on the structural characteristics of the metamaterial and partly dependent on the incident acoustic wave. Initially, the selection of specific structural characteristics is explained by presenting the Fourier transformations of the reflected waves for different arrangements of a bubbly meta-screen subject to Gaussian excitation. Next, our numerical study focuses on the changes induced to the response of a bubbly meta-screen, subject to different excitation pulses. For complex-frequency excitation the bubbles delay to return to their equilibrium position for a couple of moments, hence the energy is stored in the system during those moments. This research provides a new strategy to actively control the response of a bubbly meta-screen and seeks to inspire future studies towards further optimization of the incident pulse based on the functionalities in need.</description>

      <title>Shrinking a gradient index lens antenna system with a spaceplate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of optical systems is an ongoing challenge across the electromagnetic spectrum. While the thickness of optical elements themselves can be reduced using advances in metamaterials, it is the voids between these elements -- which are necessary parts of an optical system -- that occupy most of the volume. Recently, a novel optical element coined a `spaceplate' was proposed, that replaces a region of free space with a thinner optical element that emulates the free-space optical response function -- thus having the potential to substantially shrink the volume of optical systems. While there have been a few proof-of-principle demonstrations of spaceplates, they have not yet been deployed in a real-world optical system. In this work, we use a bespoke-designed spaceplate to reduce the length of a gradient index (GRIN) lens microwave antenna. Our antenna is designed to operate at 23.5 GHz, and the incorporation of a nonlocal metamaterial spaceplate enables the distance between the antenna feed and the GRIN lens to be reduced by almost a factor of two. We find the radiation patterns from a conventional and space-squeezed antenna are very similar, with a very low cross-polarisation, and only a minor increase in the side-lobe levels when introducing the spaceplate. Our work represents a first example of a spaceplate integrated into a functional optical system, highlighting the potential for this concept to reduce the physical size of optical systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spatio-temporal strain imaging reveals loss mechanisms in a surface acoustic wave device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave devices are key components for processing radio frequency signals in wireless communication because these devices offer simultaneously high performance, compact size and low cost. The optimization of the device structure requires a quantitative understanding of energy conversion and loss mechanisms. Stroboscopic full-field diffraction x-ray microscopy studies of a prototypical one-port resonator device revealed the existence of unanticipated acoustic loss. A non-uniform acoustic excitation in the active area was responsible for the substantial end and side leakages observed at the design frequency. Quantitative analysis of the strain amplitude using a wave decomposition method allowed the determination of several key device parameters. This high-resolution spatiotemporal strain imaging technique is, more generally, suited for studying nanophononics, specifically when the feature size is smaller than optical wavelengths. The strain sensitivity allows precise measurement of acoustic waves with picometer-scale amplitude.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Mode Optimisation by Background Anti-Resonance Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Significant tuning of internal mode coupling in doubly clamped MEMS beam resonators by thermal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermodal coupling has been demonstrated to be a promising mechanism for the development of advanced micro/nanoelectromechanical devices. However, strong mode coupling remains a key challenge limiting the practical application of intermodal coupling. Furthermore, the insight into physical mechanisms underlying mode coupling and the capability to quantitatively tune the mode coupling is also limited. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the significant tunability of mode coupling by using the thermal tuning effect, yet in an asymmetric doubly-clamped MEMS beam resonator, enabling various coupling strength to be implemented for practical applications. In this system, two out-of-plane vibrational modes are mechanically coupled through displacement-induced tension, and their mode coupling strength arises from both hardening and softening nonlinearities of the two modes, thus allowing for the tuning of mode coupling strength by thermally enhancing the softening nonlinearity of the MEMS beam. Our results demonstrate a feasible approach to tune the mode coupling and offer insights into fundamental mechanism of mode coupling in MEMS beam resonators, paving the way for the development of MEMS resonators with enhanced performance and application-specific tunability.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Transport Characteristics of Triply Periodic Bicontinuous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D bicontinuous two-phase materials are increasingly gaining interest because of their unique multifunctional characteristics and advancements in techniques to fabricate them. Due to their complex topological and structural properties, it still has been nontrivial to develop explicit microstructure-dependent formulas to predict accurately their physical properties. A primary goal of the present paper is to ascertain various microstructural and transport characteristics of five different models of triply periodic bicontinuous porous materials at a porosity $\phi_1=1/2$: those in which the two-phase interfaces are the Schwarz P, Schwarz D and Schoen G minimal surfaces as well as two different pore-channel structures. We ascertain their spectral densities, pore-size distribution functions, local volume-fraction variances, and hyperuniformity order metrics and then use this information to estimate certain effective transport properties via closed-form microstructure-property formulas. Specifically, we estimate the recently introduced time-dependent diffusion spreadability exactly from the spectral density. Moreover, we accurately estimate the fluid permeability of such porous materials from the second moment of the pore-size function and the formation factor, a measure of the tortuosity of the pore space. We also rigorously bound the permeability from above using the spectral density. For the five models with identical cubic unit cells, we find that the permeability, inverse of the specific surface, hyperuniformity order metric, pore-size second moment and long-time spreadability behavior are all positively correlated and rank order the structures in exactly the same way. We also conjecture what structures maximize the fluid permeability for arbitrary porosities and show that this conjecture must be true in the extreme porosity limits by identifying the corresponding optimal structures.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability and phase transformation of $\alpha$-, $\kappa(\epsilon)$-, and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ thin films to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ under various ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in metastable $\alpha$-, $\kappa(\epsilon)$-, and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films to thermodynamically stable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ during annealing in air, N$_2$, and vacuum have been systematically investigated via in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. These respective polymorphs exhibited thermal stability to around 471-525$^\circ$C, 773-825$^\circ$C, and 490-575$^\circ$C before transforming into $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, across all tested ambient conditions. Particular crystallographic orientation relationships were observed before and after the phase transitions, i.e., (0006) $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ $(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, (004) $\kappa(\epsilon)$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ (310) and $(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and (400) $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ (400) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The phase transition of $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ resulted in catastrophic damage to the film and upheaval of the surface. The respective primary and possibly secondary causes of this damage are the +8.6% volume expansion and the dual displacive and reconstructive transformations that occur during this transition. The $\kappa(\epsilon)$- and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films converted to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via singular reconstructive transformations with small changes in volume and unchanged surface microstructures.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-noise pulse-compression thermography: a powerful tool for time-domain thermography analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse-compression is a correlation-based measurement technique successfully used in many NDE applications to increase the SNR in the presence of huge noise, strong signal attenuation or when high excitation levels must be avoided. In thermography, the pulse-compression approach was firstly introduced in 2005 by Mulavesaala and co-workers, and then further developed by Mandelis and co-authors that applied to thermography the concept of the thermal-wave radar developed for photothermal measurements. Since then, many measurement schemes and applications have been reported in the literature by several groups by using various heating sources, coded excitation signals, and processing algorithms. The variety of such techniques is known as pulse-compression thermography or thermal-wave radar imaging. Even despite the continuous improvement of these techniques during these years, the advantages of using a correlation-based approach in thermography are still not fully exploited and recognized by the community. This is because up to now the reconstructed thermograms' time sequences after pulse-compression were affected by the so-called sidelobes. This is a severe drawback since it hampers an easy interpretation of the data and their comparison with other thermography techniques. To overcome this issue and unleash the full potential of the approach, this paper shows how it is possible to implement a pulse-compression thermography procedure capable of suppressing any sidelobe by using a pseudo-noise excitation and a proper processing algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>

Abstract: Though extensively studied since the emergence of zincblende cubic A(B,C) semiconductor alloys (zb-SCA) in the sixties, the phonon mode behavior of Ga(As,P) remains a subject of debate to this day. Recently Zollner and co-authors reported on a thorough far-infrared (IR) ellipsometry study of the vibrational spectra of Ga(As,P) spanning the composition domain. They suggest that their experimental data are better described by the cluster model than by our percolation model. On the basis of Zollner experimental data, kindly made available to us, we derive an improved version of the percolation model that explains the phonon mode behavior of Ga(As,P) beyond existing CM and PM approaches, with ab initio phonon calculations in support.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>
