      <title>Social Simulations with Large Language Model Risk Utopian Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining, predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions, and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies. However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications. Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias, resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs that capture the diversity of human social behavior.</description>

      <title>Shift Bribery over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.</description>

      <title>World-POI: Global Point-of-Interest Data Enriched from Foursquare and OpenStreetMap as Tabular and Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity. Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial analyses and a range of downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Socio-Technical Topology-Aware Adaptive Threat Detection in Software Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic, heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs. We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for software supply chain security research.</description>

      <title>Just Another Hour on TikTok: ID sampling to obtain a complete slice of TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13279v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. Despite preliminary studies, issues remain in determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample of &gt;99% of posts from a given time range on TikTok, and use it to collect all posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside all posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media, and comments from a close-to-complete slice of TikTok, and report the critical statistics of the platform. Notably, we estimate a total of 269 million posts produced on the day we looked at, that 18% of videos on the platform feature children, and that at least 0.5% of posts contain artificial intelligence-generated content.</description>

      <title>The Risks of Industry Influence in Tech Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging information technologies like social media, search engines, and AI can have a broad impact on public health, political institutions, social dynamics, and the natural world. It is critical to develop a scientific understanding of these impacts to inform evidence-based technology policy that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Unlike most other global-scale scientific challenges, however, the data necessary for scientific progress are generated and controlled by the same industry that might be subject to evidence-based regulation. Moreover, technology companies historically have been, and continue to be, a major source of funding for this field. These asymmetries in information and funding raise significant concerns about the potential for undue industry influence on the scientific record. In this Perspective, we explore how technology companies can influence our scientific understanding of their products. We argue that science faces unique challenges in the context of technology research that will require strengthening existing safeguards and constructing wholly new ones.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, agents interact with each other and can change their opinions as a result of those interactions. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if their opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, researchers typically assume that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social interactions, and it is desirable to account for it. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social-interaction event times, which can follow arbitrary interevent-time distributions (ITDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We analyze the quantitative impact of ITDs on the transient dynamics of BCMs and derive approximate master equations for the time-dependent expectations of the BCM dynamics. We find that BCMs with Markovian ITDs have consistent statistical properties (in particular, they have the same expected time-dependent opinions) when the ITDs have the same mean but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian ITDs depend on the type of ITD even when the ITDs have the same mean. Additionally, we numerically examine the transient and steady-state dynamics of our models with various ITDs on different networks and compare their expected order-parameter values and expected convergence times.</description>

      <title>Making Classic GNNs Strong Baselines Across Varying Homophily: A Smoothness-Generalization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success but are often considered to be challenged by varying levels of homophily in graphs. Recent \textit{empirical} studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel \textit{smoothness-generalization dilemma}, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in high-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise or sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants. Our code and datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/galogm/IGNN}{https://github.com/galogm/IGNN}.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</description>

      <title>Preference-driven Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs (TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs. Our code is be available.</description>
