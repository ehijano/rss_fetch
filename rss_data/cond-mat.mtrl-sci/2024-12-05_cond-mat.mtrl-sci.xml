      <title>Electrically Interconnected Platinum Nanonetworks for Flexible Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible electronics are attracting attention due to the increasing demand for lightweight, bendable devices that can conform to various surfaces, including human skin. Although indium tin oxide (ITO) is widely used for electrical interconnection in flexible electronics, its brittleness limits its durability under repeated bending. In this study, we introduce platinum (Pt) nanonetworks as an alternative to ITO, offering superior electrical stability under intense and repeated bending conditions. Electrically interconnected Pt nanonetworks, with an average thickness below 50 nm, are fabricated on polyimide (PI) substrates through an atmospheric treatment that promotes nanophase separation in thin deposition films of a platinum-cerium (Pt-Ce) alloy, creating a nanotexture of Pt and insulating cerium dioxide (CeO2). The resulting Pt nanonetworks on PI exhibit high mechanical flexibility, maintaining a sheet resistance of approximately 2.76 kohm/sq even after 1000 bending cycles at varying diameters, down to 1.5 mm. Detailed characterization reveals critical temperature and time thresholds in the atmospheric treatment necessary to form interconnected Pt nanonetworks on solid surfaces: interconnected nanonetworks form at lower temperatures and shorter treatment times, while higher temperatures and longer treatments lead to disconnected Pt nanoislands. LCR (Inductance, Capacitance, and Resistance) measurements further show that the interconnected Pt nanonetworks exhibit inductor-like electrical responses, while disconnected Pt nanoislands display capacitor-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Imaging of the Band Topology of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of Bloch bands are intimately tied to the structure of their electronic wavefunctions within the unit cell of a crystal. Here, we show that scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor WSe$_2$ can be used to unambiguously fix the location of the Wannier center of the valence band. Using site-specific substitutional doping, we first determine the position of the atomic sites within STM images, establishing that the maximum electronic density of states at the $K$-point lies between the atoms. In contrast, the maximum density of states at the $\Gamma$ point is at the atomic sites. This signifies that WSe$_2$ is a topologically obstructed atomic insulator, which cannot be adiabatically transformed to the trivial atomic insulator limit.</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive relations from experiments: 1. PDE constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to accurately and efficiently identify the constitutive behavior of complex materials through full-field observations. We formulate the problem of inferring constitutive relations from experiments as an indirect inverse problem that is constrained by the balance laws. Specifically, we seek to find a constitutive behavior that minimizes the difference between the experimental observation and the corresponding quantities computed with the model, while enforcing the balance laws. We formulate the forward problem as a boundary value problem corresponding to the experiment, and compute the sensitivity of the objective with respect to model using the adjoint method. The resulting method is robust and can be applied to constitutive models with arbitrary complexity. We focus on elasto-viscoplasticity, but the approach can be extended to other settings. In this part one, we formulate the method and demonstrate it using synthetic data on two problems, one quasistatic and the other dynamic.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>CuXASNet: Rapid and Accurate Prediction of Copper L-edge X-Ray Absorption Spectra Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed CuXASNet, a dense neural network that predicts simulated Cu L-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) from atomic structures. Featurization of the Cu local environment is performed using a component of M3GNet, a graph neural network developed for predicting the potential energy surface. CuXASNet is trained on simulated spectra from FEFF9 at the multiple scattering level of theory, and can predict the L3 and L2 edges for Cu sites to quantitative accuracy. To validate our approach, we compare 14 experimental spectra extracted from the literature with the predictions of CuXASNet. The agreement of CuXASNet with experiments is shown by an average MAE of 0.125 and an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.891, which is comparable to FEFF9's values of 0.131 and 0.898 for the same metrics. As such, CuXASNet can rapidly generate a large number of L-edge XAS spectra at the same accuracy as FEFF9 simulations. This can be used as a drop-in replacement for multiple scattering codes for fast screening of candidate atomic structure models of a measured system. This model establishes a general framework for Cu XAS prediction, and can be extended to more computationally expensive levels of theory and to other transition metal L-edges.</description>

      <title>Fast and stable tight-binding framework for nonlocal kinetic energy density functional reconstruction in orbital-free density functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) with density-dependent kernels are currently the most accurate functionals available for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) calculations. However, despite advances in numerical techniques and using only (semi)local density-dependent kernels, nonlocal KEDFs still present substantial computational costs in OF-DFT, limiting their application in large-scale material simulations. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient framework for reconstructing nonlocal KEDFs by incorporating the density functional tight-binding approach, in which the energy functionals are simplified through a first-order functional expansion based on the superposition of free-atom electron densities. This strategy allows the computationally expensive nonlocal kinetic energy and potential calculations to be performed only once during the electron density optimization process, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Benchmark tests using advanced nonlocal KEDFs, such as revHC and LDAK-MGPA, on standard structures including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Si, III-V semiconductors, as well as Mg$_{50}$ and Si$_{50}$ clusters, demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, providing a cost-effective balance between accuracy and computational speed. Additionally, the reconstructed functionals exhibit improved numerical stability for both bulk and finite systems, paving the way for developing more sophisticated KEDFs for realistic material simulations using OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spin Transfer in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructure Enabled by Direct Interlayer p-Orbital Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated efficient spin transfer across layers in the van der Waals heterostructure composed of WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, signaling a potential breakthrough in developing all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices. However, the reasons behind the unusually high interlayer spin transparency observed, despite the weak van der Waals interactions between layers, remain unclear. In this study, we employ density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method to explore this phenomenon. We find that the efficient cross-layer spin transfer arises from direct hybridization of p-orbitals between tellurium atoms at the interface. This interlayer orbital hybridization lowers the electronic potential barrier and significantly modifies the spin-polarized electronic structure of Fe3GeTe2. Consequently, an effective channel for spin-polarized transport is established between WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, leading to high interlayer spin transparency. Combining this enhanced spin transparency with the large spin Hall angle of WTe2 explains the high spin-orbit torque efficiency observed experimentally. Furthermore, we predict that applying a gate voltage can further increase this efficiency. Our findings offer a pathway for designing high-performance, all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of metalloborophene nanoribbons on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metalloborophene, characterized by the presence of metal-centered boron wheels denoted as M\c{opyright}Bn, has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its versatile properties and potential applications in fields such as electronics, spintronics, and catalysis. However, the experimental verification of metalloborophene has been challenging, mainly due to the unconventional two-dimensional (2D) boron networks. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and first-principles calculations to unveil Cu\c{opyright}B8 metalloborophene nanoribbons formed via spontaneous alloying after the deposition of boron on a heated Cu(110) substrate under ultrahigh vacuum condition. The thermodynamically preferred precursor, the anchoring of boron network to metal atoms, and anisotropic lattice mismatch are identified as pivotal factors in the formation of these metalloborophene nanoribbons. This discovery expands the repertoire of 2D materials and offers a potential pathway for the synthesis of other metalloborophenes.</description>

      <title>Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moir\'e patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>Bulk-like structural, magnetic and optical properties of (111)- and (001)-NiO thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have grown (111)- and (001)-oriented NiO thin films on (0001)-Sapphire and (001)-MgO substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), respectively. DC magnetic susceptibility measurements underline that the N\'eel temperatures of the samples are beyond room-temperature. This is further confirmed by the presence of two-magnon Raman scattering modes in these films in ambient conditions. Moreover, relative intensity of the two magnon-mode with respect to a neighboring phonon mode in the films, at least down to 30 nm thickness, is comparable to the same for bulk NiO. UV-vis spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry determined that the bandgap of the films is 3.6 eV which is well within the range for bulk NiO. Thus, these indicate that the thin films are bulk-like. Further, photoluminescence measurements on (111)-NiO films obtained two-radiative transitions at 385 and 405 nm. The linewidth of the latter broadens towards low temperatures, indicating a plausible exciton-magnon coupling. Overall, these PLD-grown oxide films hold significant technological importance due to their optical transparency and their capacity to host robust magnons at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization driven by molecular vibrations leads to enantioselectivity in chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality pervades multiple scientific domains-physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy-and profoundly influences their foundational principles. Recently, the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon has captured significant attention in physical chemistry due to its potential applications and intriguing underlying physics. Despite its prominence, the microscopic mechanisms of CISS remain hotly debated, hindering practical applications and further theoretical advancements. Here we challenge the established view that attributes CISS-related phenomena to current-induced spin polarization and electron transport across interfaces. We propose that molecular vibrations in chiral molecules primarily drive spin polarization, thereby governing CISS. Employing an electrochemical cell paired with a precisely engineered magnetic multilayer, we demonstrate that the magnetic interactions akin to interlayer exchange coupling are crucial for CISS. Our theoretical study suggests that molecular vibrations facilitate chirality-dependent spin polarization, which plays a pivotal role in CISS-related phenomena such as magnetoresistance and enantiomer separation using ferromagnets. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in the design and analysis of systems in various scientific fields, extending the role of spin dynamics from traditional areas such as solid-state physics to chemical reactions, molecular biology, and even drug discovery.</description>

      <title>NIR-to-NIR lifetime based thermometry with the thermally elongated luminescence kinetics driven by structural phase transition in LiYO2:Yb3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the various techniques used in luminescence thermometry, luminescence kinetics is considered the least sensitive to perturbations related to the optical properties of the medium containing the phosphor. For this reason, temperature sensing and imaging using lifetime-based luminescence thermometers is of high interest for wide range of specific applications. However, for most such thermometers, an increase in temperature leads to a shortening in lifetime, which can hinder the specificity and accuracy of the readout. In this work, we present an approach that utilizes a thermally induced increase in the symmetry of the host material associated with a structural phase transition in LiYO2:Yb3+. Consequently, the lifetime of the excited level 2F5/2 of the Yb3+ ion is thermally prolonged, achieving a relative sensitivity of 0.5%/K. The phase transition temperature can be controlled by adjusting the dopant concentration. Additionally, thermal changes in the emission spectrum enable the use of LiYO2:Yb3+ for ratiometric temperature readout with a relative sensitivity of 5.3%/K at 280K for LiYO2:5%Yb3+.</description>

      <title>Higher order potential in the modified convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe highly heterogeneous systems using the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the standard form of the thermodynamic potential with a constant coefficient in the gradient term and a polynomial of the fourth degree may not be sufficient. The modification of the form of the thermodynamic potential with a polynomial of the sixth degree and the quadratic dependence of the coefficient at the gradient term is considered. Exact solutions in the form of a moving static wave and the conditions of their existence depending on the symmetry of the potential are obtained.</description>

      <title>Evidence of spin reorientation transition below 150 K from magnetic force microscopy in a ferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic transitions in BiFeO$_3$ at low temperature (5-300 K) and observed nearly 90$^o$ rotation of magnetic domains (imaged by vertical magnetic force microscopy) across 150 K in an epitaxial thin film of thickness $\sim$36 nm. It offers a clear evidence of spin reorientation transition. It also corroborates the transition observed below $\sim$150 K in the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature data. The field-driven 180$^o$ domain switching at room temperature, on the other hand, signifies presence of ferromagnetism. Since bulk antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ does not exhibit such a transition, this observation in ferromagnetic thin film of BiFeO$_3$ indicates a radical effect because of epitaxial strain. Density functional theory based first-principles calculations too reveal that combined in- and out-of-plane epitaxial strain induces magnetic transition from G- to C-type structure in BiFeO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Persistent Spin Textures in Nonpolar Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have proposed a novel route for the realisation of persistent spin texture (PST). We have shown from symmetry considerations that in non-polar chiral systems, bands with specific orbital characters around a high symmetry point with $D_{2}$ little group may admit a single spin dependent term in the low energy $\bf{k.p}$ model Hamiltonian that naturally leads to PST. Considering a $2D$ plane in the Brillouin zone (BZ), we have further argued that in such chiral systems the PST is transpired due to the comparable strengths of the Dresselhaus and Weyl (radial) interaction parameters where the presence of these two terms are allowed by the $D{_2}$ symmetry. Finally using first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations we have identified that the non-polar chiral compounds Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and AsBr$_3$ displays PST for the conduction band and valence band respectively around the $\Gamma$ point having $D{_2}$ little group and predominantly Ta-$d_{xz}$ orbital character for Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and Br-$p{_x}$ orbital character for AsBr$_3$ corroborating our general strategy. Our results for the realisation of PST in non-polar chiral systems thereby broaden the class of materials displaying PST that can be employed for application in spin-orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio study of the beta Fe2O3 phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles results on the electronic and magnetic properties of the cubic bulk $\beta$-phase of iron(III) oxide (Fe$_2$O$_3$). Given that all Fe-Fe magnetic couplings are expected to be antiferromagnetic within this high-symmetry crystal structure, the system may exhibit some signature of magnetic frustration, making it challenging to identify its magnetic ground state. We have analyzed the possible magnetic phases of the $\beta$-phase among which there are ferrimagnets, altermagnets and Kramers antiferromagnets. While the $\alpha$-phase is an altermagnet and the $\gamma$-phase is a ferrimagnet, we conclude that the magnetic ground state for the bulk $\beta$-phase of Fe$_2$O$_3$ is a Kramers antiferromagnet, moreover, we find that close in energy there is a bulk d-wave altermagnetic phase. We report the density of states and the evolution band gap as a function of the electronic correlations, for suitable values of the Coulomb repulsion the system is a charge-transfer insulator with an indirect band gap of 1.5 eV. As the opposite to the $\gamma$-phase, the magnetic configuration between first-neighbor of the same kind is always antiferromagnetic while the magnetic configuration between Fe$_a$ and Fe$_b$ is ferro or antiferro. In this magnetic arrangement, first-neighbor interactions cancel out in the mean-field estimation of the N\'eel temperature, leaving second-neighbor magnetic exchanges as the primary contributors, resulting in a N\'eel temperature lower than that of other phases. Our work paves the way toward the ab initio study of nanoparticles and alloys for the $\beta$-phase of Fe$_2$O$_3$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and growth kinetics of Co/Gd bilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) exhibit a range of intriguing magnetic phenomena, including all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS), fast current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM), and the potential to act as orbital-to-spin angular momentum converters. For spintronic applications involving these materials, the Curie temperature is a crucial factor in determining not only the threshold energy for AOS, but also the material's resistance to temperature rise during CIDWM. However, the relationship between the Curie temperature, the thicknesses of the individual layers, and the specifics of the growth process remains an open question. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the Curie temperature of one of the archetype synthetic ferrimagnets with PMA, the Pt/Co/Gd trilayer, grown by DC magnetron sputtering and characterized with MOKE and SQUID. We provide an interpretation of the experiments we designed to address these outstanding questions through modeling of the deposition process and the induced magnetization at the Co/Gd interface. Our findings demonstrate that the Curie temperature and, by extension, the conditions for PMA and magnetic compensation, of these ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets are not only impacted by the interface quality, which can be influenced by the sputtering process, but also to a significant extent by finite-size effects in the 4f-material. This work offers new methods and understanding to predict and manipulate the critical temperature and magnetostatic properties of 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets for spintronic applications and magneto-photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Measurement of electron beam induced sample heating in SEM experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.</description>

      <title>Diamond-defect engineering of NV- centers using ion beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.</description>

      <title>Joint Approximate Diagonalization approach to Quasiparticle Self-Consistent $GW$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative route to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ calculations ($\mathrm{qs}GW$) on the basis of a Joint Approximate Diagonalization of the one-body $GW$ Green's functions $G(\varepsilon_n^{QP})$ taken at the input quasiparticle energies. Such an approach allows working with the full dynamical self-energy, without approximating the latter by a symmetrized static form as in the standard $\mathrm{qs}GW$ scheme. Calculations on the $GW$100 molecular test set lead nevertheless to a good agreement, at the 65 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect to the conventional $\mathrm{qs}GW$ approach. We show further that constructing the density matrix from the full Green's function as in the fully self-consistent $\mathrm{sc}GW$ scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle one-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between $\mathrm{qs}GW$ and $\mathrm{sc}GW$ approaches, closer to CCSD(T) reference values.</description>

Abstract: Formation of the intermediate phase patterns in the thin-film co-deposition process is simulated using the Stochastic Kinetic Mean-Field method and Monte Carlo. Three basic morphologies of the 2D sections are distinguished: (1) spots (rod-like in 3D), (2) layered structures-lamellae, zigzags, and labyrinths (plate-like in 3D), and (3) net-like structures (inverse to spot-like structures, when spots become majority and the surrounding matrix becomes a minority). They are characterized and distinguished with the help of only one special topological parameter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Theory of Linear Optical and Electro-Optic Properties of Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials underlie key optical technologies in optical communications, integrated optics and quantum computing. Yet, there is a lack of a consistent thermodynamic framework to predict the optical properties of ferroelectrics and the mutual connections among ferroelectric polarization, optical properties, and optical dispersion. For example, there is no existing thermodynamic model for establishing the relationship between the ferroelectric polarization and the optical properties in the visible spectrum. Here we present a thermodynamic theory of the linear optical and electro-optic properties of ferroelectrics by separating the lattice and electronic contributions to the total polarization. We introduce a biquadratic coupling between the lattice and electronic contributions validated by both first-principles calculations and experimental measurements. As an example, we derive the temperature and wavelength-dependent anisotropic optical properties of BaTiO3, including the full linear optical dielectric tensor and the linear electro-optic (Pockels) effect through multiple ferroelectric phase transitions, which are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data and first principles calculations. This general framework incorporates essentially all optical properties of materials, including coupling between the ionic and electronic order parameters, as well as their dispersion and temperature dependence, and thus offers a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing light-matter interactions in ferroelectrics-based optical devices.</description>

      <title>The morphology and interface structure of titanium on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defect chemistry and thermal oxidation of lanthanide (Ln) incorporated-UO2 are critical for understanding and predicting their behavior as enhanced fuels, mixed oxide (MOX) fuels, spent nuclear fuels (SNF), and particles for safeguard purposes. In this study, we independently controlled the Ln type (Ce4+, Nd3+, and Gd3+) and the preparation condition (reduced and nonreduced) to investigate their correlations to the generated non-equilibrated defects correspondingly. From early to late lanthanides: Ce and U formed close-to-ideal solid solutions in Fm-3m and oxidized to (Ce, U)4O9, Nd and U mixing under the reducing condition formed solid solutions with oxygen vacancies aggregating near Nd, and the mixing of smaller Gd with U resulted in short-range subnano-domain segregations with Ia-3 region embedded in the global Fm-3m matrix. Both trivalent Ln-incorporated UO2 oxidized to a mixture of (Ln, U)4O9 and (Ln, U)3O8. From these signature defect structures resulting from both Ln type and preparation condition, we proposed kinetic model and thermodynamic hypothesis for explaining the oxidation resistance of (Ln, U)O2. Although originated from f-block oxides, the discovery of long-range disorder short-range ordering may be not uncommon in other metal oxide systems, which can strongly influence their functionalities and properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of properties of materials at finite temperatures are computationally demanding and require models that are more efficient than the ab initio approaches. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) address this issue by enabling accurate models with close to ab initio accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the utility of ML models in capturing properties of realistic materials by performing finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations of perovskite oxides using a force field based on equivariant graph neural networks. The models demonstrate efficient learning from a small training dataset of energies, forces, stresses, and tensors of Born effective charges. We qualitatively capture the temperature dependence of the dielectric tensor and structural phase transitions in calcium titanate.</description>

      <title>Understanding the origin of superconducting dome in electron-doped MoS$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) monolayer across a broad doping range, successfully recreating the so far unresolved superconducting dome. Our first-principles findings reveal several dynamically stable phases across the doping-dependent phase diagram. We observe a doping-induced increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, followed by a reduction in $T_c$ due to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs), polaronic distortions, and structural transition from the H to the 1T$'$ phase.

      <title>Damping Enhancement in YIG at Millikelvin Temperatures due to GGG Substrate</title>

Abstract: Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural compatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below 50$\,$K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping in a 97$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick GGG substrate at temperatures down to 30$\,$mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase in FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic field generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate. Numerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth enhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and frequencies above 18$\,$GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous Gilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the damping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Orbital anomalous Hall effect in the few-layer Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation of the linear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the nonmagnetic Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. This is achieved by applying a direct current Idc and an alternating current Iac (Iac&lt;&lt;Idc) in TaIrTe4, where the former induces time-reversal symmetry breaking and the latter probes the triggered AHE. The anomalous Hall resistance VacH/Iac shows a linear dependence on Idc and changes sign with the polarity of Idc. In temperature-dependent measurements, VacH/Iac also experiences a sign reversal at 100 K, consistent with the temperature-dependent nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Furthermore, in measurements involving only dc transport, the dc Hall voltage exhibits a quadratic relationship with Idc. When the Idc direction is reversed, the Hall resistance changes sign, demonstrating a colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect (NRHE). Our theoretical calculations suggest that the observed linear AHE, NLHE, and NRHE all dominantly originate from the current-induced orbital magnetization compared to the minor spin contribution. This work provides deep insights into the orbital magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear Hall response, promising precise electric control of out-of-plane polarized orbit flow.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin and orbital Edelstein effect in WTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials with spin-momentum locked spin textures, such as Rashba states and topological surface states, the current-induced shift of the Fermi contour in the k space leads to spin polarization, known as the Edelstein effect, which depends linearly on the applied current. However, its nonlinear counterpart has not yet been discovered. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear Edelstein effect in few-layer WTe2. Under a current bias, an out-of-plane magnetization is induced in WTe2, which is electrically probed using an Fe3GeTe2 electrode, a van der Waals ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Notably, with an applied ac at frequency {\omega}, an induced magnetization with second-harmonic response at frequency 2{\omega} is observed, and its magnitude demonstrates a quadratic dependence on the applied current, characteristic of the nonlinear Edelstein effect. This phenomenon is well explained by the current-induced orbital magnetization via the Berry connection polarizability tensors in WTe2. The orbital degree of freedom plays the primary role in the observed nonlinear Edelstein effect, that is, the nonlinear orbital Edelstein effect. This can, in turn, give rise to a nonlinear spin Edelstein effect through spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport plays a vital role in probing the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons, valley chirality, and carrier scattering mechanisms. The nonlinear Hall effect, characterized by a nonlinear scaling of Hall voltage with longitudinal current, has been explored to reveal the Berry curvature and quantum metric related physics. In this work, we extend the study of nonlinear transport to spin and valley degrees of freedom. Using bilayer graphene devices with Fe3GeTe2 contacts, we observe a second-order nonlinear spin current exhibiting spin valve-like behaviors. By tracking magnetic moment precession under an in-plane magnetic field, we identify a significantly enhanced critical magnetic field required for in-plane rotation, suggesting out-of-plane valley polarization induced by ferromagnetic proximity. These findings offer deep insights into the interplay of valley and spin in second-order nonlinear transport, opening avenues for promising device applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping delocalization of impurity bands across archetypal Mott-Anderson transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring charge transport in solids on demand is the overarching goal of condensed-matter research as it is crucial for electronic applications. Yet, often the proper tuning knob is missing and extrinsic factors such as impurities and disorder impede coherent conduction. Here we control the very buildup of an electronic band from impurity states within the pseudogap of ternary Fe$_{2-x}$V$_{1+x}$Al Heusler compounds via reducing the Fe content. Our density functional theory calculations combined with specific heat and electrical resistivity experiments reveal that, initially, these states are Andersonlocalized at low V concentrations $0 &lt; x &lt; 0.1$. As x increases, we monitor the formation of mobility edges upon the archetypal Mott-Anderson transition and map the increasing bandwidth of conducting states by thermoelectric measurements. Ultimately, delocalization of charge carriers in fully disordered V$_3$Al results in a resistivity exactly at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit that is perfectly temperature-independent up to 700 K - more constant than constantan.</description>

      <title>Successive magnetic transitions in the spin-5/2 easy-axis triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$: A neutron diffraction study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of various exotic quantum states in the equilateral triangular-lattice phosphates Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2 and Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $S$ = 1, the magnetic properties of spin-5/2 antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$, their classical counterpart, are comprehensively investigated experimentally. DC magnetization and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples indicate two successive magnetic transitions at $T\rm_{N1}$ $\approx$ 1.13 K and $T\rm_{N2}$ $\approx$ 1.28 K, respectively. Zero-field neutron powder diffraction measurement at 67 mK reveals a Y-like spin configuration as its ground-state magnetic structure, with both the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis components of the Mn$^{2+}$ moments long-range ordered. The incommensurate magnetic propagation vector $k$ shows a dramatic change for the intermediate phase between $T\rm_{N1}$ and $T\rm_{N2}$, in which the spin state is speculated to change into a collinear structure with only the $c$-axis moments ordered, as stabilized by thermal fluctuations. The successive magnetic transitions observed in Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ are in line with the expectation for a triangle-lattice antiferromagnet with an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Sliding or Rolling? Characterizing single-particle contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contacts between particles in dense, sheared suspensions are believed to underpin much of their rheology. Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up new ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.</description>

Abstract: In a recent advance, Nb3Cl8 two-dimensional crystals with a kagome lattice and electronic topological flat bands has been experimentally fabricated (Nano Lett. 2022, 22, 4596). In this work motivated by the aforementioned progress, we conduct first-principles calculations to explore the structural, phonon dispersion relations, single-layer exfoliation energies and mechanical features of the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanosheets. Acquired phonon dispersion relations reveal the dynamical stability of the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) monolayers. In order to isolate single-layer crystals from bulk counterparts, we predicted exfoliation energies of 0.24, 0.27 and 0.28 J/m2, for the Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers, respectively, which are noticeably lower than that of the graphene. We found that the Nb3X8 monolayers are relatively strong nanosheets with isotropic elasticity and anisotropic tensile strength. It is moreover shown that by increasing the atomic weight of halogen atoms in the Nb3X8 nanosheets, mechanical characteristics decline. Presented results provide a useful vision about the key physical properties of novel 2D systems of Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I).</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.</description>

      <title>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by Sub-chiral Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator, are dictated to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant matrix, the sub-chiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without chiral symmetry but with sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.</description>

Abstract: The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO) and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Interaction and kinetics of H2, CO2, and H2O on Ti3C2Tx MXene probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: One of the most explored MXenes is Ti3C2Tx, where Tx is designated to inherently form termination species. Among many applications, Ti3C2Tx is a promising material for energy storage, energy conversion, and CO2-capturing devices. However, active sites for adsorption and surface reactions on the Ti3C2Tx-surface are still open questions to explore, which have implications for preparation methods when to obtain correct and optimized surface requirements. Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the adsorption of common gas molecules such as H2, CO2, and H2O, which all may be present in energy storage, energy converting, and CO2-capturing devices based on Ti3C2Tx. The study shows that H2O, with a strong bonding to the Ti-Ti bridge-sites, can be considered as a termination species. An O and H2O terminated Ti3C2Tx-surface restricts the CO2 adsorption to the Ti on-top sites and may reduce the ability to store positive ions, such as Li+ and Na+. On the other hand, an O and H2O terminated Ti3C2Tx-surface shows the capability to split water. The results from this study have implications for the correct selection of MXene preparations and the environment around the MXene in different implementations, such as energy storage, CO2-capturing, energy conversion, gas sensing, and catalysts.</description>

      <title>Magnetic critical phenomena and low temperature re-entrant spin-glass features of Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy</title>

Abstract: A detailed investigation of the structural and magnetic properties, including magnetocaloric effect, re-entrant spin-glass behavior at low temperature, and critical behavior in polycrystalline Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy is reported. The prepared alloy crystallizes in a cubic CsCl-type crystal structure with Pm-3m space group. The temperature-dependent magnetization data reveals a second-order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition ($\sim$ 122.9 K), which is further supported by the analysis of the magnetocaloric effect. The isothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the studied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange interactions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the critical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic susceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\delta$ = 4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type ferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with distance as J(r) $\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the AC susceptibility data suggests that the frequency-dependent shifting of the peak temperatures is well explained using standard dynamic scaling laws such as the critical slowing down model and Vogel-Fulcher law, and confirms the signature of re-entrant spin-glass features in Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy. Furthermore, maximum magnetic entropy change of $\sim$ 1.92 J/kg-K and relative cooling power of $\sim$ 496 J/kg at 50 kOe applied magnetic field are determined from magnetocaloric studies that are comparable to those of other Mn-Fe-Al systems.</description>

      <title>In situ etching of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using tert-butyl chloride in an MOCVD system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate in situ etching of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system using tert-Butyl chloride (TBCl). We report the successful etching of both heteroepitaxial (-201)-oriented and homoepitaxial (010)-oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films over a wide range of substrate temperature, TBCl molar flows, and reactor pressures. We identify that the likely etchant is HCl (g) formed by the pyrolysis of TBCl in the hydrodynamic boundary layer above the substrate. The temperature dependence of the etch rate reveals two distinct regimes characterized by markedly different apparent activation energies. The extracted apparent activation energies suggest that at temperatures below ~800 {\deg}C the etch rate is likely limited by desorption of etch products. The relative etch rates of heteroepitaxial (-201) and homoepitaxial (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were observed to scale by the ratio of the surface energies indicating an anisotropic etch. For (010) homoepitaxial films, relatively smooth post-etch surface morphology was achieved by tuning the etching parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic fluctuations of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering technique is employed to investigate the paramagnetic spin dynamics in a single crystalline sample of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$. In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\times T_{C}$ to 1.5$\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin fluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model predictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar interactions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that vanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\,K). Based on the characteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we determine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above room temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based magnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning both $v_{F}$ and $m$ to improve the TE properties of the NLSs. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observe that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. We also find that in all TE metrics, the type-I NLS surprisingly can surpass the type-II NLS, which seems counter-intuitive to the fact that within the two-band model, the type-I NLS contains a parabolic band while the type-II NLS possesses a higher-order, Mexican-hat band. Our study demonstrates that optimizing the curvature of energy bands by tuning $v_F$ can significantly improve the TE performance of NLSs. This approach could guide future efforts in exploring other semimetals as potential TE materials by manipulating their band structures.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmonic generation in 2D materials: comparison of different strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to generate new frequencies, is a key phenomenon in modern photonic systems. However, a major challenge with these techniques lies in the difficulty of tuning the nonlinear electrical susceptibilities that drive such effects in a given material. As a result, dynamic control of optical nonlinearities has remained largely confined to research laboratories, limiting its practical use as a spectroscopic tool. In this work, we aim to advance the development of devices with tunable nonlinear responses by exploring two potential mechanisms for electrically manipulating second-order optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials. Specifically, we consider two configurations: in the first, the material does not inherently exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), but this response is induced by an external field; in the second, an external field induces doping in a material that already exhibits SHG, altering the intensity of the nonlinear signal. In this work, we have studied these two configurations using a real-time ab-initio approach under an out-of-plane external field and including the effects of doping-induced variations in the screened electron-electron interaction. We then discuss the limitations of current computational methods and compare our results with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Diamine Surface Passivation and Post-Annealing Enhance Performance of Silicon-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the use of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) as a chemical modifier at the perovskite/electron-transport layer (ETL) interface enhances the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7 eV bandgap FACs mixed-halide perovskite single-junction cells, primarily by boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.06 V to 1.15 V. Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60 evaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to the DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence microscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional homogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents detrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with formamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a larger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at the interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we fabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for control devices. Our study underscores the critical role of chemical reactivity and thermal post-processing of the C60/Lewis-base passivator interface in minimizing device losses and advancing solar-cell performance of wide-bandgap mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite for tandem application.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Studies on Sodium Storage Mechanism in Hard Carbon Anodes of Sodium-Ion Batteries: Molecular Simulations Based on Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention in recent years as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their low cost, abundant sodium resources, and excellent cycling performance. Hard carbon materials, characterized by their high specific capacity, outstanding cycling stability, and low cost, have emerged as potential candidates for SIB anodes. However, the sodium storage mechanism in hard carbon anodes remains highly complex, especially in disordered structures, and is yet to be fully understood. To address this, we employed relative machine learning force fields (MLFFs) in conjunction with multiscale simulation techniques to systematically investigate the sodium storage behavior in hard carbon. By integrating simulations, this study provides a detailed exploration of sodium adsorption, intercalation, and filling mechanisms. High-precision, large-scale simulations reveal the dynamic behavior and distribution patterns of sodium ions in hard carbon. The findings not only deepen our understanding of sodium storage mechanisms in hard carbon anodes, but also offer a theoretical foundation for optimizing future SIB designs, while introducing novel simulation methodologies and technical frameworks to enhance battery performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of aluminas through machine learning interatomic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aluminum oxide (alumina, Al$_2$O$_3$) exists in various structures and has broad industrial applications. While the crystal structure of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is well-established, those of transitional aluminas remain highly debated. In this study, we propose a universal machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for aluminas, trained using the neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach. The dataset is constructed through iterative training and farthest point sampling, ensuring the generation of the most representative configurations for an exhaustive sampling of the potential energy surface. The accuracy and generality of the potential are validated through simulations under a wide range of conditions, including high temperatures and pressures. A phase diagram is presented that includes both transitional aluminas and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ based on the NEP. We also successfully extrapolate the phase diagram of aluminas under extreme conditions ([0, 4000] K and [0, 200] GPa ranges of temperature and pressure, respectively), while maintaining high accuracy in describing their properties under more moderate conditions. Furthermore, combined with our developed structure search workflow, the NEP provides an evaluation of existing $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ structure models. The NEP developed in this work enables highly accurate dynamic simulations of various aluminas on larger scales and longer timescales, while also offering new insights into the study of transitional aluminas structures.</description>

      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

Abstract: The development of systems to measure and optimize emerging energetic material performance is critical for CWA defeat. This study documents a combination of two spectroscopic systems designed to monitor decomposition of a CWA simulant and temperature. The first system is a custom benchtop Polygonal Rotating Mirror Infrared Spectrometer (PRiMIRS) incorporating a fully customizable sample cell to observe decomposition of DIMP as it interacts with combusting composite metal particles. The second is TDLAS used to monitor increases in background gas temperatures as the composite metal powders combust. The PRiMIRS system demonstrates a very high SNR at Hz, reasonable SNR when operating at 100 Hz, and capabilities of resolving spectral features with a FWHM resolution of 15 cm^-1. TDLAS was able to monitor temperature rises between room temperature and 230C +/- 5C at 100 Hz.For testing, liquid DIMP was inserted in a preheated SS cell to generate DIMP vapor and (Al-8Mg):Zr metal powders were ignited in a SS mount with a resistively heated nichrome wire at one end of the cell. The ignited particles propagated across the cell containing DIMP vapor. The path averaged gas temperature in the preheated SS cell rises rapidly (100ms) and decays slowly (&lt; 5 s) but remains below 230C during particle combustion, a temperature at which the thermal decomposition of DIMP is not observed over similarly short timescales (seconds). However, when combusting particles were introduced to the DIMP vapor (heterogenous environment), spectral signatures indicative of decomposition products such as IMP and IPA were observed within seconds.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>

Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they are simply MD trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are physically indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gr\"uneisen rule in cubic rare-earth cage systems : the examples of LaB$_6$ and LaPt$_{4}$Ge$_{12}$</title>

Abstract: In some intermetallic compounds, the crystallographic structure allows for an unusual latitude of movement of lanthanide ions inside so-called cages. Examples of such magnetic cage systems include the rare-earth hexaborides RB6 and filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 series. In both instances, the rare-earth site, at the center of the cage, is of high symmetry, which may preserve some degree of orbital degeneracy. A deviation from the cage center lifts this degeneracy, yielding an interplay between the rare-earth movement and the system properties in the paramagnetic range. In particular, the low temperature thermal expansion should reflect this cage-specific crystal field contribution. This study presents an experimental investigation of the thermal expansion in the paramagnetic range of some elements in the aforementioned series. From a simple model for the vibrations in cage systems, a description of the phononic thermal expansion is proposed, within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Accounting for this non-magnetic contributions helps discern the influence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperature.</description>
