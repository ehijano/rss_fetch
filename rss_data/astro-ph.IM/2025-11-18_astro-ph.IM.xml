      <title>Towards Mitigating Systematics in Large-Scale Surveys via Few-Shot Optimal Transport-Based Feature Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematics contaminate observables, leading to distribution shifts relative to theoretically simulated signals-posing a major challenge for using pre-trained models to label such observables. Since systematics are often poorly understood and difficult to model, removing them directly and entirely may not be feasible. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that aligns learned features between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by optimizing a feature-alignment loss on the representations extracted from a pre-trained ID model. We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys. Our code is available at https://github.com/sultan-hassan/feature-alignment-for-OOD-generalization.</description>

      <title>KDP as a thermal blocking filter - Deep near IR observations with a warm narrow band filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\mu$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\mu$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\mu$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths &gt;2$\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1.191$\mu$m, and interpret it as the airglow continuum. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.</description>

      <title>High-impact Scientific Software in Astronomy and its creators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, scientific software has graduated from a hidden side-product to a first-class member of the astrophysics literature. We aim to quantify the activity and impact of software development for astronomy, using a systematic survey. Starting from the Astrophysics Source Code Library and the Journal of Open Source Software, we analyse 3432 public git-based scientific software packages. Paper abstract text analysis suggests seven dominant themes: cosmology, data reduction pipelines, exoplanets, hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer spectra simulation, statistical inference and galaxies. We present key individual software contributors, their affiliated institutes and countries of high-impact software in astronomy &amp; astrophysics. We consider the number of citations to papers using the software and the number of person-days from their git repositories, as proxies for impact and complexity, respectively. We find that half of the mapped development is through US-affiliated institutes, and a large number of high-impact projects are led by a single person. Our results indicate that there are currently over 200 people active on any given day to improve software in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Implications of Mini-EUSO measurements for a space-based observation of UHECRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini--EUSO (Multiwavelength Imaging New Instrument for the Extreme Universe Space Observatory, known as \emph{UV atmosphere} in the Russian Space Program) is the first mission of the JEM-EUSO program on board the International Space Station. It was launched in August 2019 and it is operating since October 2019 being located in the Russian section (Zvezda module) of the station and viewing our planet from a nadir-facing UV-transparent window. The instrument is based on the concept of the original JEM-EUSO mission and consists of an optical system employing two Fresnel lenses of 25 cm each and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with single photon counting sensitivity and an overall field of view of 44$^\circ \times $44$^\circ$. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the near UV range (predominantly between 290 nm and 430 nm), with a spatial resolution of about 6~km and different temporal resolutions of 2.5~$\mu$s, 320~$\mu$s and 41 ms. Mini-EUSO observations are extremely important to better assess the potential of a space-based detector in studying Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) such as K-EUSO and POEMMA. In this contribution we focus the attention on the results of the UV measurements and we place them in the context of UHECR observations from space, namely the estimation of exposure for the planned M-EUSO (Multi-messenger Extreme Universe Space Observatory) mission.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 5: Structured Summaries and Concept Extraction for 400,000 Astrophysics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dataset of 408,590 astrophysics papers from arXiv (astro-ph), spanning 1992 through July 2025. Each paper has been processed through a multi-stage pipeline to produce: (1) structured summaries organized into six semantic sections (Background, Motivation, Methodology, Results, Interpretation, Implication), and (2) concept extraction yielding 9,999 unique concepts with detailed descriptions. The dataset contains 3.8 million paper-concept associations and includes semantic embeddings for all concepts. Comparison with traditional ADS keywords reveals that the concepts provide denser coverage and more uniform distribution, while analysis of embedding space structure demonstrates that concepts are semantically dispersed within papers-enabling discovery through multiple diverse entry points. Concept vocabulary and embeddings are publicly released at https://github.com/tingyuansen/astro-ph_knowledge_graph.</description>

      <title>The X-$\gamma$ detector onboard the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA mission designed to study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos from a balloon platform. Serving as a precursor to the planned POEMMA satellite mission, PBR will be launched aboard a NASA Super Pressure Balloon for a flight at of 33 km altitude in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. The unique conditions of low pressure and high altitude will enable in-situ observations of High-Altitude Horizontal Air Showers (HAHAs), a poorly understood class of nearly horizontal Extensive Air Showers induced by cosmic rays skimming the Earth's atmosphere without reaching the ground. Due to the lower atmospheric grammage at these altitudes, HAHAs develop more gradually compared to typical downward-going EASs, with interaction lengths on the order of 100 km. This slow development allows balloon-borne instruments to probe the early stages of cosmic ray shower evolution. At these early stages, high-energy electrons and positrons from the electromagnetic component of the shower can generate X-rays and gamma rays via synchrotron radiation. The X-$\gamma$ detector onboard PBR is designed to measure these photons across a broad energy range. The instrument consists of four sub-detectors, each optimized for different overlapping energy bandfrom tens of keV to MeV. The current design utilizes CsI(Tl)/NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals coupled with SiPMs for photon detection. To suppress background noise, the detectors are enclosed within an anti-coincidence system to reject charged particle events. The X-$\gamma$ detector is aligned with PBR's primary instruments, the Fluorescence Camera and the Cherenkov Camera, within a 30$^\circ$ field of view, overlapping with both imaging cameras. It will operate in a triggered mode, with the possibility to receive signals from the other instruments to check for simultaneous events.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Multi-Channel Imager--Instrument Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), a two-meter aperture astronomical space telescope under China's manned space program, is equipped with multiple back-end scientific instruments. As an astronomical precision measurement module of the CSST, the Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) can cover a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to near-infrared with three-color simultaneous high-precision photometry and imaging, which meets the scientific requirements for various fields. The diverse scientific objectives of MCI require not only a robust airborne platform, advanced optical systems, and observing facilities but also comprehensive software support for scientific operations and research. To this end, it is essential to develop realistic observational simulation software to thoroughly evaluate the MCI data stream and provide calibration tools for future scientific investigations. The MCI instrument simulation software will serve as a foundation for the development of the MCI data processing pipeline and will facilitate improvements in both hardware and software, as well as in the observational operation strategy, in alignment with the mission's scientific goals. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of the MCI instrument simulation and some corresponding performances of the MCI data processing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field Spectrograph--Instrument Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV facility renowned for its wide field of view, high image quality, and multi-band observational capabilities. Among the five instruments onboard the CSST, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) offers the unique ability to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information across a field of view of no less than $6^{''}\times6^{''}$. Key advantages of the IFS include a high spatial resolution of $0.2^{''}$ and a broad spectral coverage from 350 to 1000 nm, making it an ideal instrument for studying physical processes in the vicinity of supermassive black holes within galaxies. To more accurately assess the technical and scientific performance of the CSST-IFS, it is essential to develop a simulation tool that incorporates realistic effects from all optical components. Such a simulation will form an integral part of the CSST-IFS data and pipeline system, enabling the development of the data reduction pipeline well ahead of actual observations. This paper presents an end-to-end simulation workflow for the CSST-IFS, incorporating a wide range of instrumental effects that may influence its spectral and imaging performance. The simulation accounts for optical diffraction effects introduced by all components, such as image slicers and slit array, as well as sub-pixel effects from gratings. It also includes various detector noises, frame-shifting effects, and charge-transfer inefficiency. Real observational conditions--such as target Doppler shift, cosmic rays, and other in-orbit operational effects--are also considered. We describe the technical implementation of the simulation and present results that quantitatively characterize key instrument parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermal infrared characterization of spatially unresolved resident space objects: Prospects from analytical two-component modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations. Last, we comment on promising prospects of this model for applications to existing and future space telescope observations to characterize RSOs from spatially unresolved photometry</description>

      <title>Wide-Field X-ray Polarimetry for High Energy Astronomical Transients: First results of the pathfinder CXPD Cubesat Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low Energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is a key component of the next-generation large-scale Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter, POLAR-2. It is designed for polarization observations of transient sources in the soft X-ray energy range with a wide field of view (FOV). To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy.</description>

      <title>Natural gradient descent for improving variational inference based classification of radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are most commonly optimised with first-order optimisers such as stochastic gradient descent. However, when optimising for parameters of probabilistic models, incorporating second order information during optimisation can lead to a more direct path in the distribution space and faster convergence. In this work we examine whether using natural gradient descent can improve the performance of variational inference based classification of radio galaxies. We use the Improved Variational Online Newton (iVON) algorithm and compare its performance against a recent benchmark for BNNs for radio galaxy classification. We find that iVON results in better uncertainty calibration out of all the methods previously considered while providing similar predictive performance to the best performing inference methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop based variational inference. Models trained with iVON can distinguish far out-of-distribution optical galaxy data, but they cannot reliably detect radio galaxy images from a telescope with different resolution and sensitivity. We find that the cold posterior effect persists in the models trained with iVON. Our results suggest that the choice of the optimiser can lead to qualitatively different solutions and future work using probabilistic neural network models should carefully consider the inductive biases being encoded through the optimisation process, in addition to the data, architecture and inference method.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XX. Haute Couture: Spectral stitching of JWST MIRI-IFU cubes with matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Modeling X-ray photon pile-up with a normalizing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic range of imaging detectors flown on-board X-ray observatories often only covers a limited flux range of extrasolar X-ray sources. The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.</description>

      <title>Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET). Protocol Version 1.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET) project is a CUISINES exoplanet model intercomparison project (exo-MIP) that compares various energy balance models (EBMs) through a series of numerical experiments. The objective is to establish rigorous protocols that enable the identification of intrinsic differences among EBMs that could lead to model-dependent results for past, current, and future EBM studies. Such efforts also provide the community with an EBM ensemble average and standard deviation, rather than a single model prediction, on benchmark cases typically used by EBM studies. These experiments include Earth-like planets at different obliquity, instellation, and carbon dioxide abundance. Here we update the v1.0 protocol (Deitrick et al., 2023) to accommodate the requirements of previously untested community models. In particular, we expand the range of carbon dioxide abundances for Experiment 4 to ensure any code will capture both snowball and ice-free end states. Additionally, participants are now required to report two ice edge latitudes per hemisphere to fully distinguish all climate states (snowball, ice caps, ice belts, and ice-free). The outputs described in FILLET protocol version 1.0 have also now been revised to include the maximum and minimum ice extent, in latitude, for each hemisphere, as well as the diffusion coefficient and outgoing longwave radiative flux.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we first reviewed the traditional astrolabe design methods and identified potential sources of manufacturing error. We then proposed an analytical approach using computer assistance to develop designs for the astrolabe components. This approach marks a pioneering step toward designing and producing a physical astrolabe model aided by computer technology. Our goal was to revive this significant heritage instrument while leveraging modern techniques and software to produce astrolabe models free from traditional manufacturing inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>From the Virgo interferometer calibration to the bias and uncertainty of the h(t) detector strain during the O4 run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first gravitational wave detection in 2015, ground-based interferometer sensitivities have significantly improved, requiring highly precise calibration to ensure accurate reconstruction of the h(t) strain signal. In this talk we will outline the Virgo interferometer calibration steps performed in preparation of the O4b run started in April 2024. We will first describe the Photon Calibrator power devices intercalibration allowing for a 0.48% precision on mirror displacement. Before explaining how the Photon Calibrator is used to calibrate every Virgo mirror actuators. We will also discuss the monitoring of the h(t) strain reconstruction during the run showing that, on the 10 Hz to 2 kHz band, the reconstructed strain achieves a precision of 2% in modulus and 30 mrad in phase. Special emphasis will be given on the newly developed frequency-dependent bias and uncertainty computation method and the resulting online unbiasing of the h(t) strain.</description>

      <title>Auto-encoder model for faster generation of effective one-body gravitational waveform approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $\chi_1(z)$, $\chi_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\,M_{\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\,M_{\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\%/10\% train/validation split, while 20\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $\chi_{\rm eff}\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.</description>

      <title>IdentYS: A Python-Based Tool for Identifying Young Stars in Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on young stellar populations is essential to understand the properties of embedded clusters and advance theories of their formation. This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.</description>

      <title>From Images to Physics: Probabilistic Inference of Galaxy Parameters and Emission Lines via VAE &amp; Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)--Normalizing Flow (NF) framework for rapid probabilistic inference of galaxy properties and emission line fluxes at $z \leq 0.3$ from SDSS \textit{gri} imaging and photometry. Our model probabilistically infers stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), redshift, gas-phase metallicity, and central black hole mass for a given galaxy. The model accruacy matches current non-spectroscopic methods for stellar mass and redshift, surpasses them for SFR and metallicity, and introduces the first probabilistic central black hole mass estimates from imaging + photometry. It also delivers probabilistic estimates of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [N~\textsc{ii}], and [O~\textsc{iii}] emission line fluxes directly from imaging, enabling SFR, metallicity, dust, and AGN/shock diagnostics without spectroscopy. This approach opens new pathways for scalable, physics-informed inference in upcoming surveys such as Roman and Rubin LSST.</description>

      <title>The Great January Comet of 1910 (C/1910 A1): A Key Opportunity Missed by New Zealand Astronomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C/1910 A1 was one of the Great Comets of the twentieth century. Although it was widely observed from the Northern Hemisphere, it was first discovered by observers south of the Equator. The comet arrived just months before the widely anticipated apparition of Comet 1P/Halley and was significantly more spectacular. As a result, the two comets were confused, and many who, in later years, talked about how prominent Comet 1P/Halley was in 1910 were often remembering C/1910 A1. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed search through historical records and media publications in Aotearoa / New Zealand, to investigate how extensively C/1910 A1 was observed from New Zealand. We compare our results with observations reported for Comet 1P/Halley later in 1910, finding that surprisingly few observations of C/1910 A1 were made by New Zealand observers. We discuss cases where the comet was misidentified as being an early sighting of 1P/Halley and compare the observations made in New Zealand with international observations/records/accounts. We find that, although the Great January Comet of 1910 was observed from New Zealand, it was witnessed by few compared to other parts of the world, meaning that the apparition of C/1910 A1 was something of a missed opportunity for New Zealand astronomers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconstruction of Matched-Filter SNR Time Series from Nearby Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for efficiently searching long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\gtrsim 25\%$. With a truncation threshold of $10^{-3}$ applied to the ratio waveform amplitudes, the storage requirement is reduced by a factor of $\sim 60$ relative to storing the full template bank.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting periodic or sharp fast-time features in the supernova neutrino lightcurve with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.
  A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($&gt;25\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($&gt;50\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5\sigma$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.</description>

      <title>Towards an anomaly detection pipeline for gravitational waves at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Spectral component imaging of solar X-ray flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar hard X-ray observations provide diagnostics of the hottest plasmas and of nonthermal electron populations present during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. HXR images of specific energy ranges often contain overlapping contributions of these components, complicating their interpretation. This is even more challenging as HXR imagers generally use an indirect imaging system. Our work aims to separately image individual spectral components, such as thermal loops, superhot sources, and nonthermal footpoint sources, rather than obtaining images of specific energy ranges that show a combination of all components. We introduce a new method called spectral component imaging and apply it to observations provided by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. First, the flare integrated HXR spectrum is fitted with individual spectral components to get the relative contributions of each component in each native STIX energy channel. In a second step, a set of linear equations is created based on these weights and the observed, energy-dependent STIX visibilities. The visibilities of the individual spectral components are derived by means of a linear least-squares approach and are subsequently utilized for image reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral component imaging on four different flares observed by STIX. This method provides powerful diagnostics, particularly for flares with hot and superhot components, allowing us to spatially separate these two thermal components. We apply our methodology to the nonthermal peak of the X7.1 flare SOL2024-10-01, and we find that the superhot component is located 4.8 Mm away from the hot thermal loops. The thermal energy of the superhot component is approximately 20% of the energy content of the hot component, highlighting the significance of superhot components in the total flare energy budget.</description>

      <title>Variable-temperature attenuator calibration method for on-wafer microwave noise characterization of low-noise amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-noise cryogenic microwave amplifiers are widely used in applications such as radio astronomy and quantum computing. On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.</description>

      <title>In-orbit background and sky survey simulation study of POLAR-2/LPD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station (CSS) deployment in early 2024. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) prompt emission in the energy range of 2-10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90 degrees in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit a high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts/cm^2/s on average, and it varies with the detector's orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristic for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.</description>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) presents a significant challenge for carrying out precision measurements in radio astronomy. In particular, RFI can be a showstopper when looking for faint cosmological signals such as the red-shifted 21-cm line from cosmic dawn (CD) and epoch of reionization (EoR). As wireless communications, satellite transmissions, and other RF technologies proliferate globally, understanding the RFI landscape has become essential for site selection and data integrity. We present findings from RFI surveys conducted at four distinct locations: three locations in India, the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory in Karnataka, Twin Lakes in Ladakh, Kalpong Dam in the Andaman Islands, and the Gruvebadet Atmosphere Laboratory in Ny-{\AA}lesund, Svalbard, Norway. These sites, selected based on their geographical diversity and varying levels of human activity, were studied to assess RFI presence in 30-300 MHz bands, critical for low-frequency observations and experiments targeting the 21-cm CD/EoR signal. Using an automated RFI detection approach via the Hampel filter and singular value decomposition, the surveys identified both persistent and transient interference, which varies with location and time. The results provide a comprehensive view of the RFI environment at each site, informing the feasibility of long-term cosmological observations and aiding in the mitigation of RFI in radio astronomical data. The methods developed to characterize RFI can be easily generalized to any location and experiment.</description>

      <title>TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys-the Slitless Spectroscopy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST), slated to become China's largest space-based optical telescope in the coming decade, is designed to conduct wide-field sky surveys with high spatial resolution. Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ginnungagap is a fully parallel (MPI+OpenMP) code designed to generate cosmological initial conditions for simulations involving very large numbers of particles. It operates in several modes, including the creation of initial conditions with either uniform or spatially varying resolution (for "zoom-in" simulations). The initial conditions can be fully random or derived by extending the resolution of existing ones while preserving the large-scale structures. Ginnungagap is open source and modular, consisting of a collection of independent tools that can be used for a variety of tasks. In this paper, we describe the main features of Ginnungagap and present test results for different types of simulations prepared with it.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Scientific Computing through LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search: A Case Study in Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing faces fundamental challenges: vast design spaces with expensive evaluations, domain-specific physical constraints requiring expert knowledge, and the necessity for interpretable solutions that scientists can validate and understand. We present the Evo-MCTS (Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search) framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with tree-structured evolutionary search for interpretable algorithm discovery. Evo-MCTS combines reflective code synthesis leveraging LLM domain knowledge, multi-scale evolutionary operations on structured code representations, and interpretable algorithmic pathways emerging from tree-guided exploration. When applied to gravitational wave detection-a challenging domain with continuous parameter spaces and strict physical constraints-Evo-MCTS achieves 20.2% improvement over domain-specific methods and 59.1% over LLM-based optimization frameworks. This improvement arises from its ability to consistently converge toward interpretable algorithmic structures that integrate multiple functional components. Our domain-agnostic architecture establishes a generalizable methodology for automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing, where algorithmic transparency and physical validity are as essential as performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Probing Time-Dependent Physics with Phase-Folding CMB Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.</description>
