      <title>Learning from the electronic structure of molecules across the periodic table</title>

Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Representation of Time-Evolving Neural Network-based Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is pivotal for modeling non-adiabatic electron dynamics, a key process in ultrafast spectroscopy and laser-matter interactions. However, exact solutions to the TDSE remain computationally prohibitive for most realistic systems, as the Hilbert space expands exponentially with dimensionality. In this work, we propose an approach integrating the stochastic representation framework with a neural network wavefunction ansatz, a flexible model capable of approximating time-evolving quantum wavefunctions. We first validate the method on one-dimensional single-electron systems, focusing on ionization dynamics under intense laser fields, a critical process in attosecond physics. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately reproduces key features of quantum evolution, including the energy and dipole evolution during ionization. We further show the feasibility of extending this approach to three-dimensional systems. Due to the increased complexity of real-time simulations in higher dimensions, these results remain at an early stage and highlight the need for more advanced stabilization strategies.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods for Modeling the Photochemistry of Diazirine and Diazo Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diazirines and diazo compounds are widely employed as photoreactive precursors for generating carbenes, key intermediates in chemical biology and materials science. However, computationally modeling their reaction pathways remains challenging due to a need for large active spaces and the requirement to accurately capture excited-state surfaces along with transition states and conical intersections. In this work, we utilize a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for investigating carbene formation in representative diazirine-diazomethane systems. Our approach leverages Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended variant (Ext-SQD) for ground and excited-state analysis, combined with classical tools for geometry optimization, active-space selection, and diagnostic evaluation. Quantum computations were carried out on superconducting quantum processors, and results for both aliphatic and aryl-substituted diazirine-diazomethane pairs were benchmarked against established classical methods, including DFT, CCSD, CASCI, and SCI. SQD achieves accuracy surpassing the chemical accuracy threshold for nearly all stationary points on the potential energy surface of parent diazirine relative to the CASCI(12,10) reference, and remains close to chemical accuracy for phenyl-substituted diazirine in a (30,30) active space, with an average deviation of 1.1 kcal/mol relative to the SCI benchmark. SQD closely follows CASCI and SCI trends, showing consistent agreement. The findings demonstrate the promise of quantum computing frameworks in modeling photochemical transformations of electronically complex and pharmacologically relevant molecules.</description>

      <title>Flexible Uncertainty Calibration for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for developing machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in predictive atomistic simulations. Conformal prediction (CP) is a statistical framework that constructs prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage under minimal assumptions, making it an attractive tool for UQ. However, existing CP techniques, while offering formal coverage guarantees, often lack accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to the complexity of atomic environments. In this work, we present a flexible uncertainty calibration framework for MLIPs, inspired by CP but reformulated as a parameterized optimization problem. This formulation enables the direct learning of environment-dependent quantile functions, producing sharper and more adaptive predictive intervals at negligible computational cost. Using the foundation model MACE-MP-0 as a representative case, we demonstrate the framework across diverse benchmarks, including ionic crystals, catalytic surfaces, and molecular systems. Our results show order-of-magnitude improvements in uncertainty-error correlation, enhanced data efficiency in active learning, and strong generalization performance, together with reliable transfer of calibrated uncertainties across distinct exchange-correlation functionals. This work establishes a principled and data-efficient approach to uncertainty calibration in MLIPs, providing a practical route toward more trustworthy and transferable atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient spectra from atomistic simulation: a generalized master equation study of the air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing condensed phase spectra from atomistic simulations requires calculating correlation functions from molecular dynamics and can be very expensive. A totally general, data-driven method to reduce cost is to employ an exact rewriting to a generalized master equation characterized by a memory kernel. The decay time of the kernel can be less than the original function, reducing the amount of data required. In this paper we construct the minimal projection operator to predict vibrational sum-frequency generation spectra and apply it to the air-water interface simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. We are able to obtain a modest reduction in cost of just under 50\%. We explore various avenues to use more of the available data to expand the projector in an attempt to reduce the cost further. Interestingly, we are not able to effect any change by including quadrupoles, inter-molecular couplings, or a depth-dependence. How to strategically go about maximally reducing cost using projection operators remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Macro-Dipole-Constrainted Learning of Atomic Charges for Accurate Electrostatic Potentials at Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large thermal fluctuations of the liquid phase obscure the weak macroscopic electric field that drives electrochemical reactions, rendering the extraction of reliable interfacial charge distributions from ab initio molecular dynamics extremely challenging. We introduce SMILE-CP (Scalar Macro-dipole Integrated LEarning - Charge Partitioning), a macro-dipole-constrained scheme that infers atomic charges using only the instantaneous atomic coordinates and the total dipole moment of the simulation cell - quantities routinely available from standard density-functional theory calculations. SMILE-CP preserves both the global electrostatic field and the local potential without invoking any explicit charge-partitioning scheme. Benchmarks on three representative electrochemical interfaces - nanoconfined water, Mg2+ dissolution in water, and a kinked Mg vicinal surface under anodic bias - show that SMILE-CP eliminates the qualitative errors observed for unconstrained charge decompositions. The method is computationally inexpensive and data-efficient, opening the door to charge-aware machine-learning potentials capable of bias-controlled, nanosecond-scale simulations of realistic electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Template-free precision synthesis of biphilic microdome arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biphilic microdome arrays are ubiquitous in nature, but their synthetic counterparts have been scarce. To bridge that gap, we leverage condensed droplet polymerization (CDP) to enable their template-free synthesis. During CDP, monomer droplets serve as microreactors for free-radical polymerization. The droplet diameter is monitored in real time. To enable the precise prediction of the convex geometric parameters, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates geometric arguments, scaling analysis, and kinetic theories. The model accurately predicts the dimensions of the as-synthesized microdome arrays, pointing to unprecedented precision in the synthesis of such topography. To illustrate its impact, the methodology is used to enable biphilic microdomes with targeted dimensions, for the reduction of surface colonization by a biofilm-forming pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Importantly, the reduction is achieved with a moderately hydrophobic surface that has been considered prone to fouling, pointing to a fresh material design strategy and broadened palette of synthetic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Classical and multiscale non-equilibrium thermodynamics have different histories and different objectives. In this Note we explain the differences and review some topics in which the multiscale viewpoint of mesoscopic time evolution of macroscopic systems helped to advance the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Eventually, we illustrate the Braun-Le Chatelier principle in dissipative thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Large Differences Between Stochastic and Deterministic Kinetics in a Simple Autocatalytic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In small systems, quantitative discrepancies between stochastic and deterministic descriptions of chemical kinetics can be significant, with their magnitude depending on the specific reaction network. Here, we study the Finke-Watzky model-an irreversible autocatalysis, A + B -- &gt; 2B, supplemented by an irreversible first-order process, A -- &gt; B. This model has been used to describe the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and protein misfolding and aggregation, but it may also serve as a minimal model for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. We show that, for certain parameter values, exceptionally large deviations can arise between stochastic and deterministic kinetics of the Finke-Watzky model. Moreover, its stochastic time evolution may be highly sensitive to initial conditions. These properties are retained in the generalization of the model to reversible reactions. To quantify the differences between the predictions of deterministic and stochastic kinetics, we derive the explicit analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watzky model. This solution also allows us to derive analogous solutions for two related reaction networks: A + A -- &gt; A + B, A -- &gt; B, and A + A -- &gt; A + B, A + B -- &gt; 2B. Our findings may have implications for modeling epidemics and intracellular chemical processes, and more broadly for models of population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the ionization potential condition for localized electron removal in density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal tuning of functional parameters in density functional theory approximations, based on enforcing the ionization potential theorem, has emerged as the method of choice for the non-empirical prediction of the electronic structure of finite systems. This method has recently been extended to the bulk limit, based on an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from a localized Wannier orbital. This Wannier-localization based optimal tuning method has been shown to be highly successful for a wide range of periodic systems, accurately predicting electronic and optical properties. However, a rigorous theoretical justification for its foundational ansatz has been lacking. Here, we establish an ionization potential condition for the removal of a localized electron, by extending the piecewise linearity and Janak's theorems in density functional theory. We also provide numerical evidence supporting our theory.</description>

      <title>Metatensor and metatomic: foundational libraries for interoperable atomistic machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques into atomic-scale modeling has proven to be an extremely effective strategy to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational cost of simulations. It also entails conceptual and practical challenges, as it involves combining very different mathematical foundations, as well as software ecosystems that are very well developed in their own merit, but do not share many commonalities. To address these issues and facilitate the adoption of ML in atomistic simulations, we introduce two dedicated software libraries. The first one, metatensor, provides multi-platform and multi-language storage and manipulation of arrays with many potentially sparse indices, designed from the ground up for atomistic ML applications. By combining the actual values with metadata that describes their nature and that facilitates the handling of geometric information and gradients with respect to the atomic positions, metatensor provides a common framework to enable data sharing between ML software -- typically written in Python -- and established atomistic modeling tools -- typically written in Fortran, C or C++. The second library, metatomic, provides an interface to store an atomistic ML model and metadata about this model in a portable way, facilitating the implementation, training and distribution of models, and their use across different simulation packages. We showcase a growing ecosystem of tools, from low-level libraries, training utilities, to interfaces with existing software packages that demonstrate the effectiveness of metatensor and metatomic in bridging the gap between traditional simulation software and modern ML frameworks.</description>

      <title>Intramolecular Singlet Fission Through a Coherently Coupled Excimer-like Intermediate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of electronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF dimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details. Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway. 2D cross-peaks directly identify the two Davydov components of the dimer along with strongly wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics depending on which Davydov component is excited, implicating a coherently coupled intermediate that mediates iSF. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1 photoproduct suggest that inter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive the ~200 fs evolution towards an excimer-like intermediate and its subsequent ~2 ps relaxation to the TT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks electronic motion during these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal electronic reorientation with significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the nuclear evolution away from the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The observations of coherent excimer-like intermediate and significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the iSF process need to be carefully accounted for in the synthetic design and electronic structure models for iSF dimers aiming for long-lived high-spin correlated triplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13449v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

      <title>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences. We publicly provide the documented and validated solver framework.</description>
