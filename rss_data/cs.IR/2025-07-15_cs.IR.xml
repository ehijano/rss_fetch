      <title>Overview of the TREC 2023 deep learning track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set, based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO (human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach, which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$. However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4 were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.</description>

      <title>GraphRunner: A Multi-Stage Framework for Efficient and Accurate Graph-Based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are common in text-based applications. However, they struggle with structured, interconnected datasets like knowledge graphs, where understanding underlying relationships is crucial for accurate retrieval. A common direction in graph-based retrieval employs iterative, rule-based traversal guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Such existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop traversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and hallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.
  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based retrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning, verification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that enable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic traversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined traversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations before execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and detects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench dataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while reducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x, making it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>DS@GT at Touch\'e: Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong conversational abilities. In this Working Paper, we study them in the context of debating in two ways: their ability to perform in a structured debate along with a dataset of arguments to use and their ability to evaluate utterances throughout the debate. We deploy six leading publicly available models from three providers for the Retrieval-Augmented Debate and Evaluation. The evaluation is performed by measuring four key metrics: Quality, Quantity, Manner, and Relation. Throughout this task, we found that although LLMs perform well in debates when given related arguments, they tend to be verbose in responses yet consistent in evaluation.

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation Explanation Generation with Hierarchical Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Recommender System (ExRec) provides transparency to the recommendation process, increasing users' trust and boosting the operation of online services. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), whose extensive world knowledge and nuanced language understanding enable the generation of human-like, contextually grounded explanations, LLM-powered ExRec has gained great momentum. However, existing LLM-based ExRec models suffer from profile deviation and high retrieval overhead, hindering their deployment. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation Explanation Generation with Hierarchical Aggregation (REXHA). Specifically, we design a hierarchical aggregation based profiling module that comprehensively considers user and item review information, hierarchically summarizing and constructing holistic profiles. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient retrieval module using two types of pseudo-document queries to retrieve relevant reviews to enhance the generation of recommendation explanations, effectively reducing retrieval latency and improving the recall of relevant reviews. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by up to 12.6% w.r.t. the explanation quality while achieving high retrieval efficiency.</description>

      <title>Correcting the LogQ Correction: Revisiting Sampled Softmax for Large-Scale Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-tower neural networks are a popular architecture for the retrieval stage in recommender systems. These models are typically trained with a softmax loss over the item catalog. However, in web-scale settings, the item catalog is often prohibitively large, making full softmax infeasible. A common solution is sampled softmax, which approximates the full softmax using a small number of sampled negatives.
  One practical and widely adopted approach is to use in-batch negatives, where negatives are drawn from items in the current mini-batch. However, this introduces a bias: items that appear more frequently in the batch (i.e., popular items) are penalized more heavily.
  To mitigate this issue, a popular industry technique known as logQ correction adjusts the logits during training by subtracting the log-probability of an item appearing in the batch. This correction is derived by analyzing the bias in the gradient and applying importance sampling, effectively twice, using the in-batch distribution as a proposal distribution. While this approach improves model quality, it does not fully eliminate the bias.
  In this work, we revisit the derivation of logQ correction and show that it overlooks a subtle but important detail: the positive item in the denominator is not Monte Carlo-sampled - it is always present with probability 1. We propose a refined correction formula that accounts for this. Notably, our loss introduces an interpretable sample weight that reflects the model's uncertainty - the probability of misclassification under the current parameters. We evaluate our method on both public and proprietary datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over the standard logQ correction.</description>

      <title>Balancing Semantic Relevance and Engagement in Related Video Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Related video recommendations commonly use collaborative filtering (CF) driven by co-engagement signals, often resulting in recommendations lacking semantic coherence and exhibiting strong popularity bias. This paper introduces a novel multi-objective retrieval framework, enhancing standard two-tower models to explicitly balance semantic relevance and user engagement. Our approach uniquely combines: (a) multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly optimize co-engagement and semantic relevance, explicitly prioritizing topical coherence; (b) fusion of multimodal content features (textual and visual embeddings) for richer semantic understanding; and (c) off-policy correction (OPC) via inverse propensity weighting to effectively mitigate popularity bias. Evaluation on industrial-scale data and a two-week live A/B test reveals our framework's efficacy. We observed significant improvements in semantic relevance (from 51% to 63% topic match rate), a reduction in popular item distribution (-13.8% popular video recommendations), and a +0.04% improvement in our topline user engagement metric. Our method successfully achieves better semantic coherence, balanced engagement, and practical scalability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Item-centric Exploration for Cold Start Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems face a critical challenge in the item cold-start problem, which limits content diversity and exacerbates popularity bias by struggling to recommend new items. While existing solutions often rely on auxiliary data, but this paper illuminates a distinct, yet equally pressing, issue stemming from the inherent user-centricity of many recommender systems. We argue that in environments with large and rapidly expanding item inventories, the traditional focus on finding the "best item for a user" can inadvertently obscure the ideal audience for nascent content. To counter this, we introduce the concept of item-centric recommendations, shifting the paradigm to identify the optimal users for new items. Our initial realization of this vision involves an item-centric control integrated into an exploration system. This control employs a Bayesian model with Beta distributions to assess candidate items based on a predicted balance between user satisfaction and the item's inherent quality. Empirical online evaluations reveal that this straightforward control markedly improves cold-start targeting efficacy, enhances user satisfaction with newly explored content, and significantly increases overall exploration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Does UMBRELA Work on Other LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reproduce the UMBRELA LLM Judge evaluation framework across a range of large language models (LLMs) to assess its generalizability beyond the original study. Our investigation evaluates how LLM choice affects relevance assessment accuracy, focusing on leaderboard rank correlation and per-label agreement metrics. Results demonstrate that UMBRELA with DeepSeek V3 obtains very comparable performance to GPT-4o (used in original work). For LLaMA-3.3-70B we obtain slightly lower performance, which further degrades with smaller LLMs.</description>

      <title>Criteria-Based LLM Relevance Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance judgments are crucial for evaluating information retrieval systems, but traditional human-annotated labels are time-consuming and expensive. As a result, many researchers turn to automatic alternatives to accelerate method development. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a scalable solution by generating relevance labels directly through prompting. However, prompting an LLM for a relevance label without constraints often results in not only incorrect predictions but also outputs that are difficult for humans to interpret. We propose the Multi-Criteria framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, decomposing the notion of relevance into multiple criteria--such as exactness, coverage, topicality, and contextual fit--to improve the robustness and interpretability of retrieval evaluations compared to direct grading methods. We validate this approach on three datasets: the TREC Deep Learning tracks from 2019 and 2020, as well as LLMJudge (based on TREC DL 2023). Our results demonstrate that Multi-Criteria judgments enhance the system ranking/leaderboard performance. Moreover, we highlight the strengths and limitations of this approach relative to direct grading approaches, offering insights that can guide the development of future automatic evaluation frameworks in information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Identifying Offline Metrics that Predict Online Impact: A Pragmatic Strategy for Real-World Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge in recommender systems is to establish reliable relationships between offline and online metrics that predict real-world performance. Motivated by recent advances in Pareto front approximation, we introduce a pragmatic strategy for identifying offline metrics that align with online impact. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to simultaneously serve multiple test groups, each with distinct offline performance metrics, in an online experiment controlled by a single model. The method is model-agnostic for systems with a neural network backbone, enabling broad applicability across architectures and domains. We validate the strategy through a large-scale online experiment in the field of session-based recommender systems on the OTTO e-commerce platform. The online experiment identifies significant alignments between offline metrics and real-word click-through rate, post-click conversion rate and units sold. Our strategy provides industry practitioners with a valuable tool for understanding offline-to-online metric relationships and making informed, data-driven decisions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training costs.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric Graph Convolution for Re-ranking in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph knowledge has been proven effective in enhancing item rankings in recommender systems (RecSys), particularly during the retrieval stage. However, its application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual information in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A major challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with repeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in distributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to scale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first demonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking qualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the substantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively expensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a non-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only during test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational overheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural knowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a plug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of various ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced computational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy yields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with little to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

      <title>SLIF-MR: Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) and multimodal item information, which respectively capture relational and attribute features, play a crucial role in improving recommender system accuracy. Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Fine-Grained Paper-to-Paper Retrieval with Multi-Aspect-Aware Query Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple, fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then, experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3% over existing retrieval baselines.</description>

      <title>User Long-Term Multi-Interest Retrieval Model for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User behavior sequence modeling, which captures user interest from rich historical interactions, is pivotal for industrial recommendation systems. Despite breakthroughs in ranking-stage models capable of leveraging ultra-long behavior sequences with length scaling up to thousands, existing retrieval models remain constrained to sequences of hundreds of behaviors due to two main challenges. One is strict latency budget imposed by real-time service over large-scale candidate pool. The other is the absence of target-aware mechanisms and cross-interaction architectures, which prevent utilizing ranking-like techniques to simplify long sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework named User Long-term Multi-Interest Retrieval Model(ULIM), which enables thousand-scale behavior modeling in retrieval stages. ULIM includes two novel components: 1)Category-Aware Hierarchical Dual-Interest Learning partitions long behavior sequences into multiple category-aware subsequences representing multi-interest and jointly optimizes long-term and short-term interests within specific interest cluster. 2)Pointer-Enhanced Cascaded Category-to-Item Retrieval introduces Pointer-Generator Interest Network(PGIN) for next-category prediction, followed by next-item retrieval upon the top-K predicted categories. Comprehensive experiments on Taobao dataset show that ULIM achieves substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods, and brings 5.54% clicks, 11.01% orders and 4.03% GMV lift for Taobaomiaosha, a notable mini-app of Taobao.</description>

      <title>Riding the Carousel: The First Extensive Eye Tracking Analysis of Browsing Behavior in Carousel Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carousels have become the de-facto interface in online services. However, there is a lack of research in carousels, particularly examining how recommender systems may be designed differently than the traditional single-list interfaces. One of the key elements for understanding how to design a system for a particular interface is understanding how users browse. For carousels, users may browse in a number of different ways due to the added complexity of multiple topic defined-lists and swiping to see more items.
  Eye tracking is the key to understanding user behavior by providing valuable, direct information on how users see and navigate. In this work, we provide the first extensive analysis of the eye tracking behavior in carousel recommenders under the free-browsing setting. To understand how users browse, we examine the following research questions : 1) where do users start browsing, 2) how do users transition from item to item within the same carousel and across carousels, and 3) how does genre preference impact transitions?
  This work addresses a gap in the field and provides the first extensive empirical results of eye tracked browsing behavior in carousels for improving recommenders. Taking into account the insights learned from the above questions, our final contribution is to provide suggestions to help carousel recommender system designers optimize their systems for user browsing behavior. The most important suggestion being to reorder the ranked item positions to account for browsing after swiping.These contributions aim not only to help improve current systems, but also to encourage and allow the design of new user models, systems, and metrics that are better suited to the complexity of carousel interfaces.</description>

      <title>Am I on the Right Track? What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the reasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a "tool") when answering a question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our work is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used to inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.</description>

      <title>Analysing Health Misinformation with Advanced Centrality Metrics in Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of health misinformation on online social networks (OSNs) during global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to public health, social stability, and institutional trust. Centrality metrics have long been pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in the context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and dynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the limitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares three novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health misinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC). These metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered network interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and novel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and misinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential nodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42 combined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health misinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to 62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the proposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant Medical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation discussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics generalised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured by traditional methods. In general, the findings suggest that a combination of traditional and novel centrality measures offers a more robust and generalisable framework for understanding and mitigating the spread of health misinformation in different online network contexts.</description>

      <title>Infinite Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge. This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning, effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets, considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching.

      <title>Knowledge Conceptualization Impacts RAG Efficacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly, generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is, investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss their impact and implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights, uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability across diverse application domains</description>

      <title>Generative Cognitive Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation. Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability. In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model (G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from response prediction through a well-designed generation process that incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$ speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems.

      <title>Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval beyond RGB Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance. Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources, including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year, achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model. Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics, such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage student perseverance</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual learning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn multiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight Consolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic consolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this problem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating EWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST benchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how different approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability. Our results confirm what was shown in previous research, showing that EWC significantly reduces forgetting compared to naive training while slightly compromising learning efficiency on new tasks. Moreover, we investigate the impact of dropout regularization and varying hyperparameters, offering insights into the generalization of EWC across diverse learning scenarios. These results underscore EWC's potential as a viable solution for lifelong learning in neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of recommendation systems (RSs) in alleviating the information overload problem. As a new paradigm of RSs, session-based recommendation (SR) specializes in users' short-term preference capture and aims to provide a more dynamic and timely recommendation based on the ongoing interacted actions. In this survey, we will give a comprehensive overview of the recent works on SR. First, we clarify the definitions of various SR tasks and introduce the characteristics of session-based recommendation against other recommendation tasks. Then, we summarize the existing methods in two categories: sequential neural network based methods and graph neural network (GNN) based methods. The standard frameworks and technical are also introduced. Finally, we discuss the challenges of SR and new research directions in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a cutting-edge approach in sequential recommendation, leveraging historical interactions to model dynamic user preferences. Current methods mainly focus on learning processed recommendation data in the form of sequence-to-sequence text. While effective, they exhibit three key limitations: 1) failing to decouple intra-user explicit features (e.g., product titles) from implicit behavioral patterns (e.g., brand loyalty) within interaction histories; 2) underutilizing cross-user collaborative filtering (CF) signals; and 3) relying on inefficient reflection update strategies. To address this, We propose MoRE (Mixture of REflectors), which introduces three perspective-aware offline reflection processes to address these gaps. This decomposition directly resolves Challenges 1 (explicit/implicit ambiguity) and 2 (CF underutilization). Furthermore, MoRE's meta-reflector employs a self-improving strategy and a dynamic selection mechanism (Challenge 3) to adapt to evolving user preferences. First, two intra-user reflectors decouple explicit and implicit patterns from a user's interaction sequence, mimicking traditional recommender systems' ability to distinguish surface-level and latent preferences. A third cross-user reflector captures CF signals by analyzing user similarity patterns from multiple users' interactions. To optimize reflection quality, MoRE's meta-reflector employs a offline self-improving strategy that evaluates reflection impacts through comparisons of presence/absence and iterative refinement of old/new versions, with a online contextual bandit mechanism dynamically selecting the optimal perspective for recommendation for each user.

      <title>Interpret the Internal States of Recommendation Model with Sparse Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Recommendation model interpretation aims to reveal models' calculation process, enhancing their transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness by clarifying the relationships between inputs, model activations, and outputs. However, the complex, often opaque nature of deep learning models complicates interpretation, and most existing methods are tailored to specific model architectures, limiting their generalizability across different types of recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose RecSAE, an automated and generalizable probing framework that interprets Recommenders with Sparse AutoEncoder. It extracts interpretable latents from the internal states of recommendation models and links them to semantic concepts for interpretation. RecSAE does not alter original models during interpretation and also enables targeted de-biasing to models based on interpreted results. Specifically, RecSAE operates in three steps: First, it probes activations before the prediction layer to capture internal representations. Next, the RecSAE module is trained on these activations with a larger latent space and sparsity constraints, making the RecSAE latents more mono-semantic than the original model activations. Thirdly, RecSAE utilizes a language model to construct concept descriptions with confidence scores based on the relationships between latent activations and recommendation outputs. Experiments on three types of models (general, graph-based, and sequential) with three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of RecSAE framework. The interpreted concepts are further validated by human experts, showing strong alignment with human perception. Overall, RecSAE serves as a novel step in both model-level interpretations to various types of recommenders without affecting their functions and offering the potential for targeted tuning of models.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Usefulness Labeling for IR Evaluation</title>

Abstract: In the information retrieval (IR) domain, evaluation plays a crucial role in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents. In the recent LLM era, research has been conducted to automate document relevance labels, as these labels have traditionally been assigned by crowd-sourced workers - a process that is both time and consuming and costly. This study focuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that considers the user's search intents and task objectives, an aspect where relevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and document-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are essential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i) pre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the comprehensive search task session, (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better judgement in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts. Additionally, we investigated whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence between relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to identify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In conclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating critical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling: BIM Command Recommendation Based on Large-scale Usage Logs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and model-based design within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has been hindered by the perception that using BIM authoring tools demands more effort than conventional 2D drafting. To enhance design efficiency, this paper proposes a BIM command recommendation framework that predicts the optimal next actions in real-time based on users' historical interactions. We propose a comprehensive filtering and enhancement method for large-scale raw BIM log data and introduce a novel command recommendation model. Our model builds upon the state-of-the-art Transformer backbones originally developed for large language models (LLMs), incorporating a custom feature fusion module, dedicated loss function, and targeted learning strategy. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to over 32 billion rows of real-world log data collected globally from the BIM authoring software Vectorworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn universal and generalizable modeling patterns from anonymous user interaction sequences across different countries, disciplines, and projects. When generating recommendations for the next command, our approach achieves a Recall@10 of approximately 84%.

      <title>Towards Two-Stage Counterfactual Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) aims to learn a ranking policy from user interactions while correcting for the inherent biases in interaction data, such as position bias. Existing CLTR methods assume a single ranking policy that selects top-K ranking from the entire document candidate set. In real-world applications, the candidate document set is on the order of millions, making a single-stage ranking policy impractical. In order to scale to millions of documents, real-world ranking systems are designed in a two-stage fashion, with a candidate generator followed by a ranker. The existing CLTR method for a two-stage offline ranking system only considers the top-1 ranking set-up and only focuses on training the candidate generator, with the ranker fixed. A CLTR method for training both the ranker and candidate generator jointly is missing from the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a two-stage CLTR estimator that considers the interaction between the two stages and estimates the joint value of the two policies offline. In addition, we propose a novel joint optimization method to train the candidate and ranker policies, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a CLTR estimator and learning method for two-stage ranking. Experimental results on a semi-synthetic benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint CLTR method over baselines.</description>

      <title>Modeling Item-Level Dynamic Variability with Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing solutions for bundle recommendation(BR) have achieved remarkable effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles. However, bundle-item(B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit', may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user pes or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR models. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about 4%.Codes and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDiffBR.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Context-Awareness and Popularity Calibration on Popularity Bias in POI Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-of-interest (POI) recommender systems help users discover relevant locations, but their effectiveness is often compromised by popularity bias, which disadvantages less popular, yet potentially meaningful places. This paper addresses this challenge by evaluating the effectiveness of context-aware models and calibrated popularity techniques as strategies for mitigating popularity bias. Using four real-world POI datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla, and Yelp), we analyze the individual and combined effects of these approaches on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias. Our results reveal that context-aware models cannot be considered a uniform solution, as the models studied exhibit divergent impacts on accuracy and bias. In contrast, calibration techniques can effectively align recommendation popularity with user preferences, provided there is a careful balance between accuracy and bias mitigation. Notably, the combination of calibration and context-awareness yields recommendations that balance accuracy and close alignment with the users' popularity profiles, i.e., popularity calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past year, Generative Recommendations (GRs) have undergone substantial advancements, especially in leveraging the powerful sequence modeling and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance overall recommendation performance. LLM-based GRs are forming a new paradigm that is distinctly different from discriminative recommendations, showing strong potential to replace traditional recommendation systems heavily dependent on complex hand-crafted features. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of LLM-based GRs. Initially, we outline the general preliminaries and application cases of LLM-based GRs. Subsequently, we introduce the main considerations when LLM-based GRs are applied in real industrial scenarios. Finally, we explore promising directions for LLM-based GRs. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the GR domain.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantity Retrieval from Text:An Approach via Description Parsing and Weak Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments, supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing advanced medical imaging retrieval systems is challenging due to the varying definitions of `similar images' across different medical contexts. This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.</description>

      <title>SymRAG: Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Retrieval Through Adaptive Query Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems use uniform processing, causing inefficiency as simple queries consume resources similar to complex multi-hop tasks. We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG's neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures, and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</description>

      <title>Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative AI framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using RAG, Prompt engineering, and Cross-modal fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors,and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate dropout risks in global education systems</description>

      <title>DTECT: Dynamic Topic Explorer &amp; Context Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer &amp; Context Tracker), an end-to-end system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/DTECT.</description>
