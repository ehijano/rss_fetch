      <title>Denoising Sphere-Valued Data by Relaxed Total Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circle- and sphere-valued data play a significant role in inverse problems like magnetic resonance phase imaging and radar interferometry, in the analysis of directional information, and in color restoration tasks. In this paper, we aim to restore $(d-1)$-sphere-valued signals exploiting the classical anisotropic total variation on the surrounding $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. For this, we propose a novel variational formulation, whose data fidelity is based on inner products instead of the usually employed squared norms. Convexifying the resulting non-convex problem and using ADMM, we derive an efficient and fast numerical denoiser. In the special case of binary (0-sphere-valued) signals, the relaxation is provable tight, i.e. the relaxed solution can be used to construct a solution of the original non-convex problem. Moreover, the tightness can be numerically observed for barcode and QR code denoising as well as in higher dimensional experiments like the color restoration using hue and chromaticity and the recovery of SO(3)-valued signals.</description>

      <title>Quasi-interpolators with application to postprocessing in finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design quasi-interpolation operators based on piecewise polynomial weight functions of degree less than or equal to $p$ that map into the space of continuous piecewise polynomials of degree less than or equal to $p+1$. We show that the operators have optimal approximation properties, i.e., of order $p+2$. This can be exploited to enhance the accuracy of finite element approximations provided that they are sufficiently close to the orthogonal projection of the exact solution on the space of piecewise polynomials of degree less than or equal to $p$. Such a condition is met by various numerical schemes, e.g., mixed finite element methods and discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin methods. Contrary to well-established postprocessing techniques which also require this or a similar closeness property, our proposed method delivers a conforming postprocessed solution that does not rely on discrete approximations of derivatives nor local versions of the underlying PDE. In addition, we introduce a second family of quasi-interpolation operators that are based on piecewise constant weight functions, which can be used, e.g., to postprocess solutions of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. Another application of our proposed operators is the definition of projection operators bounded in Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A superfast direct inversion method for the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct solver is introduced for solving overdetermined linear systems involving nonuniform discrete Fourier transform matrices. Such a matrices can be transformed into a Cauchy-like form that has hierarchical low rank structure. The rank structure of this matrix is explained, and it is shown that the ranks of the relevant submatrices grow only logarithmically with the number of columns of the matrix. A fast rank-structured hierarchical approximation method based on this analysis is developed, along with a hierarchical least-squares solver for these and related systems. This result is a direct method for inverting nonuniform discrete transforms with a complexity that is nearly linear with respect to the degrees of freedom in the problem. This solver is benchmarked against various iterative and direct solvers in the setting of inverting the one-dimensional type-II (or forward) transform,for a range of condition numbers and problem sizes (up to $4\times 10^6$ by $2\times 10^6$). These experiments demonstrate that this method is especially useful for large ill-conditioned problems with multiple right-hand sides.</description>

      <title>Sturcture-preserving weighted BDF2 methods for Anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard model: uniform/variable-time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we innovatively develop uniform/variable-time-step weighted and shifted BDF2 (WSBDF2) methods for the anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model, combining the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach with two types of stabilized techniques. Using the concept of $G$-stability, the uniform-time-step WSBDF2 method is theoretically proved to be energy-stable. Due to the inapplicability of the relevant G-stability properties, another technique is adopted in this work to demonstrate the energy stability of the variable-time-step WSBDF2 method. In addition, the two numerical schemes are all mass-conservative.Finally, numerous numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of these schemes.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation and generative algorithms for three applications in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three applications of central interest in finance, we demonstrate the relevance of numerical algorithms based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) techniques. Three use cases are investigated. First, we show that extrapolating from few pricer examples leads to sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient results so that our algorithm can serve as a pricing framework. The second use case concerns reverse stress testing, which is formulated as an inversion function problem and is treated here via an optimal transport technique in combination with the notions of kernel-based encoders, decoders, and generators. Third, we show that standard techniques for time series analysis can be enhanced by using the proposed generative algorithms. Namely, we use our algorithm in order to extend the validity of any given quantitative model. Our approach allows for conditional analysis as well as for escaping the `Gaussian world'. This latter property is illustrated here with a portfolio investment strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we plan to show an eigenvalue algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices by using the idea of non-commutative integrable systems and matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. We introduce adjacent families of matrix-valued $\theta$-deformed bi-orthogonal polynomials, and derive corresponding discrete non-commutative hungry Toda lattice from discrete spectral transformations for polynomials. It is shown that this discrete system can be used as a pre-precessing algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices. Besides, some convergence analysis and numerical examples of this algorithm are presented.</description>

      <title>ODE-DPS: ODE-based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems in Partial Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years we have witnessed a growth in mathematics for deep learning, which has been used to solve inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, most deep learning-based inversion methods either require paired data or necessitate retraining neural networks for modifications in the conditions of the inverse problem, significantly reducing the efficiency of inversion and limiting its applicability. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, leveraging the score-based generative diffusion model, we introduce a novel unsupervised inversion methodology tailored for solving inverse problems arising from PDEs. Our approach operates within the Bayesian inversion framework, treating the task of solving the posterior distribution as a conditional generation process achieved through solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of inversion results, we propose an ODE-based Diffusion Posterior Sampling inversion algorithm. The algorithm stems from the marginal probability density functions of two distinct forward generation processes that satisfy the same Fokker-Planck equation. Through a series of experiments involving various PDEs, we showcase the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>QR Decomposition of Dual Matrices and its Application to Traveling Wave Identification in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix decompositions in dual number representations have played an important role in fields such as kinematics and computer graphics in recent years. In this paper, we present a QR decomposition algorithm for dual number matrices, specifically geared towards its application in traveling wave identification, utilizing the concept of proper orthogonal decomposition. When dealing with large-scale problems, we present explicit solutions for the QR, thin QR, and randomized QR decompositions of dual number matrices, along with their respective algorithms with column pivoting. The QR decomposition of dual matrices is an accurate first-order perturbation, with the Q-factor satisfying rigorous perturbation bounds, leading to enhanced orthogonality. In numerical experiments, we discuss the suitability of different QR algorithms when confronted with various large-scale dual matrices, providing their respective domains of applicability. Subsequently, we employed the QR decomposition of dual matrices to compute the DMPGI, thereby attaining results of higher precision. Moreover, we apply the QR decomposition in the context of traveling wave identification, employing the notion of proper orthogonal decomposition to perform a validation analysis of large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for brain functional circuits. Our approach significantly improves the identification of two types of wave signals compared to previous research, providing empirical evidence for cognitive neuroscience theories.</description>

      <title>Splitting Techniques for DAEs with port-Hamiltonian Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the simulation of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), it is essential to employ numerical schemes that take into account the inherent structure and maintain explicit or hidden algebraic constraints without altering them. This paper focuses on operator-splitting techniques for coupled systems and aims at preserving the structure in the port-Hamiltonian framework. The study explores two decomposition strategies: one considering the underlying coupled subsystem structure and the other addressing energy-associated properties such as conservation and dissipation. We show that for coupled index-$1$ DAEs with and without private index-2 variables, the splitting schemes on top of a dimension-reducing decomposition achieve the same convergence rate as in the case of ordinary differential equations. Additionally, we discuss an energy-associated decomposition for index-1 pH-DAEs and introduce generalized Cayley transforms to uphold energy conservation. The effectiveness of both strategies is evaluated using port-Hamiltonian benchmark examples from electric circuits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variational formulation based on velocity and stress is developed for linear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. The well-posedness and energy stability of this formulation are established. To discretize the problem, a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method is employed. An $hp$-convergence analysis is performed for the resulting semi-discrete scheme. The temporal discretization is achieved via the Crank-Nicolson method, and the convergence properties of the fully discrete scheme are examined. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, confirming the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the interaction of biharmonic waves with a periodic array of cavities, characterized by the Kirchhoff--Love model. This paper investigates the perfectly matched layer (PML) formulation and its numerical soution to the governing biharmonic wave equation. The study establishes the well-posedness of the associated variational problem employing the Fredholm alternative theorem. Based on the examination of an auxiliary problem in the PML layer, exponential convergence of the PML solution is attained. Moreover, it develops and compares three decomposition methods alongside their corresponding mixed finite element formulations, incorporating interior penalty techniques for solving the PML problem. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in absorbing outgoing waves within the PML layers and suppressing oscillations in the bending moment of biharmonic waves near the cavity's surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for a broad range of parameters is a critical challenge in scientific computing. To this end, neural operators, which learn mappings from parameters to solutions, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the numerical method for the bi-Laplace problems with inhomogeneous coefficients; particularly, we propose finite element schemes on rectangular grids respectively for an inhomogeneous fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem and for the Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem. The new methods use the reduced rectangle Morley (RRM for short) element space with piecewise quadratic polynomials, which are of the lowest degree possible. For the finite element space, a discrete analogue of an equality by Grisvard is proved for the stability issue and a locally-averaged interpolation operator is constructed for the approximation issue. Optimal convergence rates of the schemes are proved, and numerical experiments are given to verify the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the PDE and numerical analysis of a modified one-dimensional intravascular stent model originally proposed in [4]. It is proved that the modified model has a unique weak solution using the Galerkin method combined with a compactness argument. A semi-discrete finite element method and a fully discrete scheme using the Euler time-stepping are formulated for the PDE model. Optimal order error estimates in the energy norm are proved for both schemes. Numerical results are presented along with comparisons between different decoupling strategies and time-stepping schemes. Lastly, extensions of the model and its PDE and numerical analysis results to the two-dimensional case are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Mixed Methods with Improved Accuracy: The Role of Oversampling and Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale mixed methods based on non-overlapping domain decompositions can efficiently handle the solution of significant subsurface flow problems in very heterogeneous formations of interest to the industry, especially when implemented on multi-core supercomputers. Efficiency in obtaining numerical solutions is dictated by the choice of interface spaces that are selected: the smaller the dimension of these spaces, the better, in the sense that fewer multiscale basis functions need to be computed, and smaller interface linear systems need to be solved. Thus, in solving large computational problems, it is desirable to work with piecewise constant or linear polynomials for interface spaces. However, for these choices of interface spaces, it is well known that the flux accuracy is of the order of 10-1. This study is dedicated to advancing an efficient and accurate multiscale mixed method aimed at addressing industry-relevant problems. A distinctive feature of our approach involves subdomains with overlapping regions, a departure from conventional methods. We take advantage of the overlapping decomposition to introduce a computationally highly efficient smoothing step designed to rectify small-scale errors inherent in the multiscale solution. The effectiveness of the proposed solver, which maintains a computational cost very close to its predecessors, is demonstrated through a series of numerical studies. Notably, for scenarios involving modestly sized overlapping regions and employing just a few smoothing steps, a substantial enhancement of two orders of magnitude in flux accuracy is achieved with the new approach.</description>

      <title>A bound preserving cut discontinuous Galerkin method for one dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a family of high order cut finite element methods with bound preserving properties for hyperbolic conservation laws in one space dimension. The methods are based on the discontinuous Galerkin framework and use a regular background mesh, where interior boundaries are allowed to cut through the mesh arbitrarily. Our methods include ghost penalty stabilization to handle small cut elements and a new reconstruction of the approximation on macro-elements, which are local patches consisting of cut and un-cut neighboring elements that are connected by stabilization. We show that the reconstructed solution retains conservation and optimal order of accuracy. Our lowest order scheme results in a piecewise constant solution that satisfies a maximum principle for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. When the lowest order scheme is applied to the Euler equations, the scheme is positivity preserving in the sense that positivity of pressure and density are retained. For the high order schemes, suitable bound preserving limiters are applied to the reconstructed solution on macro-elements. In the scalar case, a maximum principle limiter is applied, which ensures that the limited approximation satisfies the maximum principle. Correspondingly, we use a positivity preserving limiter for the Euler equations, and show that our scheme is positivity preserving. In the presence of shocks additional limiting is needed to avoid oscillations, hence we apply a standard TVB limiter to the reconstructed solution. The time step restrictions are of the same order as for the corresponding discontinuous Galerkin methods on the background mesh. Numerical computations illustrate accuracy, bound preservation, and shock capturing capabilities of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>A single-sided all-at-once preconditioning for linear system from a non-local evolutionary equation with weakly singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {In [X. L. Lin, M. K. Ng, and Y. Zhi. {\it J. Comput. Phys.}, 434 (2021), pp. 110221] and [Y. L. Zhao, J. Wu, X. M. Gu, and H. Li. {\it Comput. Math. Appl.}, 148(2023), pp. 200--210]}, two-sided preconditioning techniques are proposed for non-local evolutionary equations, which possesses (i) mesh-size independent theoretical bound of condition number of the two-sided preconditioned matrix; (ii) small and stable iteration numbers in numerical tests. In this paper, we modify the two-sided preconditioning by multiplying the left-sided and the right-sided preconditioners together as a single-sided preconditioner. Such a single-sided preconditioner essentially derives from approximating the spatial matrix with a fast diagonalizable matrix and keeping the temporal matrix unchanged. Clearly, the matrix-vector multiplication of the single-sided preconditioning is faster to compute than that of the two-sided one, since the single-sided preconditioned matrix has a simpler structure. More importantly, we show theoretically that the single-sided preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method has a convergence rate no worse than the two-sided preconditioned one. As a result, the one-sided preconditioned GMRES solver requires less computational time than the two-sided preconditioned GMRES solver in total. Numerical results are reported to show the efficiency of the proposed single-sided preconditioning technique.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis of a spectral problem on curved meshes occurring in diffusion with high order boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work is considered a spectral problem, involving a second order term on the domain boundary: the Laplace-Beltrami operator. A variational formulation is presented, leading to a finite element discretization. For the Laplace-Beltrami operator to make sense on the boundary, the domain is smooth: consequently the computational domain (classically a polygonal domain) will not match the physical one. Thus, the physical domain is discretized using high order curved meshes so as to reduce the \textit{geometric error}. The \textit{lift operator}, which is aimed to transform a function defined on the mesh domain into a function defined on the physical one, is recalled. This \textit{lift} is a key ingredient in estimating errors on eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. A bootstrap method is used to prove the error estimates, which are expressed both in terms of \textit{finite element approximation error} and of \textit{geometric error}, respectively associated to the finite element degree $k\ge 1$ and to the mesh order~$r\ge 1$. Numerical experiments are led on various smooth domains in 2D and 3D, which allow us to validate the presented theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Exploring tau protein and amyloid-beta propagation: a sensitivity analysis of mathematical models based on biological data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia worldwide. Its pathological development is well known to be connected with the accumulation of two toxic proteins: tau protein and amyloid-$\beta$. Mathematical models and numerical simulations can predict the spreading patterns of misfolded proteins in this context. However, the calibration of the model parameters plays a crucial role in the final solution. In this work, we perform a sensitivity analysis of heterodimer and Fisher-Kolmogorov models to evaluate the impact of the equilibrium values of protein concentration on the solution patterns. We adopt advanced numerical methods such as the IMEX-DG method to accurately describe the propagating fronts in the propagation phenomena in a polygonal mesh of sagittal patient-specific brain geometry derived from magnetic resonance images. We calibrate the model parameters using biological measurements in the brain cortex for the tau protein and the amyloid-$\beta$ in Alzheimer's patients and controls. Finally, using the sensitivity analysis results, we discuss the applicability of both models in the correct simulation of the spreading of the two proteins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze divergence-free finite element methods for the Stokes problem on smooth domains. The discrete spaces are based on the Scott-Vogelius finite element pair of arbitrary polynomial degree greater than two. By combining the Piola transform with the classical isoparametric framework, and with a judicious choice of degrees of freedom, we prove that the method converges with optimal order in the energy norm. We also show that the discrete velocity error converges with optimal order in the $L^2$-norm. Numerical experiments are presented, which support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Locally Divergence-Free Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are challenging, as the solutions are required to be magnetic divergence-free for general cases as well as oscillation-free for cases involving discontinuities. To overcome these difficulties, we develop a locally divergence-free oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (LDF-OEDG) method for ideal compressible MHD equations. In the LDF-OEDG method, the numerical solution is advanced in time by using a strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. Following the solution update in each Runge-Kutta stage, an oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure is performed to suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities by damping the modal coefficients of the numerical solution. Subsequently, on each element, the magnetic filed of the oscillation-free DG solution is projected onto a local divergence-free space, to satisfy the divergence-free condition. The OE procedure and the LDF projection are fully decoupled from the Runge-Kutta stage update, and can be non-intrusively integrated into existing DG codes as independent modules. The damping equation of the OE procedure can be solved exactly, making the LDF-OEDG method remain stable under normal CFL conditions. These features enable a straightforward implementation of a high-order LDF-OEDG solver, which can be used to efficiently simulate the ideal compressible MHD equations. Numerical results for benchmark cases demonstrate the high-order accuracy, strong shock capturing capability and robustness of the LDF-OEDG method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an appropriate ordering of the Laurent monomials $x^{i}y^{j}$, $i,j \in {\mathbb Z}$ that allows us to study sequences of orthogonal Laurent polynomials of the real variables $x$ and $y$ with respect to a positive Borel measure $\mu$ defined on ${\mathbb R}^2$ such that $\{ x=0 \}\cup \{ y=0 \} \not\in \textrm{supp}(\mu)$. This ordering is suitable for considering the {\em multiplication plus inverse multiplication operator} on each varibale $\left( x+\frac{1}{x}\right.$ and $\left. y+\frac{1}{y}\right)$, and as a result we obtain five-term recurrence relations, Christoffel-Darboux and confluent formulas for the reproducing kernel and a related Favard's theorem. A connection with the one variable case is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of large-scale numerical simulation of radiation transport is the high memory and computation time requirements of discretization methods for kinetic equations. In this work, we derive and investigate a neural network-based approximation to the entropy closure method to accurately compute the solution of the multi-dimensional moment system with a low memory footprint and competitive computational time. We extend methods developed for the standard entropy-based closure to the context of regularized entropy-based closures. The main idea is to interpret structure-preserving neural network approximations of the regularized entropy closure as a two-stage approximation to the original entropy closure. We conduct a numerical analysis of this approximation and investigate optimal parameter choices. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the method has a much lower memory footprint than traditional methods with competitive computation times and simulation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper explores the convergence behavior of two waveform relaxation algorithms, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation algorithms, for an optimal control problem with a sub-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) constraint. The algorithms are tested on regular 1D domains with multiple subdomains, and the analysis focuses on how different constant values of the generalized diffusion coefficient affect the convergence of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-Based Projections for Uncertainty Quantification near Stochastically Perturbed Limit Cycles and Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near transversally stable periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that does not support closed-form analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation via Schrodingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a quantum simulation technique for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. Traditional semi-discretization methods often fail to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and may even modify the Hamiltonian structure, particularly when incorporating boundary conditions. We address this challenge by employing the Schrodingerization method-it converts any linear partial and ordinary differential equation with non-Hermitian dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations. We explore the application in two distinct forms of the Fokker-Planck equation. For the conservation form, we show that the semi-discretization-based Schrodingerization is preferable, especially when dealing with non-periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, we analyze the Schrodingerization approach for unstable systems that possess positive eigenvalues in the real part of the coefficient matrix or differential operator. Our analysis reveals that the direct use of Schrodingerization has the same effect as a stabilization procedure. For the heat equation form, we propose a quantum simulation procedure based on the time-splitting technique. We discuss the relationship between operator splitting in the Schrodingerization method and its application directly to the original problem, illustrating how the Schrodingerization method accurately reproduces the time-splitting solutions at each step. Furthermore, we explore finite difference discretizations of the heat equation form using shift operators. Utilizing Fourier bases, we diagonalize the shift operators, enabling efficient simulation in the frequency space. Providing additional guidance on implementing the diagonal unitary operators, we conduct a comparative analysis between diagonalizations in the Bell and the Fourier bases, and show that the former generally exhibits greater efficiency than the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In areas such as finance, engineering, and science, we often face situations that change quickly and unpredictably. These situations are tough to handle and require special tools and methods capable of understanding and predicting what might happen next. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are renowned for modeling and analyzing real-world dynamical systems. However, obtaining the parameters, boundary conditions, and closed-form solutions of SDEs can often be challenging. In this paper, we will discuss the application of Kalman filtering theory to SDEs, including Extended Kalman filtering and Particle Extended Kalman filtering. We will explore how to fit existing SDE systems through filtering and track the original SDEs by fitting the obtained closed-form solutions. This approach aims to gather more information about these SDEs, which could be used in various ways, such as incorporating them into parameters of data-based SDE models.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Time Low-Rank Approximation of Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sublinear time algorithm for computing a near optimal low-rank approximation to any positive semidefinite (PSD) Toeplitz matrix $T\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, given noisy access to its entries. In particular, given entrywise query access to $T+E$ for an arbitrary noise matrix $E\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, integer rank $k\leq d$, and error parameter $\delta&gt;0$, our algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(k,\log(d/\delta))$ and outputs (in factored form) a Toeplitz matrix $\widetilde{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ with rank $\text{poly}(k,\log(d/\delta))$ satisfying, for some fixed constant $C$, \begin{equation*}
  \|T-\widetilde{T}\|_F \leq C \cdot \max\{\|E\|_F,\|T-T_k\|_F\} + \delta \cdot \|T\|_F. \end{equation*} Here $\|\cdot \|_F$ is the Frobenius norm and $T_k$ is the best (not necessarily Toeplitz) rank-$k$ approximation to $T$ in the Frobenius norm, given by projecting $T$ onto its top $k$ eigenvectors.
  Our result has the following applications. When $E = 0$, we obtain the first sublinear time near-relative-error low-rank approximation algorithm for PSD Toeplitz matrices, resolving the main open problem of Kapralov et al. SODA `23, whose algorithm had sublinear query complexity but exponential runtime. Our algorithm can also be applied to approximate the unknown Toeplitz covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, given sample access to this distribution, resolving an open question of Eldar et al. SODA `20.
  Our algorithm applies sparse Fourier transform techniques to recover a low-rank Toeplitz matrix using its Fourier structure. Our key technical contribution is the first polynomial time algorithm for \emph{discrete time off-grid} sparse Fourier recovery, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: The Zernike radial polynomials are a system of orthogonal polynomials over the unit interval with weight x. They are used as basis functions in optics to expand fields over the cross section of circular pupils. To calculate the roots of Zernike polynomials, we optimize the generic iterative numerical Newton's Method that iterates on zeros of functions with third order convergence. The technique is based on rewriting the polynomials as Gauss Hypergeometric Functions, reduction of second order derivatives to first order derivatives, and evaluation of some ratios of derivatives by terminating continued fractions.
  A PARI program and a short table of zeros complete up to polynomials of 40th order are included.</description>

      <title>On convergence of waveform relaxation for nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To integrate large systems of nonlinear differential equations in time, we consider a variant of nonlinear waveform relaxation (also known as dynamic iteration or Picard-Lindel\"of iteration), where at each iteration a linear inhomogeneous system of differential equations has to be solved. This is done by the exponential block Krylov subspace (EBK) method. Thus, we have an inner-outer iterative method, where iterative approximations are determined over a certain time interval, with no time stepping involved. This approach has recently been shown to be efficient as a time-parallel integrator within the PARAEXP framework. In this paper, convergence behavior of this method is assessed theoretically and practically. We examine efficiency of the method by testing it on nonlinear Burgers, three-dimensional Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand, and three-dimensional nonlinear heat conduction equations and comparing its performance with that of conventional time-stepping integrators.</description>

      <title>A DEIM-CUR factorization with iterative SVDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A CUR factorization is often utilized as a substitute for the singular value decomposition (SVD), especially when a concrete interpretation of the singular vectors is challenging. Moreover, if the original data matrix possesses properties like nonnegativity and sparsity, a CUR decomposition can better preserve them compared to the SVD. An essential aspect of this approach is the methodology used for selecting a subset of columns and rows from the original matrix. This study investigates the effectiveness of \emph{one-round sampling} and iterative subselection techniques and introduces new iterative subselection strategies based on iterative SVDs. One provably appropriate technique for index selection in constructing a CUR factorization is the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Our contribution aims to improve the approximation quality of the DEIM scheme by iteratively invoking it in several rounds, in the sense that we select subsequent columns and rows based on the previously selected ones. Thus, we modify $A$ after each iteration by removing the information that has been captured by the previously selected columns and rows. We also discuss how iterative procedures for computing a few singular vectors of large data matrices can be integrated with the new iterative subselection strategies. We present the results of numerical experiments, providing a comparison of one-round sampling and iterative subselection techniques, and demonstrating the improved approximation quality associated with using the latter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper a set of previous general results for the development of B--series for a broad class of stochastic differential equations has been collected. The applicability of these results is demonstrated by the derivation of B--series for non-autonomous semi-linear SDEs and exponential Runge-Kutta methods applied to this class of SDEs, which is a significant generalization of existing theory on such methods.</description>

      <title>A unified treatment of tractability for approximation problems defined on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large literature specifies conditions under which the information complexity for a sequence of numerical problems defined for dimensions $1, 2, \ldots$ grows at a moderate rate, i.e., the sequence of problems is tractable. Here, we focus on the situation where the space of available information consists of all linear functionals and the problems are defined as linear operator mappings between Hilbert spaces. We unify the proofs of known tractability results and generalize a number of existing results. These generalizations are expressed as five theorems that provide equivalent conditions for (strong) tractability in terms of sums of functions of the singular values of the solution operators.</description>

      <title>Multiscale interpolative construction of quantized tensor trains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantized tensor trains (QTTs) have recently emerged as a framework for the numerical discretization of continuous functions, with the potential for widespread applications in numerical analysis. However, the theory of QTT approximation is not fully understood. In this work, we advance this theory from the point of view of multiscale polynomial interpolation. This perspective clarifies why QTT ranks decay with increasing depth, quantitatively controls QTT rank in terms of smoothness of the target function, and explains why certain functions with sharp features and poor quantitative smoothness can still be well approximated by QTTs. The perspective also motivates new practical and efficient algorithms for the construction of QTTs from function evaluations on multiresolution grids.</description>

      <title>Proving the stability estimates of variational least-squares Kernel-Based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for the rigorous analysis of the numerical stability of variational least-squares kernel-based methods for solving second-order elliptic partial differential equations, we provide previously lacking stability inequalities. This fills a significant theoretical gap in the previous work [Comput. Math. Appl. 103 (2021) 1-11], which provided error estimates based on a conjecture on the stability. With the stability estimate now rigorously proven, we complete the theoretical foundations and compare the convergence behavior to the proven rates. Furthermore, we establish another stability inequality involving weighted-discrete norms, and provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that the exact quadrature weights are not necessary for the weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method to converge. Our novel theoretical insights are validated by numerical examples, which showcase the relative efficiency and accuracy of these methods on data sets with large mesh ratios. The results confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the performance of variational least-squares kernel-based method, least-squares kernel-based collocation method, and our new weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that all methods converge at the same rate, validating the convergence theory of weighted least-squares in our proven theories.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Method for Computing Multiple Solutions of Differential Equations with polynomial nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach, the Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Method, tailored for computing multiple solutions to differential equations characterized by polynomial nonlinearities. Departing from conventional practices of predefining candidate basis pools, our novel method adaptively computes bases, considering the equation's nature and structural characteristics of the solution. It further leverages companion matrix techniques to generate initial guesses for subsequent computations. Thus this approach not only yields numerous initial guesses for solving such equations but also adapts orthogonal basis functions to effectively address discretized nonlinear systems. Through a series of numerical experiments, this paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness and robustness. By reducing computational costs in various applications, this novel approach opens new avenues for uncovering multiple solutions to differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>An iterative method for the solution of Laplace-like equations in high and very high space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the equation $-\Delta u+\mu u=f$ on high-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^m$, where the right-hand side $f(x)=F(Tx)$ is composed of a separable function $F$ with an integrable Fourier transform on a space of a dimension $n&gt;m$ and a linear mapping given by a matrix $T$ of full rank and $\mu\geq 0$ is a constant. For example, the right-hand side can explicitly depend on differences $x_i-x_j$ of components of $x$. Following our publication [Numer. Math. (2020) 146:219--238], we show that the solution of this equation can be expanded into sums of functions of the same structure and develop in this framework an equally simple and fast iterative method for its computation. The method is based on the observation that in almost all cases and for large problem classes the expression $\|T^ty\|^2$ deviates on the unit sphere $\|y\|=1$ the less from its mean value the higher the dimension $m$ is, a concentration of measure effect. The higher the dimension $m$, the faster the iteration converges.</description>

      <title>Low-rank alternating direction doubling algorithm for solving large-scale continuous time algebraic Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an effective low-rank alternating direction doubling algorithm (R-ADDA) for computing numerical low-rank solutions to large-scale sparse continuous-time algebraic Riccati matrix equations. The method is based on the alternating direction doubling algorithm (ADDA), utilizing the low-rank property of matrices and employing Cholesky factorization for solving. The advantage of the new algorithm lies in computing only the $2^k$-th approximation during the iterative process, instead of every approximation. Its efficient low-rank formula saves storage space and is highly effective from a computational perspective. Finally, the effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Process flowsheet optimization with surrogate and implicit formulations of a Gibbs reactor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative formulations for the optimization of chemical process flowsheets are presented that leverage surrogate models and implicit functions to replace and remove, respectively, the algebraic equations that describe a difficult-to-converge Gibbs reactor unit operation. Convergence reliability, solve time, and solution quality of an optimization problem are compared among full-space, ALAMO surrogate, neural network surrogate, and implicit function formulations. Both surrogate and implicit formulations lead to better convergence reliability, with low sensitivity to process parameters. The surrogate formulations are faster at the cost of minor solution error, while the implicit formulation provides exact solutions with similar solve time. In a parameter sweep on an autothermal reformer flowsheet optimization problem, the full space formulation solves 33 out of 64 instances, while the implicit function formulation solves 52 out of 64 instances, the ALAMO polynomial formulation solves 64 out of 64 instances, and the neural network formulation solves 48 out of 64 instances. This work demonstrates the trade-off between accuracy and solve time that exists in current methods for improving convergence reliability of chemical process flowsheet optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Discussion of the Effect of Inter-group Sub-groups Using a Consensus Model Incorporating External Effective or Immobile Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals belong to certain social groups in search of a sense of belonging, pride, stability, and significance. Perceiving the group to which one belongs as an "in-group" and other groups as "out-groups" often leads to harmful and discriminatory attitudes. In-group consciousness reinforces a sense of unity within the group and promotes commitment to group goals and problem solving. Identification with the in-group also shapes the social cognitive framework (norms, values, and beliefs) that determine group behavior. In fact, identification with an in-group often leads to prejudice, ethnocentrism, stereotyping, and discrimination, even in the absence of physical conflict or hostility. Social scientists have conducted thousands of empirical studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind these prejudices and discriminations and the social conflicts they generate. These studies are essential to understanding the processes by which group membership and self-categorization create prejudice and discrimination, which in turn lead to social conflict. However, there remain many unanswered questions about howin-groups and out-groups canmove beyond conflict to build harmony and avoid social conflict. According to existing research, it is difficult to establish harmonious relationships between in-groups and out-groups. This study proposes an approach using opinion dynamics theory and social simulation to examine these issues. We examine the possibility of simulating the movement of opinions between and within groups and applying the considerations to cases of social conflict. The model analyzes the severity of conflict within a society with two groups on the basis of intragroup and intergroup trust.</description>

      <title>Tractable Optimal Experimental Design using Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a flexible method for computing Bayesian optimal experimental designs (BOEDs) for inverse problems with intractable posteriors. The approach is applicable to a wide range of BOED problems and can accommodate various optimality criteria, prior distributions and noise models. The key to our approach is the construction of a transport-map-based surrogate to the joint probability law of the design, observational and inference random variables. This order-preserving transport map is constructed using tensor trains and can be used to efficiently sample from (and evaluate approximate densities of) conditional distributions that are required in the evaluation of many commonly-used optimality criteria. The algorithm is also extended to sequential data acquisition problems, where experiments can be performed in sequence to update the state of knowledge about the unknown parameters. The sequential BOED problem is made computationally feasible by preconditioning the approximation of the joint density at the current stage using transport maps constructed at previous stages. The flexibility of our approach in finding optimal designs is illustrated with some numerical examples inspired by disease modeling and the reconstruction of subsurface structures in aquifers.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>
