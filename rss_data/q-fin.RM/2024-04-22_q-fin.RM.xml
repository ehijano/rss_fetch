      <title>Extremal cases of distortion risk measures with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the best- and worst-case of a general class of distortion risk measures when only partial information regarding the underlying distributions is available. Specifically, explicit sharp lower and upper bounds for a general class of distortion risk measures are derived based on the first two moments along with some shape information, such as symmetry/unimodality property of the underlying distributions. The proposed approach provides a unified framework for extremal problems of distortion risk measures.</description>

      <title>Dispensing with optimal control: a new approach for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts, overcoming the limitations of traditional optimal control methods, which frequently encounter difficulties with high-dimensional state spaces and the intricacies of selecting appropriate risk penalty or risk aversion parameter. Our methodology applies optimized heuristic strategies to maximize the contract's value. The computation of this value utilizes classical methods typically used for pricing path-dependent Bermudan options. Additionally, our approach naturally leads to the formulation of a hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>Elicitability and identifiability of tail risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tail risk measures are fully determined by the distribution of the underlying loss beyond its quantile at a certain level, with Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall being prime examples. They are induced by law-based risk measures, called their generators, evaluated on the tail distribution. This paper establishes joint identifiability and elicitability results of tail risk measures together with the corresponding quantile, provided that their generators are identifiable and elicitable, respectively. As an example, we establish the joint identifiability and elicitability of the tail expectile together with the quantile. The corresponding consistent scores constitute a novel class of weighted scores, nesting the known class of scores of Fissler and Ziegel for the Expected Shortfall together with the quantile. For statistical purposes, our results pave the way to easier model fitting for tail risk measures via regression and the generalized method of moments, but also model comparison and model validation in terms of established backtesting procedures.</description>

      <title>Statistical Validation of Contagion Centrality in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel centrality measure to evaluate shock propagation on financial networks capturing a notion of contagion and systemic risk contributions. In comparison to many popular centrality metrics (e.g., eigenvector centrality) which provide only a relative centrality between nodes, our proposed measure is in an absolute scale permitting comparisons of contagion risk over time. In addition, we provide a statistical validation method when the network is estimated from data, as is done in practice. This statistical test allows us to reliably assess the computed centrality values. We validate our methodology on simulated data and conduct empirical case studies using financial data. We find that our proposed centrality measure increases significantly during times of financial distress and is able to provide insights in to the (market implied) risk-levels of different firms and sectors.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibria in Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to the global climate crisis, governments worldwide are introducing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help mitigate environmental catastrophes. One method to encourage emission reductions is to incentivize carbon capturing and carbon reducing projects while simultaneously penalising excess GHG output. Firms that invest in such projects or reduce their emissions can receive offset credits (OCs) in return. They may then use OCs for regulatory purposes to offset emissions in a compliance period or trade them. Here, we present a novel market framework and characterise the optimal behaviour of GHG OC market participants in both single-player and two-player settings. The single player setting is posed as an optimal stopping and control problem, while the two-player setting is posed as optimal stopping and mixed-Nash equilibria problem. We demonstrate the importance of acting optimally using numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations and explore the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous players.</description>
