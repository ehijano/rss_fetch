      <title>Curvature positivity for K\"ahler and quasi-K\"ahler flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the notions of Griffiths and dual-Nakano positivity for the curvature of the Chern connection on K\"ahler and quasi-K\"ahler flag manifolds, as well as for the complex projective space. In this setting, we prove that every flag manifold endowed with a complex structure admits a metric of dual-Nakano semi-positive curvature, and we give a full classification of K\"ahler flag manifolds with Griffiths semi-positive curvature. Next we prove a series of restrictions for a quasi-K\"ahler flag manifold to have Griffiths semi-positive curvature, and we conjecture that in fact, there are no such metrics for non-integrable almost-complex structures. Lastly, we give a full classification on invariant metrics on the complex projective space with Griffiths and dual-Nakano semi-positive curvature.</description>

      <title>New weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities and Minkowski inequalities in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a broad class of new sharp Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities involving general convex weight functions for static convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. Additionally, we derive new weighted Minkowski-type inequalities for static convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ and for convex hypersurfaces in the sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$. The tools we shall use are the locally constrained inverse curvature flows in hyperbolic space and in the sphere.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet Problem at Infinity and Poisson Boundary for Certain Manifolds without Conjugate Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of the bounded harmonic functions on a simply connected Riemannian manifold $\widetilde{M}$ without conjugate points, which can be compactified via the ideal boundary $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be a uniform visibility manifold which satisfy the Axiom $2$, or a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a cocompact discrete subgroup of $Iso(\widetilde{M})$, we show that for a given continuous function on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, there exists a harmonic extension to $\widetilde{M}$. And furthermore, when $\widetilde{M}$ is a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, the Brownian motion defines a family of harmonic measures $\nu_{\ast}$ on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, we show that $(\widetilde{M}(\infty),\nu_{\ast})$ is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two $p$-eigenvalue pinching sphere theorems, for the \( p \)-Laplacian, $p&gt;1$. One of the results states that if the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold with sectional curvature $K_{M}\geq 1$ is sufficiently close to the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of $\mathbb{S}^{n}$ then $M$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. Our results extend sphere theorems originally settled for the Laplacian by Croke and Bessa.</description>

      <title>Weak metric structures on generalized Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear connections with torsion are important in the study of generalized Riemannian manifolds $(M,G=g+F)$, where the symmetric part $g$ of $G$ is a non-degenerate (0,2)-tensor and $F$ is the skew-symmetric part. Some space-time models in theoretical physics are based on $(M,G=g+F)$, where $F$ is defined using a complex structure. In the paper, we first study more general models, where $F$ has constant rank and is based on weak metric structures (introduced by the first author and R. Wolak), which generalize almost contact and $f$-contact structures. We~consider metric connections (i.e., preserving $G$) with totally skew-symmetric torsion tensor. For rank$(F)=\dim M$ and non-conformal tensor $A^2$, where $A$ is a skew-symmetric (1,1)-tensor adjoint to~$F$, we apply weak almost Hermitian structures to fundamental results (by the second author and S. Ivanov) on generalized Riemannian manifolds and prove that the manifold is a weighted product of several nearly K\"ahler manifolds corresponding to eigen-distributions of $A^2$. For~rank$(F)&lt;\dim M$ we apply weak $f$-structures and obtain splitting results for generalized Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Some invariant connections on symplectic reductive homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symplectic reductive homogeneous space is a pair $(G/H,\Omega)$, where $G/H$ is a reductive homogeneous $G$-space and $\Omega$ is a $G$-invariant symplectic form on it. The main examples include symplectic Lie groups, symplectic symmetric spaces, and flag manifolds. This paper focuses on the existence of a natural symplectic connection on $(G/H,\Omega)$. First, we introduce a family $\{\nabla^{a,b}\}_{(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2}$ of $G$-invariant connection on $G/H$, and establish that $\nabla^{0,1}$ is flat if and only if $(G/H,\Omega)$ is locally a symplectic Lie group. Next, we show that among all $\{\nabla^{a,b}\}_{(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2}$, there exists a unique symplectic connection, denoted by $\nabla^\mathbf{s}$, corresponding to $a=b=\tfrac{1}{3}$, a fact that seems to have previously gone unnoticed. We then compute its curvature and Ricci curvature tensors. Finally, we demonstrate that the $\operatorname{SU}(3)$-invariant preferred symplectic connection of the Wallach flag manifold $\operatorname{SU}(3)/\mathbb{T}^2$ (from Cahen-Gutt-Rawnsley) coincides with the natural symplectic connection $\nabla^\mathbf{s}$, which is furthermore Ricci-parallel.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system on smooth domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new assumption (1.2) that involves a small oscillation and $C^2$ norms for maps from smooth bounded domains into Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, by assuming that the domain has non-negative Ricci curvature, we establish the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system via the mean curvature flow (MCF) with boundary. The long-time existence of such flow is derived using Bernstein-type theorems of higher codimensional self-shrinkers in the whole space and the half-space. Another novel aspect is that our hypothesis imposes no restriction on the diameter of the domains, which implies an existence result for an exterior Dirichlet problem of the minimal surface system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of Dragovic et al arXiv2504.20515 stating that the magnetic geodesic flow on the standard sphere $S^n\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ whose magnetic 2-form is the restriction of a constant 2-form from $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is Liouville integrable. The integrals are quadratic and linear in momenta.</description>

      <title>The Willmore Energy Landscape of Spheres and Avoidable Singularities of the Willmore Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sublevel sets of the Willmore energy on the space of smoothly immersed $ 2 $-spheres in Euclidean $ 3 $-space. We show that the subset of immersions with energy at most $ 12\pi $ consists of four regular homotopy classes. Moreover, we show that in certain regular homotopy classes, all singularities of the Willmore flow are avoidable, that is, the initial surface admits a regular homotopy to a round sphere whose Willmore energy does not exceed that of the initial surface. This yields a classification of initial surfaces with energy at most $ 12\pi $ that lead to unavoidable singularities. As a further consequence, we obtain an extension of the Li-Yau inequality at $ 12\pi $ for a large class of immersed spheres without triple points. To prove these results, we glue together different instances of the Willmore flow and employ an invariant for triple-point-free immersed spheres.</description>

      <title>Classification of Toda-type tt*-structures and $\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$-fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23886v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>

      <title>A scalar-mean curvature comparison theorem for manifolds with iterated conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Dirac operator method to prove a scalar-mean curvature comparison theorem for spin manifolds which carry iterated conical singularities. Our approach is to study the index theory of a twisted Dirac operator on such singular manifolds. A dichotomy argument is used to prove the comparison theorem without knowing precisely the index of the twisted Dirac operator. This framework also enables us to prove a rigidity theorem of Euclidean domains and a spin positive mass theorem for asymptotically flat manifolds with iterated conical singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a Schauder-type boundary regularity result for a two-dimensional singular Monge-Amp\'ere equation on convex polytopes with Guillemin boundary conditions. This extends the previous work of Rubin and Huang to the case where the right-hand side is less regular; specifically, H\"older continuous functions. Our method relies heavily on the sophisticated techniques developed by Donaldson in his series of papers on the Abreu equation.</description>

      <title>On sporadic symmetry breaking operators for principal series representations of the de Sitter and Lorentz groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and classify all differential symmetry breaking operators $\mathbb{D}_{\lambda, \nu}^{N,m}: C^\infty(S^3, \mathcal{V}_\lambda^{2N+1})\rightarrow C^\infty(S^2, \mathcal{L}_{m, \nu})$ between principal series representations with respect to the restriction $SO_0(4,1) \downarrow SO_0(3,1)$ when the parameters satisfy the condition $|m| &gt; N$. In this case we also prove a localness theorem, namely, all symmetry breaking operators between the principal series representations above are necessarily differential operators. In addition, we show that all these symmetry breaking operators are sporadic in the sense of T. Kobayashi, that is, they cannot be obtained by residue formulas of distributional kernels.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler manifolds with nef anti-canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ with the nef anti-canonical bundle $-K_{X}$ admits a locally trivial fibration $\phi \colon X \to Y$, where the fiber $F$ is a rationally connected manifold and the base $Y$ is a Calabi--Yau manifold. We introduce a suitable approach that extends the strategy of Cao--H\"oring, originally developed for smooth projective varieties, to more general singular K\"ahler spaces. A key technical ingredient is a flatness criterion for pseudo-effective sheaves with vanishing first Chern class.</description>

      <title>Truncated symbols of differential symmetry breaking operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations, which generalizes the symbol $\mathrm{symb}(\mathbb{D})$ for abelian nilpotent radicals to the non-abelian case. The inverse $\mathrm{symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{symb}_0$ enables one to perform a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical.
  As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</description>

      <title>The matrix weighted real-analytic double fibration transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the real-analytic matrix-weighted double fibration transform determines the analytic wavefront set of a vector-valued function. We apply this result to show that the matrix weighted ray transform is injective on a two-dimensional, non-trapping, real-analytic Riemannian manifold with strictly convex boundary. Additionally, we show that a real-analytic Higgs field can be uniquely determined from the nonabelian ray transform on real-analytic Riemannian manifolds of any dimension with a strictly convex boundary point.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of Horospheres and Weingarten Surfaces in Hyperbolic 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive basic differential geometric formulae for surfaces in hyperbolic space represented as envelopes of horospheres. The dual notion of parallel hypersurfaces is also studied. The representation is applied to prove existence and regularity theorems for Weingarten surfaces in H^3, which satisfy (1-a)K = a(2-H), for an a &lt; 0, and have a specified boundary curve at infinity. These surfaces are shown to be closely connected to conformal mappings of domains in S^2 into the unit disk and provide Riemannian interpretations for some conformal invariants associated to such mappings.
  This paper was originally written in 1984, before I learned to use TeX, and was typed by one of the secretaries in the Princeton Math Department. It was more or less, my first original work after my dissertation. For some reason, I was not able to get this paper published in a timely manner. The results and perspective in this paper have proved to be useful to a variety of people, some of whom asked me to render the article into TeX and post it to the arXiv. I had been seriously thinking about doing this, when Martin Bridgeman sent me a transcription of my original article into TeX. I am extremely grateful to him for the effort he has put into this project.
  The paper is now formatted in a more or less modern AMS-article style, but for lots of additional punctuation, a few corrections and some minor stylistic changes, the content has been largely reproduced as it originally was. Remarks about the 'state-of-the-art' in hyperbolic geometry are obviously way out of date, as there has been enormous progress in many aspects of this still rich subject.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate certain geometric inequalities on quasi-Einstein manifolds. We use the generalized Reilly's formulas by Qiu-Xia and Li-Xia to establish new boundary estimates and an isoperimetric type inequality for compact quasi-Einstein manifolds with boundary. Boundary estimates in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator and the Hawking mass are also established. In particular, we present a Heintze-Karcher type inequality for compact domains in quasi-Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hitchin component of the character variety of representations of a surface group $\pi_1(S)$ into $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \geq 3$ can be equipped with a pressure metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus equals the Weil--Petersson metric up to a constant factor. We show that if the genus of $S$ is at least $3$, then the Fuchsian locus contains quasi-convex subsets of infinite diameter for the Weil--Petersson metric whose diameter for the path metric of the pressure metric is finite. This is established through showing that biinfinite paths of bending deformations have controlled bounded length.</description>

      <title>Manifold Diffusion Geometry: Curvature, Tangent Spaces, and Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel estimators for computing the curvature, tangent spaces, and dimension of data from manifolds, using tools from diffusion geometry. Although classical Riemannian geometry is a rich source of inspiration for geometric data analysis and machine learning, it has historically been hard to implement these methods in a way that performs well statistically. Diffusion geometry lets us develop Riemannian geometry methods that are accurate and, crucially, also extremely robust to noise and low-density data. The methods we introduce here are comparable to the existing state-of-the-art on ideal dense, noise-free data, but significantly outperform them in the presence of noise or sparsity. In particular, our dimension estimate improves on the existing methods on a challenging benchmark test when even a small amount of noise is added. Our tangent space and scalar curvature estimates do not require parameter selection and substantially improve on existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolution of space curves governed by the Pohlmeyer-Lund-Regge (PLR) equation, an integrable extension of the sine-Gordon equation. We examine a specific type of curve evolution, known as the Lund-Regge evolution, and derive its representation in the Frenet frame. We show the Frenet frame evolution aligns with the Lax system of the PLR equation and develop a construction method for curve families via the Sym formula. In conclusion, we describe the Lund-Regge evolution corresponding the Date multi-soliton solutions to the PLR equation, with illustrations of curves and surfaces.</description>

Abstract: The Euler-Poincare characteristic, or Euler characteristic in short, is a fundamental topological invariant of compact manifolds that plays a crucial role in a variety of geometric and topological situations. From this point of view, we tried to expand on this important concept in supergeometry. In this article, we introduce the Euler-Poincare characteristic pair in the supergeometry. In the final section, we examine transversality in the category of $\Pi$-symmetric supermanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of prescribing Chern scalar curvatures on complete Hermitian manifolds. Firstly, we re-prove our recent result for prescribing sign-changing Chern scalar curvatures on compact Hermitian manifolds by using the classical maximum principle. Secondly, we study this problem on complete noncompact Hermitian manifolds, and generalize the Aviles-McOwen's existence results [J. Differential Geom., 21 (1985): 269-281] from Poincar\'e disks to higher dimensional Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intersection of positive closed currents on domains using the theory of tangent currents in connection with King's residue formula. One of the main results provides a reasonable sufficient condition for the definition of the (proper) intersection of positive closed currents on domains. Another is an analytic description of the self-intersection of analytic subsets. The key idea is to connect tangent currents to complex Monge-Amp\`ere type currents. We also investigate the existence, the $h$-dimension and the shadow of tangent currents. Additionally, we introduce local regularizations of positive closed currents, examine classical examples and look into the relationship between our approach and slicing theory. Our work extends to general complex manifolds including compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of Fano fibration with asymptotically conical base from degenerating Fano fibration.</description>
