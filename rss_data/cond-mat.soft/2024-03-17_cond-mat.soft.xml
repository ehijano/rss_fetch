      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several enzymes show enhanced diffusion in the presence of substrate a feature that is explained by postulating that the enzyme in the bound state has a higher diffusion constant than in the unbound state. In a recent experiment [Jee et al. PNAS, 115, E10812 (2018)], it was observed that some of these enzymes perform a run-and-tumble motion, where the self-propulsion velocities can be of the order of mm/s. Theoretical models of nanoscale swimmers have not been able to explain the high self-propulsion speeds measured in experiments. Here we model the enzyme as a dimer with fluctuating mobility. We show that even a dimer can perform a run-and-tumble motion when the dimer switches between states of different mobility in the enzymatic cycle. Within a three-state enzymatic cycle, we investigate the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds consistent with experiments can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Polymer Concentration Regimes from Fractional Microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a framework for deriving theoretical equations for mean squared displacement (MSD) and fractional Fokker-Planck (FFP) is developed for any arbitrary rheological model. The obtained general results are then specified for two fractional rheological models. To test our framework and bridge the gap between microrheology and fractional rheological models, the microrheology of polystyrene (PS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions at several polymer concentrations is measured. By comparing the experimental and theoretical MSDs, we find the fractional rheological parameters and demonstrate that the polymer concentration regimes can be distinguished using the fractional exponent and relaxation time data because of the existence of a distinct behavior in each regime. We suggest simple approximations for the critical overlap concentration and the shear viscosity of weakly subdiffusive solutions with small relaxation times. This work provides an alternative and more sensitive approach for distinguishing different polymer concentration regimes and measuring the critical overlap concentration and shear viscosity of polymeric solutions, which is useful when conventional rheological characterization methods are unreliable due to the volatility and low viscosity of the samples.</description>

      <title>Self-Aligning Polar Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-alignment describes the property of a polar active unit to align or anti-align its orientation towards its velocity. In contrast to mutual alignment, where the headings of multiple active units tend to directly align to each other -- as in the celebrated Vicsek model --, self-alignment impacts the dynamics at the individual level by coupling the rotation and displacements of each active unit. This enriches the dynamics even without interactions or external forces, and allows, for example, a single self-propelled particle to orbit in a harmonic potential. At the collective level, self-alignment modifies the nature of the transition to collective motion already in the mean field description, and it can also lead to other forms of self-organization such as collective actuation in dense or solid elastic assemblies of active units. This has significant implications for the study of dense biological systems, metamaterials, and swarm robotics. Here, we review a number of models that were introduced independently to describe the previously overlooked property of self-alignment and identify some of its experimental realizations. Our aim is three-fold: (i)~underline the importance of self-alignment in active systems, especially in the context of dense populations of active units and active solids; (ii)~provide a unified mathematical and conceptual framework for the description of self-aligning systems; (iii)~discuss the common features and specific differences of the existing models of self-alignment. We conclude by discussing promising research avenues in which the concept of self-alignment could play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Two-step aging dynamics in enzymatic milk gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels undergo a phenomenon known as physical aging, i.e., a continuous change of their physical properties with time after the gel point. To date, most of the research effort on aging in gels has been focused on suspensions of hard colloidal particles. In this letter, we tackle the case of soft colloidal "micelles" comprised of proteins, where gelation is induced by the addition of an enzyme. Using time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy, we monitor the viscoelastic properties of a suspension of colloidal micelles through the sol-gel transition and its subsequent aging. We show that the microscopic scenario underpinning the macroscopic aging dynamics comprises two sequential steps. First, the gel microstructure undergoes rapid coarsening, as observed by optical microscopy, followed by arrest. Second, aging occurs solely through a contact-driven mechanism, as evidenced by the square-root dependence of the yield stress with the elastic modulus measured at different ages of the gel. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of aging in enzymatic milk gels, which is crucial not only for a broad range of dairy products, but also for soft colloids in general.</description>

      <title>Active nematic-isotropic interfaces on flat surfaces: effects of anchoring, ordering field and activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surface in contact with the isotropic phase of a passive liquid crystal can induce nematic order over distances that range from microscopic to macroscopic when the nematic-isotropic interface undergoes an orientational-wetting transition. If the nematic is active, what happens to the interface? Does it propagate and, if it does, is its structure different from the passive one? In this paper, we address these questions. We investigate how the active nematic-isotropic interface is affected by the anchoring strength of the surface, the bulk ordering field and the activity. We find that while passive interfaces are one-dimensional the active ones exhibit two dynamical regimes: a passive-like regime and a propagating regime where the interfaces propagate until the entire domain is active nematic. Active interfaces break the translational symmetry within the interfacial plane above a threshold activity, where the active nematic fluctuations, which are ultimately responsible for the emergence of an active turbulent nematic phase, drive non-steady dynamical interfacial regimes.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Engulfment of Active Colloids by Giant Lipid Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to design artificial micro/nanomachines able to perform sophisticated tasks crucially depends on the understanding of their interaction with biosystems and their compatibility with the biological environment. Here, Janus colloids fuelled only by glucose and light were designed, which can autonomously interact with cell-like compartments and trigger endocytosis. The crucial role played by the far field hydrodynamic interaction arising from the puller/pusher swimming mode and adhesion is evidenced. It is shown that a large contact time between the active particle and the lipid membrane is required to observe the engulfment of a particle inside a floppy giant lipid vesicle. Active Janus colloids showing relatively small velocities and a puller type swimming mode are able to target giant vesicles, deform their membranes and subsequently get stably engulfed. An instability arising from the unbound membrane segment is responsible for the transition between partial and complete stable engulfment. These experiments shed light on the physical criteria required for autonomous active particle engulfment in giant vesicles, which can serve as general principles in disciplines ranging from drug delivery and microbial infection to nanomedecine.</description>

      <title>Attractive carbon black dispersions: structural and mechanical responses to shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological behavior of colloidal dispersions is of paramount importance in a wide range of applications, including construction materials, energy storage systems and food industry products. These dispersions consistently exhibit non-Newtonian behaviors, a consequence of intricate interplays involving colloids morphology, volume fraction, and inter-particle forces. Understanding how colloids structure under flow remains a challenge, particularly in the presence of attractive forces leading to clusters formation. In this study, we adopt a synergistic approach, combining rheology with ultra small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), to probe the flow-induced structural transformations of attractive carbon black (CB) dispersions and their effects on the viscosity. Our key findings can be summarized as follow. First, testing different CB volume fractions, in the high shear rate hydrodynamic regime, CB particles aggregate to form fractal clusters. Their size conforms to a power law of the shear rate, $\xi_c \propto \dot{\gamma}^{-m}$, with $m\simeq 0.5$. Second, drawing insights from the fractal structure of clusters, we compute an effective volume fraction $\phi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and find that microstructural models adeptly account for the hydrodynamic stress contributions. We identify a critical shear rate $\dot{\gamma^*}$ and a critical volume fraction $\phi_{\mathrm{eff}}^{*}$, at which the clusters percolate to form a dynamical network.</description>

      <title>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurements of the Granular Density of Modes via Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jamming transition is an important feature of granular materials, with prior work showing an excess of low frequency modes in the granular analog to the density of states, the granular density of modes. In this work, we present an experimental method for acoustically measuring the granular density of modes using a single impact event to excite vibrational modes in an experimental, three dimensional, granular material. We test three different granular materials, all of which are composed of spherical beads. The first two systems are monodisperse collections of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter beads. The third system is a bidisperse mixture of the previous two bead sizes. During data collection, the particles are confined to a box; on top of this box, and resting on the granular material, is a light, rigid sheet onto which pressure can be applied to the system. To excite the material, a steel impactor ball is dropped on top of the system. The response of the granular material to the impact pulse is recorded by piezoelectric sensors buried throughout the material, and the density of modes is computed from the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation of these sensors. Our measurements of the density of modes show more low frequency modes at low pressure, consistent with previous experimental and numerical results, as well as several low frequency peaks in the density of modes that shift with applied pressure. Finally, we also see that the density of modes falls off at a wavelength on the order of twice the particle diameter, which is reminiscent of the Debye frequency.</description>

      <title>Versatile Capillary Cells for Handling Concentrated Samples in Analytical Ultracentrifugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In concentrated macromolecular dispersions, far-from-ideal intermolecular interactions determine the dispersion behaviors including phase transition, crystallization, and liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we present a novel versatile capillary-cell design for analytical ultracentrifugation-sedimentation equilibrium (AUC-SE), ideal for studying samples at high concentrations. Current setups for such studies are difficult and unreliable to handle, leading to a low experimental success rate. The design presented here is easy to use, robust, and reusable for samples in both aqueous and organic solvents while requiring no special tools or chemical modification of AUC cells. The key and unique feature is the fabrication of liquid reservoirs directly on the bottom window of AUC cells, which can be easily realized by laser ablation or mechanical drilling. The channel length and optical path length are therefore tunable. The success rate for assembling this new cell is close to 100%. We demonstrate the practicality of this cell by studying: 1) the equation of state and second virial coefficients of concentrated gold nanoparticle dispersions in water and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as well as lysozyme solution in aqueous buffers, 2) the gelation phase transition of DNA and BSA solutions, and 3) liquid-liquid phase separation of concentrated BSA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) droplets.</description>

      <title>Active transport of a passive colloid in a bath of run-and-tumble particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive colloid immersed in a bath of non-interacting and non-Brownian run-and-tumble microswimmers in two dimensions is analyzed using stochastic simulations and an asymptotic theory, both based on a minimal model of swimmer-colloid collisions characterized solely by frictionless steric interactions. We estimate the effective long-time diffusivity $\mathcal{D}$ of the suspended colloid resulting from its interaction with the active bath, and elucidate its dependence on the level of activity (persistence length of swimmer trajectories), the mobility ratio of the colloid to a swimmer, and the number density of swimmers in the bath. We also propose a semi-analytical model for the colloid diffusivity in terms of the variance and correlation time of the net fluctuating active force on the colloid resulting from swimmer collisions. Quantitative agreement is found between numerical simulations and analytical results in the experimentally-relevant regime of low swimmer density, low mobility ratios, and high activity.</description>

      <title>Stacked Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities grow drops into soft stalactite-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between thin film hydrodynamics and solidification produces formidably intricate geophysical structures, such as stalactites and icicles, whose shape is a testimony of their long growth. In simpler settings, liquid films can also produce regular patterns. When coated on the underside of a flat plate, these films are unstable and yield lattices of drops following the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. While this interfacial instability is well-studied in Newtonian fluids, much less is known about what happens when the thin film solidifies. Here, we coat the underside of a surface with liquid elastomer, allowing the film to destabilize and flow while it cures into an elastic solid. Once the first coating yields an array of solid droplets, this iterative coat-flow-cure process is repeated and gives rise to corrugated slender structures, which we name flexicles for their resemblance to icicles. We study the subtle combination of chaos and order that confers our flexicles, their structure, shape, arrangement, and, ultimately, deformability.</description>

      <title>Motility-Induced Pinning in Flocking System with Discrete Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a motility-induced pinning transition in the active Ising model for an active self-propelled particle system with discrete symmetry. This model was known to exhibit a liquid-gas type flocking phase transition, but a recent study reveals that the polar order is metastable due to droplet excitation. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that, for an intermediate alignment interaction strength, the steady state is characterized by traveling local domains, which renders the polar order short-ranged in both space and time. We further demonstrate that interfaces between colliding domains become pinned as the alignment interaction strength increases. A resonating back-and-forth motion of individual self-propelled particles across interfaces is identified as a mechanism for the pinning. We present an analytic argument for the motility-induced pinning transition by incorporating the resonance mechanism into the hydrodynamic theory. The resulting steady state consists of a network of pinned interfaces interconnected by particle currents. While the polar order is still short-ranged in space, the particle currents mediated by the pinned interfaces can exhibit long-range temporal correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive, in more general conditions, a recently introduced variance sum rule (VSR) [I. Di Terlizzi et al., 2024 Science 383 971] involving variances of displacement and force impulse for overdamped Langevin systems in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This formula allows visualising the effect of nonequilibrium as a deviation of the sum of variances from normal diffusion $2Dt$, with $D$ the diffusion constant and $t$ the time. From the VSR, we also derive formulas for the entropy production rate $\sigma$ that, differently from previous results, involve second-order time derivatives of position correlation functions. This novel feature gives a criterion for discriminating strong nonequilibrium regimes without measuring forces. We then apply and discuss our results to three analytically solved models: a stochastic switching trap, a Brownian vortex, and a Brownian gyrator. Finally, we compare the advantages and limitations of known and novel formulas for $\sigma$ in an overdamped NESS.</description>

Abstract: From understanding the sand on the beach to the foam on your beer, soft sphere simulations have been crucial to the study of the amorphous world around us. However, many of the materials we interact with on a daily basis aren't comprised of individual grains, but complex molecules and chains of polymers. By extending the soft sphere model to a model of linked spheres, we can learn more about the materials we interact with on a daily basis. In this methods paper, I show how one can find and study the physical properties of packings of flexible chains, rigid molecules, and everything in between. In addition to describing the energy landscape of these materials, these methods describe how to shear stabilize polymer packings, classify them in the jamming hierarchy, describe their elastic properties, and much more. This simple modification to soft sphere simulations has the potential to yield new discoveries surrounding glasses.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulation of deformable fluid-filled bodies: progress and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, among others, many scientists have invested significant efforts to model the flow of these fluid-filled bodies. Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods. For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice-Boltzmann method due to its specific ability to treat time and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary: fluid-structure and fluid-fluid methods. The fluid-structure methods are characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid-structure-based methods into two subcategories, those which treat the fluid-structure boundary as a continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid-fluid methods, particularly useful for the simulations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We focus on models for immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling of Clustering Instability for Interacting Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is one of the mayor collective phenomena observed in active matter. We study the overdamped motion of interacting active Brownian particles in two dimensions. An instability in the pair correlation function causes the onset of clustering. This clustering mechanism depends mainly on the self-propulsion properties of the active particles and details of the interactions do not effect the scaling of the clustering instability. Theoretical predictions from repeated ring-kinetic theory are confirmed by agent-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>
