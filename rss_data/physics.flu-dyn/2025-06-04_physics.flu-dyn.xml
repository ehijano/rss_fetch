      <title>Analytical solution for dynamic evaporation of liquid in isothermal condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical solution based on a diffuse interface model is presented for an isothermal evaporation problem under sub-saturation pressure. The macroscopic equations are derived from the free-energy method, widely recognized in the lattice Boltzmann literature, distinguishing our approach from conventional evaporation models that rely on jump conditions or pure kinetic theory. The interface behavior is fully described by differential equations, eliminating the need for assumptions such as local equilibrium at the interface. We derive an exact analytical solution for the inviscid case and propose an approximate solution when viscosity effects are considered. Our model unveils a novel relationship between evaporation rate and viscosity, providing new insights that have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. The analytical results are validated through numerical simulations using the open-source parallel library OpenLB, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the physical behavior of the evaporation phenomena within the framework of diffuse interface methods.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the VKI Plasmatron subsonic ICP jet combining optical emission spectroscopy, intrusive measurements, and CFD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the characterization of the subsonic flow in the 1.2~MW Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) wind tunnel at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI), targeting chamber pressures of 50 and 100~mbar, and input electric powers between 150 and 300~kW. Ultraviolet to near-infrared optical emission spectroscopy measurements of the free-jet flow are carried out with an updated experimental set-up, calibration procedure, and data processing, providing high-quality absolute spatially-resolved emission spectra. Emission measurements agree with thermochemical equilibrium predictions within a range of conditions, allowing to extract experimental maps of cold-wall heat flux and dynamic pressure against the inferred free-jet enthalpy. A detailed comparison with the characterization methodology traditionally employed is presented, highlighting the need for an improved modeling strategy. Using the measured free-jet temperature and dynamic pressure only, a forward procedure for the computation of the stagnation line flow is proposed. The latter agrees with intrusive heat flux measurements through a range of test conditions, and for values of the recombination coefficient of the reference copper probe commonly found in the literature. Results demonstrate that a consistent framework between numerical simulations and experimental data can be achieved, defining an improved framework for the characterization of the subsonic ICP jet.</description>

      <title>Transport of spherical microparticles in a 3D vortex flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles are common in biological and environmental flows and are widely used in industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Their motion and flow dynamics are strongly affected by interactions with the surrounding flow structure. While particle-flow interactions have been extensively studied in low Reynolds number (Re) flows as well as in fully developed turbulence, the transport mechanisms of these particles in intermediate flow regimes remain less explored. Here, we investigate the response of neutrally buoyant spherical particles to a single vortex flow field. Using a microfluidic cross-slot geometry, we generate a well-characterized, stationary, three-dimensional streamwise vortex at moderate $\text{Re}$ ($\sim 50$). Our experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, show that with increasing particle diameter, they are progressively excluded from the vortex core. Initially, small particles follow a Burgers vortex-like self-similar motion, but for larger particle diameters, deviations from this trend emerge due to fluid inertia and finite-size effects. These findings enhance our understanding of particle dynamics in vortical flows and have implications for microfluidic applications involving particle sorting and separation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced zeta potentials caused by surface ion mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep learning and iterative methods for accelerated solutions of viscous incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure Poisson equation, central to the fractional step method in incompressible flow simulations, incurs high computational costs due to the iterative solution of large-scale linear systems. To address this challenge, we introduce HyDEA, a novel framework that synergizes deep learning with classical iterative solvers. It leverages the complementary strengths of a DeepONet - capable of capturing large-scale features of the solution - and the CG or a PCG method, which efficiently resolves fine-scale errors. Specifically, within the framework of line-search methods, the DeepONet predicts search directions to accelerate convergence in solving sparse, symmetric-positive-definite linear systems, while the CG/ PCG method ensures robustness through iterative refinement. The framework seamlessly extends to flows over solid structures via the decoupled immersed boundary projection method. Crucially, the DeepONet is trained on fabricated linear systems rather than flow specific data, endowing it with inherent generalization across geometric complexities and Reynolds numbers without retraining. Benchmarks demonstrate superior efficiency and accuracy of HyDEA over the CG/PCG methods for flows with no obstacles, single or multiple stationary obstacles, and one moving obstacle - using fixed network weights. Remarkably, HyDEA also exhibits super-resolution capability: although the DeepONet is trained on a 128*128 grid for Re=1000, the hybrid solver delivers accurate solutions on a 512*512 grid for Re=10000 via interpolation, despite discretizations mismatch. In contrast, a purely data-driven DeepONet fails for complex flows, underscoring the necessity of hybridizing deep learning with iterative methods. Robustness, efficiency, and generalization across geometries, resolutions, and Reynolds numbers of HyDEA highlight its potential as a transformative solver for real world fluid dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>Should we care about the spatial heterogeneity in coral reefs under unidirectional turbulent flows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the similarities and differences observed between a hydraulically rough wall comprised of an array of cylinders, massive corals, and branching corals arranged in a staggered manner, along with a stochastically generated coral bed using a scale-resolving computational framework. Our data suggests that for all the flow parameters of interest, there is a substantial difference observed between the stochastic coral bed and the regularly arranged coral bed. By analysing the double-averaged statistics and time-averaged spatial heterogeneity in the hydrodynamic response, we explain the differences observed between the four cases that bring out significant local effects. These observations have important consequences for modelling coral-like roughness in numerical and experimental settings to better understand the mean flow statistics and the spatial heterogeneity induced as a consequence of the underlying coral geometry. Our results can help inform the coastal ocean modelling efforts to further improve the inclusion of coral heterogeneity within two-equation closure models by further investigating the impact of spatially stochastic, rough bottom boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Greedy recursion parameter selection for the One-Way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The One-Way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations use recursive filtering to construct efficient, well-posed one-way approximations to linear hyperbolic systems. The recursion parameters are critical to the accuracy and stability of the method, and have previously been chosen based on heuristic estimates of key eigenvalues (or their branches), which converges slowly and requires trial-and-error tuning for new systems. We review the projection and recursive OWNS formulations (OWNS-P and OWNS-R) for inhomogeneous equations and propose a greedy algorithm for parameter selection. We show that it converges faster and leads to a net decrease in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Inertia-driven propulsion of asymmetric spinner-dimers at moderate Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the translational motion of rotating colloidal systems at moderate Reynolds numbers (Re), focusing on particle dimers in snowman-like configurations under three scenarios: (i) two co-rotating spheres driven by an external field, (ii) two counter-rotating spheres driven by an internal torque as a swimmer, and (iii) a single rotating spinner with a passive sphere for cargo delivery, using hydrodynamic simulations. In all the three cases, the particles are bound together hydrodynamically, and the purely rotational motion of the spinners produces a net propulsion of the dimers along the axis of rotation due to a symmetry breaking. We demonstrate tunable dynamics, where the propulsion direction of the co-rotating dimer can be reversed by tuning the aspect ratio and Reynolds number, as well as cargo transport where a dimer consisting of a single spinner and a passive cargo particle can have a sustained locomotion due to broken head-to-tail symmetry of the overall flow fields. These findings highlight the critical role of inertia in creating locomotion from rotational motion and offer new avenues for controlling and optimizing translational motion in colloidal assemblies through rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and scalability of asynchronous compressible flow solver for transitional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the communication bottlenecks observed in state-of-the-art parallel time-dependent flow solvers at extreme scales, an asynchronous computing approach that relaxes communication and synchronization at a mathematical level was previously developed. This approach preserves high-order accuracy of computations near processing element boundaries using asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes while significantly improving the scalability. The numerical properties of the AT schemes were studied based on simple linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in previous works. Allowing asynchrony in numerical schemes can minimize communication overheads in a parallel setting in two ways: one that avoids communication over a few predetermined time steps, and the other that initiates communications without enforcing synchronization. In this study, the asynchronous algorithms are incorporated into the high-order compressible flow solver COMP-SQUARE, which solves practically relevant flow problems in complex geometries in a multi-block framework. The numerical efficacy and scalability of the two asynchronous algorithms are demonstrated for three test cases: isentropic advection of a vortex, the Taylor-Green vortex, and a much more sensitive case of the flow transitioning on a NACA0012 airfoil. Speed-ups of up to $4\times$ with respect to the baseline synchronous algorithm are observed in the scaling experiments performed on up to 18,432 cores. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of AT schemes on established CFD solvers to improve scalability at extreme scales as the scientific computing environment moves to the exascale era.</description>

      <title>Dynamical regimes of thermally convective emulsions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emulsions are paramount in various interdisciplinary topical areas, yet a satisfactory understanding of their behavior in buoyancy-driven thermal flows has not been established. In the present work, we unravel the dynamical regimes of thermal convection in emulsions by leveraging a large set of mesoscale numerical simulations. Emulsions are prepared with a given volume fraction of the initially dispersed phase, $\phi$, ranging from dilute (low values of $\phi$) to jammed emulsions (high values of $\phi$), resulting in different rheological responses of the emulsion, i.e., from Newtonian to non-Newtonian yield-stress behaviors, respectively. We then characterize the dynamics of the emulsions in the paradigmatic setup of the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, i.e., when confined between two parallel walls at different temperatures under the effect of buoyancy forces, the latter encoded in the dimensionless Rayleigh number Ra. We thoroughly investigated the dynamics of the emulsion in the changing of $\phi$ and Ra. For a given $\phi$, at increasing Ra, we observe that the emulsion exhibits convection states, where structural changes may appear (i.e., droplet breakup, coalescence or phase inversion), which inevitably impact the emulsion rheology. For sufficiently high values of Ra, two states of convection are observed: for low/moderate values of $\phi$ (Newtonian emulsions), we observe breakup-dominated dynamics, whereas for high values of $\phi$ (non-Newtonian emulsions), we observe phase-inverted states. For both scenarios, the droplet size distribution depends on Ra, and scaling laws for the average droplet size are analyzed and quantified. Our results offer insights into the rich dynamics of emulsions under thermal convection, offering the first detailed characterization of the various dynamic regimes to be expected and their relation with structural changes occurring in such complex fluids.</description>
