      <title>Forecasting High Frequency Order Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market information events are generated intermittently and disseminated at high speeds in real-time. Market participants consume this high-frequency data to build limit order books, representing the current bids and offers for a given asset. The arrival processes, or the order flow of bid and offer events, are asymmetric and possibly dependent on each other. The quantum and direction of this asymmetry are often associated with the direction of the traded price movement. The Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) is an indicator commonly used to estimate this asymmetry. This paper uses Hawkes processes to estimate the OFI while accounting for the lagged dependence in the order flow between bids and offers. Secondly, we develop a method to forecast the near-term distribution of the OFI, which can then be used to compare models for forecasting OFI. Thirdly, we propose a method to compare the forecasts of OFI for an arbitrarily large number of models. We apply the approach developed to tick data from the National Stock Exchange and observe that the Hawkes process modeled with a Sum of Exponential's kernel gives the best forecast among all competing models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and price impact in the fluid-limit of an order book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a Discrete Time Random Walk (DTRW) numerical scheme to simulate the anomalous diffusion of financial market orders in a simulated order book. Here using random walks with Sibuya waiting times to include a time-dependent stochastic forcing function with non-uniformly sampled times between order book events in the setting of fractional diffusion. This models the fluid limit of an order book by modelling the continuous arrival, cancellation and diffusion of orders in the presence of information shocks. We study the impulse response and stylised facts of orders undergoing anomalous diffusion for different forcing functions and model parameters. Concretely, we demonstrate the price impact for flash limit-orders and market orders and show how the numerical method generate kinks in the price impact. We use cubic spline interpolation to generate smoothed price impact curves. The work promotes the use of non-uniform sampling in the presence of diffusive dynamics as the preferred simulation method.</description>
