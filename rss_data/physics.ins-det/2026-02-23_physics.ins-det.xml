      <title>Development and Application of an eV Neutron Polarization for Parity Violation Studies at CSNS Back-n Beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic enhancement of symmetry-breaking effects in neutron-nucleus resonances provides a sensitive testing ground for Time-Reversal Invariance Violation (TRIV). Exploiting this mechanism, the Neutron Optics Parity and Time Reversal Experiment (NOPTREX) seeks to elucidate the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry. Critical to this effort is the precise measurement of Parity Violation (PV) asymmetries, which is essential to calibrate the nuclear parameters required for future TRIV experiments. To facilitate these studies, we developed an eV polarized neutron at the Back-n white neutron beamline of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Neutron polarization is generated by an in-situ Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) $^3$He filter. Spin manipulation is performed by an adiabatic spin flipper, while spin polarization is preserved over the flight path by a vacuum transport system equipped with a solenoidal guide field. Experiments successfully measured an asymmetry of approximately $7.8 \pm 2.4$ (stat.) $\pm 0.3$ (sys.) % at the 0.747 eV p-wave resonance of $^{139}$La. These results are in agreement with previous results on this resonance and validate the system's capability for PV measurements.</description>

      <title>3D-Deuteron Track Recoils Produced by Neutron Capture in Hydrogen Measured by MIMAC-35 cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture is a process that concerns most of the nuclei used to build our detectors. This process produces protons, alpha particles, and gamma rays which generate background signals. Characterizing this background is important for rare event searches, such as dark matter detection or Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS). This paper presents the result of the direct measurement of thermal neutron captures in hydrogen using a new MIcro-TPC MAtrix Chamber (MIMAC-35 cm) detector with a sensitive volume of 35 x 35 x 29 cm3. Data were collected over more than 5 days (443519 sec) with a gas mixture at 30 mbar of 70% isobutane (C4H10) and 30% trifluoromethane (CHF3). Our discrimination method is based on using 3D tracks and released ionization energy, in order to discriminate nuclear recoils (NR) from the dominant electron recoil (ER) background. This method enables the clear identification of 1.3 keV deuteron tracks resulting of nuclear capture reaction 1H(n, {\gamma})2H. We observed 51 neutron capture events among more than 11 million total events mainly produced by muons in the experimental room of our ground laboratory. In parallel we have measured the thermal neutron flux just below the chamber with a BF3 detector and a simulation has been performed to estimate the number of captures expected. This work shows the discrimination power of MIMAC search for low-energy (E &lt; 1 keV) rare event with a huge background without any shielding.</description>

      <title>Extended X-ray energy characterization of SIDDHARTA-2 large-area Silicon Drift Detectors up to 50 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DA$\Phi$NE collider of INFN-LNF performs high precision light kaonic atoms X-ray spectroscopy to investigate the kaon-nucleon(s) strong interaction in the low-energy (O(10 keV)) regime. A large area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) system has been developed to carry out these measurements. The collaboration aims to extend the measurements campaign to higher mass kaonic atoms, which exhibit transition lines at increased X-ray energies. In this context, the spectroscopic response of the SIDDHARTA-2 SDD system was investigated in terms of linearity and energy resolution up to 50 keV. An accuracy of the energy calibration procedure $\Delta E/E &lt; 10^{-3}$ was achieved.</description>

      <title>First Dark Photon Search Results from the Dandelion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first results from the Dandelion experiment, a directional detection, which searches for 1 meV dark photon dark matter. We use a spherical mirror to convert dark photons into standard millimeter-wavelength photons that can then be detected with an array of 221 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) cooled down to 150 mK within the KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) camera and operating between 150 and 350 GHz. We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $\chi$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength.</description>

      <title>Prompt Gamma Timing in Carbon Therapy: First Experimental Results with the TIARA Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of range monitoring for particle therapy, this study presents the first experimental results obtained with the TIARA detector using carbon-ion beams at the CNAO clinical center in Pavia, Italy. TIARA is based on the Prompt Gamma Timing (PGT) technique, which measures the time of flight (TOF) between incident ions and prompt gamma rays (PGs) emitted during nuclear interactions in the target. While the TIARA prototype has previously been validated with protons, carbons present a more challenging scenario due to their higher linear energy transfer, nuclear fragmentation products, and the continuous beam time structure of synchrotron accelerators. Experiments were performed by irradiating PMMA targets of different thicknesses with 200 MeV/u carbon beams. A coincidence time resolution of 279$\pm$35 ps FWHM was achieved, outperforming results previously obtained with protons at the same facility. A range accuracy of 4.74$\pm$0.36 mm at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level was measured at clinical intensity, when considering 5600 detected PGs, corresponding to the grouping of four irradiation spots of 2.4$\cdot$10$^6$ ions each. Overall, the results demonstrate that PGT-based range monitoring remains viable for carbon-ion beams, although increased background from secondary protons indicates that detector configuration adaptations are required.</description>

      <title>Development of a time calibration system for the KLM upgrade in the Belle II experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the stringent time calibration requirements for the Belle II experiment upgrade, particularly for its large-size KL and Muon Detector comprising tens of thousands of scintillator channels with time resolutions better than 100 ps, we developed a compact and high-speed time calibration system. The system utilizes a laser diode as its light source, integrated with a fast pulse laser drive circuit that employs high-speed switching GaN FETs and gate drivers. A prototype was constructed and rigorously evaluated using scintillators, achieving timing resolutions of about 13 ps for a single calibration channel. Furthermore, internal deviations among calibration channels were analyzed, with most measurements remaining within 250 ps. These results highlight the system's precision, scalability, and suitability for large-scale particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Precision Heavy Ion Detector for {\Lambda} Hypernuclei Lifetime Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy {\Lambda} hypernuclei lifetime. The detector employs the previously developed 10 picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation of prompt reaction products and delayed events from {\Lambda} hypernuclei decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton beams. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed design and provide a basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission detection.</description>

      <title>Studying AC-LGAD strip sensors from laser and testbeam measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the setup assembled to characterize and measure the spatial and timing resolutions of AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (AC-LGADs), using a 1060 nm laser source to deposit initial charges with a defined calibration methodology. The results were compared to those obtained with a 120 GeV proton beam. Despite the differences in the charge deposition mechanism between the laser and proton beam, the spatial and temporal resolutions were found to be compatible between the two sources after calibration. With 4D tracking detectors expected to play a vital role in upcoming collider experiments, we foresee this work as a way to evaluate the performance of semiconductor sensors that can augment testbeam measurements and accelerate R$\&amp;$D efforts. Additionally, simulation studies using Silvaco TCAD and Weightfield2 were carried out to understand the various contributing factors to the total time resolution in AC-LGAD sensors, measured using the laser source.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for $e/\pi^0$ Particle Classification in LArTPC Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient classification of electromagnetic activity from $\pi^0$ and electrons remains an open problem in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/\pi^0$ classification. The success of this first application indicates the broader promise of OT methods for LArTPC-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$ yr and $0.66$ yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>
