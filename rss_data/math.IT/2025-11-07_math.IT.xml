      <title>Environment Division Multiple Access (EDMA): A Feasibility Study via Pinching Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper exploits the dynamic features of wireless propagation environments as the basis for a new multiple access technique, termed environment division multiple access (EDMA). In particular, with the proposed pinching-antenna-assisted EDMA, the multi-user propagation environment is intelligently reconfigured to improve signal strength at intended receivers and simultaneously suppress multiple-access interference, without requiring complex signal processing, e.g., precoding, beamforming, or multi-user detection. The key to creating a favorable propagation environment is to utilize the capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure line-of-sight (LoS) links, e.g., pinching antennas are placed at specific locations, such that interference links are blocked on purpose. Based on a straightforward choice of pinching-antenna locations, the ergodic sum-rate gain of EDMA over conventional multiple access and the probability that EDMA achieves a larger instantaneous sum rate than the considered benchmarking scheme are derived in closed form. The obtained analytical results demonstrate the significant potential of EDMA for supporting multi-user communications. Furthermore, pinching antenna location optimization is also investigated, since the locations of pinching antennas are critical for reconfiguring LoS links and large-scale path losses. Two low-complexity algorithms are developed for uplink and downlink transmission, respectively, and simulation results are provided to show their optimality in comparison to exhaustive searches.</description>

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>

      <title>Efficient and rate-optimal list-decoding in the presence of minimal feedback: Weldon and Slepian-Wolf in sheep's clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a channel with length-$n$ inputs and outputs over the alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}$, and of which a fraction $\varrho \in (0,1-1/q)$ of symbols can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary, a fundamental problem is that of communicating at rates close to the information-theoretically optimal values, while ensuring the receiver can infer that the transmitter's message is from a ``small" set. While the existence of such codes is known, and constructions with computationally tractable encoding/decoding procedures are known for large $q$, we provide the first schemes that attain this performance for any $q \geq 2$, as long as low-rate feedback (asymptotically negligible relative to the number of transmissions) from the receiver to the transmitter is available. For any sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\varrho \in (1-1/q-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ our minimal feedback scheme has the following parameters: Rate $1-H_q(\varrho) - \varepsilon$ (i.e., $\varepsilon$-close to information-theoretically optimal -- here $H_q(\varrho)$ is the $q$-ary entropy function), list-size $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$, computational complexity of encoding/decoding $n^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\varepsilon))}$, storage complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^{\eta+1}\log n)$ for a code design parameter $\eta&gt;1$ that trades off storage complexity with the probability of error. The error probability is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\eta})$, and the (vanishing) feedback rate is $\mathcal{O}(1/ \log n)$.</description>

      <title>List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes Over Galois Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: List decoding of codes can be seen as the generalization of unique decoding of codes While list decoding over finite fields has been extensively studied, extending these results to more general algebraic structures such as Galois rings remains an important challenge. Due to recent progress in zero knowledge systems, there is a growing demand to investigate the proximity gap of codes over Galois rings in Yizhou Yao and coauthors(2025), Alexander Golovne and coauthors(2023), Yuanju Wei and coauthors(2025). The proximity gap is closely related to the decoding capability of codes. It was shown in Eli Ben-Sasson and coauthors(2020) that the proximity gap for RS codes over finite field can be improved to $1-\sqrt{r}$ if one consider list decoding instead of unique decoding. However, we know very little about RS codes over Galois ring which might hinder the development of zero knowledge proof system for ring-based arithmetic circuit. In this work, we first extend the list decoding procedure of Guruswami and Sudan to Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings, which shows that RS codes with rate $r$ can be list decoded up to radius $1-\sqrt{r}$. Then, we investigate the list decoding of folded Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings. We show that the list decoding radius of folded Reed-Solomon codes can reach the Singlton bound as its counterpart over finite field. Finally, we improve the list size of our folded Reed-Solomon code to $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ by extending recent work in Shashank Srivastava(2025) to Galois Rings.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: From Communication to Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been proposed as an effective waveform for achieving the full diversity of doubly-dispersive (delay-Doppler) channels. While this property is closely related to range and velocity estimation in sensing, this article focuses on other AFDM features that are particularly relevant for addressing two challenges in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems: (1) maintaining receiver complexity and energy consumption at acceptable levels while supporting the large bandwidths required for high delay/range resolution, and (2) mitigating interference in multiradar environments. In monostatic sensing, where direct transmitter-receiver leakage is a major impairment, we show that AFDM-based ISAC receivers can address the first challenge through their compatibility with low-complexity self-interference cancellation (SIC) schemes and reduced sampling rates via analog dechirping. In bistatic sensing, where such analog solutions may not be feasible, we demonstrate that AFDM supports sub-Nyquist sampling without requiring hardware modifications while preserving delay resolution. Finally, we show that the second challenge can be addressed by leveraging the resource-assignment flexibility of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) underlying the AFDM waveform.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Dynamics in Biofilms with Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A biofilm is a self-contained community of bacteria that uses signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to coordinate responses through the process of quorum sensing. Biofilms exhibit a dual role that drives interest in both combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and leveraging their potential in bioprocessing, since their products can have commercial potential. Previous work has demonstrated how the distinct anisotropic channel geometry in some biofilms affects AIs propagation therein. In this paper, a 2D anisotropic biofilm channel model is extended to be a time-varying channel (TVC), in order to represent the diffusion dynamics during the maturation phase when water channels develop. Since maturation is associated with the development of anisotropy, the time-varying model captures the shift from isotropic to anisotropic diffusion. Particle-based simulation results illustrate how the TVC is a hybrid scenario incorporating propagation features of both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid behavior aligns with biofilm maturation. Further study of the TVC includes characterization of the mutual information (MI), which reveals that an increased AI count, reduced transmitter -- receiver distance, greater degree of anisotropy, and shorter inter-symbol interference lengths increase the MI. Finally, a brief dimensional analysis demonstrates the scalability of the anisotropic channel results for larger biofilms and timescales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between MESP and 0/1 D-Opt and their upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish strong connections between two fundamental nonlinear 0/1 optimization problems coming from the area of experimental design, namely maximum entropy sampling and 0/1 D-Optimality. The connections are based on maps between instances, and we analyze the behavior of these maps. Using these maps, we transport basic upper-bounding methods between these two problems, and we are able to establish new domination results and other inequalities relating various basic upper bounds. Further, we establish results relating how different branch-and-bound schemes based on these maps compare. Additionally, we observe some surprising numerical results, where bounding methods that did not seem promising in their direct application to real-data MESP instances, are now useful for MESP instances that come from 0/1 D-Optimality.</description>

      <title>Limiting one-way distillable secret key via privacy testing of extendible states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other known efficiently computable bounds.</description>

      <title>Complexity as Advantage: A Regret-Based Perspective on Emergent Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers, providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Random Construction of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural randomness through small $2\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by integer-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By applying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized quantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each repair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of the overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks.</description>

      <title>On The Theory of Semantic Information and Communication for Logical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-Order Logic (FOL), also called first-order predicate calculus, is a formal language that provides a framework to comprehensively represent a world and its present state, including all of its entities, attributes, and complex interrelations, irrespective of their physical modality (e.g., text, image, or sensor data). Grounded in this universal representation, this paper develops a mathematical theory for semantic information and communication tailored to tasks involving logical reasoning and inference. For semantic communication, our framework distinguishes between two fundamental components: the physical cost of transmitting symbols of the FOL language and the logical content those symbols represent. A calibrated measure for semantic content is proposed, which allows for the consistent comparison of information value across different logical systems. This measure quantifies the degree to which a message reduces uncertainty about the true state of the world. Building on this measure, semantic entropy, conditional and mutual information metrics are defined. These metrics are then used to formulate optimizable objectives for semantic communication, designed to preserve the information most relevant for logical reasoning task at the receiver while adhering to a transmission budget. The framework's operational value is demonstrated through experiments in semantic compression, where the proposed objectives are used to manage the trade-off between transmission cost and the preservation of logical content; and deductive inference, where increasing world-state awareness improves deduction performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric for stochastic geometry based analysis of automotive radar networks called target {\it tracking probability}. Unlike the well-investigated detection probability (often termed as the success or coverage probability in stochastic geometry), the tracking probability characterizes the event of successive successful target detection with a sequence of radar pulses. From a theoretical standpoint, this work adds to the rich repertoire of statistical metrics in stochastic geometry-based wireless network analysis. To optimize the target tracking probability in high interference scenarios, we study a block medium access control (MAC) protocol for the automotive radars to share a common channel and recommend the optimal MAC parameter for a given vehicle and street density. Importantly, we show that the optimal MAC parameter that maximizes the detection probability may not be the one that maximizes the tracking probability. Our research reveals how the tracking event can be naturally mapped to the quality of service (QoS) requirements of latency and reliability for different vehicular technology use-cases. This can enable use-case specific adaptive selection of radar parameters for optimal target tracking.</description>

      <title>Transport of Event Equation: Phase Retrieval from Defocus Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>The (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of the non-Reed-Solomon (in short, non-RS) type linear code has been one of the research hotspots in recent years. In 2025, Hu et al. constructed some non-RS MDS codes by defining the (L, P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon code (in short, (L, P)-TGRS). In this paper, we focus on the (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code C. We firstly present a parity-check matrix. Secondly, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for C to be NMDS which partially answers two open problems proposed by Hu et al. in 2025, and prove that C is non-RS for 2k &gt; n which partially improves the corresponding result given by Hu et al. in 2025,. Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for C not to be self-dual or self-orthogonal, respectively, furthermore, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal codes which is a promotion of the corresponding result given by Ding et al. in 2025. Finally, some examples are given.</description>

      <title>Information-driven design of imaging systems</title>

Abstract: Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and produce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however, process raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As a result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their visual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information content, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not quantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific aspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with performance on secondary tasks.
  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly quantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By fitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics, our method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying gradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique for designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system performance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL matched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the prevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing algorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal performance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally efficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.
