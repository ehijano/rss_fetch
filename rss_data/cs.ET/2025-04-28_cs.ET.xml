      <title>Automated Routing-Informed Placement for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework. It features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. Compared to existing methods, our method can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, our method establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design, bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA. We will open-source our code.</description>

      <title>Enhancing short-term traffic prediction by integrating trends and fluctuations with attention mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the interaction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep learning models often struggle with these challenges because their architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model. Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness and precision of traffic prediction models.</description>

      <title>GRADE: Grover-based Benchmarking Toolkit for Assessing Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the potential to provide speedups in solving complex problems that are currently difficult for classical computers. However, the realization of this potential is hindered by the issue of current hardware reliability, primarily due to noise and architectural imperfections. As quantum computing systems rapidly advance, there exists a need to create a generalizable benchmarking tool that can assess reliability across different hardware platforms. In this paper, we introduce GRADE (Grover-based Reliability Assessment for Device Evaluation), an open-source benchmarking toolkit to evaluate the reliability of quantum hardware using a generalized form of Grover's algorithm.
  GRADE operates by implementing Grover's algorithm to search through a variety of primitive collections that are customizable by the user, analyzing the probability distribution of the results to assess accuracy and stability. This approach aims to evaluate the hardware performance of Grover's algorithm, which is fundamental in unordered search problems, making it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, as it is one of the few generalizable quantum algorithms that provide a direct speedup. Importantly, GRADE can adapt to a wide range of quantum computing platforms, ensuring it can be applied across different hardware architectures. Additionally, our work provides a scoring function for evaluating the hardware performance for multi-target Grover's implementation. Our work validates this approach across a multitude of simulators and hardware platforms from varying providers, demonstrating its adaptability to differing backend providers.</description>

      <title>LODAP: On-Device Incremental Learning Via Lightweight Operations and Data Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incremental learning that learns new classes over time after the model's deployment is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly for industrial edge systems, where it is difficult to communicate with a remote server to conduct computation-intensive learning. As more classes are expected to learn after their execution for edge devices. In this paper, we propose LODAP, a new on-device incremental learning framework for edge systems. The key part of LODAP is a new module, namely Efficient Incremental Module (EIM). EIM is composed of normal convolutions and lightweight operations. During incremental learning, EIM exploits some lightweight operations, called adapters, to effectively and efficiently learn features for new classes so that it can improve the accuracy of incremental learning while reducing model complexity as well as training overhead. The efficiency of LODAP is further enhanced by a data pruning strategy that significantly reduces the training data, thereby lowering the training overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny- ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that LODAP improves the accuracy by up to 4.32\% over existing methods while reducing around 50\% of model complexity. In addition, evaluations on real edge systems demonstrate its applicability for on-device machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/duanbiqing/LODAP.</description>

      <title>Practical Transmitters for Molecular Communication: Functionalized Nanodevices Employing Cooperative Transmembrane Transport Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel optically controllable molecular communication (MC) transmitter (TX) design based on vesicular nanodevices (NDs). The NDs are functionalized for the controlled release of signaling molecules (SMs) via transmembrane proteins. The proposed design contributes to overcoming the current barrier between MC theory and practical implementation, as all components of the system are chemically realizable. The NDs possess an optical-to-chemical conversion capability, therefore, the proposed NDs can be employed as externally controllable TXs in various MC systems. The proposed ND design comprises two cooperating modules, namely an energizing module and a release module, and, depending on the specific choices for the modules, allows for the release of different types of SMs. After introducing the general system model for the proposed realistic TX design, we provide a detailed mathematical analysis of a specific TX realization. In particular, we derive both an exact and a closed-form approximate analytical solution for the concentration of the released SMs and validate our results by comparison with a numerical solution. Moreover, we model the impact of a buffering medium, which is typically present in liquid environments, e.g., in experimental settings or in in-body applications. This allows the evaluation of the feasibility of our proposed TX design in practical chemical implementations. We consider various forms of parameter randomness occurring during vesicle synthesis, i.e., deviations which are unavoidable during experiments. We show that considering random distributions of the parameter values, such as the ND size, the number of incorporated proteins on the vesicle surface, and the vesicle membrane permeability, is crucial for an adequate kinetic analysis of the system.</description>

      <title>HyDra: SOT-CAM Based Vector Symbolic Macro for Hyperdimensional Computing</title>

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired paradigm valued for its noise robustness, parallelism, energy efficiency, and low computational overhead. Hardware accelerators are being explored to further enhance their performance, but current solutions are often limited by application specificity and the latency of encoding and similarity search. This paper presents a generalized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for HDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based content-addressable memory (SOT-CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates storage and computation, enabling in-memory execution of key HDC operations: binding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit shfiting), and efficient similarity search. Furthermore, a novel bit drop method-based permutation backed by holographic information representation of HDC is proposed which replaces conventional permutation execution in hardware resulting in a 6x latency improvement, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51X and 1.43x, respectively. To mitigate the parasitic effect of interconnects in the similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to ensure an accurate representation of the Hamming distance. Benchmarked at 7nm, the architecture achieves energy reductions of 21.5x, 552.74x, 1.45x, and 282.57x for addition, permutation, multiplication, and search operations, respectively, compared to CMOS-based HDC. Against state-of-the-art HDC accelerators, it achieves a 2.27x lower energy consumption and outperforms CPU and eGPU implementations by 2702x and 23161x, respectively, with less than 3% drop in accuracy.</description>

      <title>FEDORA: Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAvior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Design using a Progressive Widening Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits exhibit up to three times fewer CNOT gates, which is important for implementation on noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Dynamics Algorithms on the Advection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.</description>
