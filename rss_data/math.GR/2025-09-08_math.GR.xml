      <title>Hyperfiniteness of the boundary action of virtually special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any countable group acting virtually specially on a CAT(0) cube complex, the orbit equivalence relation induced by its action on the Roller boundary is hyperfinite. This can be considered as a generalization of hyperfiniteness of the boundary action of cubulated hyperbolic groups by Huang-Sabok-Shinko.</description>

      <title>Classification of Finite Groups With Equal Left and Right Quotient Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all finite groups $G$ which have the following property: for all subsets $A \subseteq G$, we have $|AA^{-1}| = |A^{-1}A|$. This question is motivated by the problem in additive combinatorics of More Sums Than Difference sets and answers several questions posed in arXiv:2509.00611 [math.NT].</description>

      <title>On Rota--Baxter operators on finite simple groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota--Baxter operators on groups were introduced by L. Guo, H. Lang, Yu. Sheng in 2020. In 2023, V. Bardakov and the second author showed that all Rota--Baxter operators on simple sporadic groups are splitting, i.\,e. they correspond to exact factorizations of groups. In 2024, the authors of the current paper described all non-splitting Rota--Baxter operators on alternating groups.
  Now we describe Rota--Baxter operators on finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type and projective special linear groups of degree two.</description>

      <title>Simple totally disconnected locally compact groups separated by finiteness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of simple non-discrete totally disconnected locally compact (tdlc) groups separated by finiteness properties; that is, for every positive integer $n$ there exists a simple non-discrete tdlc group that is of type $F_{n-1}$ but not of type $FP_n$. This generalizes a result of Skipper--Witzel--Zaremsky for discrete groups. Furthermore, we construct a simple non-discrete tdlc group that is of type $FP_2$ but not compactly presented. Our examples arise as Smith groups $\mathcal{U}(M, N)$ associated to pairs of permutation groups $M$ and $N$. We generalize a theorem of Haglund--Wise for a special case and show that under mild conditions the finiteness properties of $\mathcal{U}(M, N)$ reflect those of its local groups $M$ and $N$, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>The anabelian restricted Burnside problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,d \in \mathbb N$ and $w \in \mathbb F_n$ be non-trivial. We prove that the relatively free group of rank $d$ in the variety defined by the group law $w$ has a largest anabelian finite quotient and estimate its size. Here, a finite group is called anabelian if it has only non-abelian composition factors. The estimate is based on explicit bounds for the length of laws for finite simple groups obtained by Bradford and the author and on recent work by Fumagalli--Leinen--Puglisi.</description>

      <title>Subgroup perfect codes of $S_n$ in Cayley sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent, and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. Let $ G $ be a finite group, and let $ S $ be a square-free normal subset of $ G $. The Cayley sum graph of $ G $ with respect to $ S $ is a simple graph with vertex set $ G $ and two vertices $ x $ and $ y $ are adjacent if $ xy\in S .$ A subset $ C $ of $ G $ is called perfect code of $ G $ if there exists a Cayley sum graph of $ G $ that admits $ C $ as a perfect code. In particular, if a subgroup of $ G $ is a perfect code of $ G $, then the subgroup is called a subgroup perfect code of $ G $. In this work, we prove that there does not exist any proper perfect subgroup code of symmetric group $ S_n $. Using this result, we provide a complete characterization of the perfect subgroup code of the alternating group $A_n$.</description>

      <title>On the Graham--Sloane harmonious labelling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an order $n$ abelian group $G$ and a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. When is it possible to (bijectively) label $V(T)$ by $G$ so that along all edges $xy$ of $T$, the sums $x+y$ are distinct? This problem can be traced back to the work of Graham and Sloane on the harmonious labelling conjecture, and has been studied extensively since its introduction in 1980. We give a precise characterisation that holds for all bounded degree trees. In particular, our characterisation implies that if $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $T$ is a bounded degree tree, the desired labelling exists. This confirms a conjecture of Graham and Sloane from 1980, and another conjecture of Chang, Hsu, and Rogers from 1987, for bounded degree trees. Our results also have further applications for the study of graph coverings.</description>

      <title>On the growth of actions of free products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finitely generated group and $X$ a $G$-set, the growth of the action of $G$ on $X$ is the function that measures the largest cardinality of a ball of radius $n$ in the Schreier graph $\Gamma(G,X)$. In this note we consider the following stability problem: if $G,H$ are finitely generated groups admitting a faithful action of growth bounded above by a function $f$, does the free product $G \ast H$ also admit a faithful action of growth bounded above by $f$? We show that the answer is positive under additional assumptions, and negative in general. In the negative direction, our counter-examples are obtained with $G$ either the commutator subgroup of the topological full group of a minimal and expansive homeomorphism of the Cantor space; or $G$ a Houghton group. In both cases, the group $G$ admits a faithful action of linear growth, and we show that $G\ast H$ admits no faithful action of subquadratic growth provided $H$ is non-trivial. In the positive direction, we describe a class of groups that admit actions of linear growth and is closed under free products and exhibit examples within this class, among which the Grigorchuk group.</description>

      <title>Positivity and representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1802.02833 Guichard and Wienhard introduced the notion of $\Theta$-positivity, a generalization of Lusztig's total positivity to real Lie groups that are not necessarily split. Based on this notion, we introduce in this paper $\Theta$-positive representations of surface groups. We prove that $\Theta$-positive representations are $\Theta$-Anosov. This implies that $\Theta$-positive representations are discrete and faithful and that the set of $\Theta$-positive representations is open in the representation variety. We show that the set of $\Theta$-positive representations is closed within the set of representations that do not virtually factor through a parabolic subgroup. From this we deduce that for any simple Lie group $\mathsf G$ admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure there exist components consisting of $\Theta$-positive representations. More precisely we prove that the components parametrized using Higgs bundles methods in arXiv:2101.09377 consist of $\Theta$-positive representations.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the geodesic flow for groups with a contracting element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for a proper metric space endowed with a proper action by isometries of a group with a contracting element. We show that the existence of a contracting isometry is a sufficient evidence of negative curvature to carry in this context various results borrowed from hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we extend the so-called Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy proving that the geodesic flow is either conservative and ergodic or dissipative.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working toward an alternative method of deducing the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring. We show the comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction.
  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up to a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivials are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</description>
