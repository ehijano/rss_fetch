      <title>Wave-front tracking for a quasi-linear scalar conservation law with hysteresis II: the case of Preisach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the quasi-linear scalar conservation law \[u_t+\mathcal{F}(u)_t+u_x=0,\] where $\mathcal{F}$ is a specific hysteresis operator. Hysteresis models a rate-independent memory relationship between the input $u$ and its output, giving a non-local feature to the equation. In a previous work the authors studied the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the Play operator. In the present article, we extend the analysis to the case of Preisach operator, which is probably the most versatile mathematical model to the describe hysteresis in the applications, especially for the presence of some kind of internal variables. This fact has required a new analysis of the equation. Starting from the Riemann problem, we address the so-called wave-front tracking method for a solution to the Cauchy problem with bounded variation initial data. An entropy-like condition is also exploited for uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Well--posedness for the biharmonic scattering problem for a penetrable obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the direct scattering problem for a penetrable obstacle in an infinite elastic two--dimensional Kirchhoff--Love plate. Under the assumption that the plate's thickness is small relative to the wavelength of the incident wave, the propagation of perturbations on the plate is governed by the two-dimensional biharmonic wave equation, which we study in the frequency domain. With the help of an operator factorization, the scattering problem is analyzed from the perspective of a coupled boundary value problem involving the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations. Well--posedness and reciprocity relations for the problem are established. Numerical examples for some special cases are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay of global strong solutions to nematic liquid crystal flows in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behaviors of the higher-order spatial derivatives and the first-order time derivatives for the strong solution to nematic liquid crystal flows in the half-space $\mathbb{R}_+^3$. Furthermore, when the initial data lie in an appropriately weighted Sobolev space, we obtain the decay rates that are faster than the heat kernel. The main tools employed in this paper are the $L^p-L^q$ estimates of the Stokes semigroup, the a priori estimates of the steady Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}_+^3$, and the representation formula of the Leray projection operator.</description>

      <title>Generalized Poisson kernel and solution of the Dirichlet problem for the radial Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of the solution to the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the radial Schr\"odinger equation in the unit ball, with a complex-valued potential $V$ satisfying the condition $\int_0^1r|V(r)|dr&lt;\infty$. The solution is based on the construction of an explicit orthogonal set of solutions for the radial equation. In the case of a Dirichlet problem with boundary data in $W^{\frac{1}{2},2}(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, the solution is expressed as a series expansion in terms of the so-called formal spherical polynomials. We establish conditions for the solvability and uniqueness of the Dirichlet problem. Based on this series representation, we introduce the concept of generalized Poisson kernel, develop its main properties, and investigate the conditions under which the Dirichlet problem, with a boundary condition being a complex Radon measure on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, admits a solution in the sense of a distributional boundary values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An initial-and boundary-value problem for the Kelvin-Voigt system, modeling a mixture of n incompressible and viscoelastic fluids, with non-constant density, is investigated in this work. The existence of global-in-time weak solutions is established: velocity, density and pressure. Under additional regularity assumptions, we also prove the uniqueness of the solution.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for the randomly forced NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates exponential mixing of the invariant measure for randomly forced nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, with damping and random noise localized in space. Our study emphasizes the crucial role of exponential asymptotic compactness and control properties in establishing the ergodic properties of random dynamical systems. This work extends the series [15, 45] on the statistical behavior of randomly forced dispersive equations.</description>

      <title>On the sharp critical mass threshold for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well-known, the solution of the Patlak-Keller-Segel system in 3D may blow up in finite time regardless of any initial cell mass. In this paper, we are interested in the suppression of blow-up and the critical mass threshold for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via the Couette flow $(Ay, 0, 0)$. It is proved that if the Couette flow is sufficiently strong ($A$ is large enough), then the solutions for the system are global in time in the periodic domain $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{T}^{3}$ as long as the initial cell mass is less than $16\pi^{2}$. This result seems to be sharp, since the zero-mode function (the mean value in $x-$direction) of the three dimensional density is a complication of the two-dimensional Keller-Segel equations, whose critical mass in 2D is $8\pi$. One new observation is the dissipative decay of $(\widetilde{u}_{2,0},\widetilde{u}_{3,0})$ (see Lemma 4.3 for more details), then we combine the quasi-linear method proposed by Wei-Zhang (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 2021) with the zero-mode estimate of the density by the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality as Bedrossian-He (SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2017) or He (Nonlinearity, 2025) to obtain the bounded-ness of the density and the velocity.</description>

      <title>On local well-posedness for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with general power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation plays a fundamental role in mathematical physics, particularly in the study of quantum mechanics and Bose-Einstein condensation. This paper explores two distinct approaches to establishing the local well-posedness of solutions: the semigroup theory ansatz and the Strichartz estimates ansatz. Semigroup theory provides a general and elegant framework rooted in functional analysis, allowing for the interpretation of the time evolution of solutions as operator semigroups. Strichartz estimates, developed specifically for dispersive equations, offer an alternative technique based on refined space-time estimates and fixed-point arguments. We systematically analyze and compare both approaches and apply them to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations where the nonlinearity is given by $F(u)=\lambda|u|^p u$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. So our results extend beyond the physically relevant case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequality for degenerate fully nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider degenerate fully nonlinear parabolic equations, which generalize the p-parabolic equation with $p&gt;2$ to nondivergence form operators. We prove an intrinsic Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions and a weak Harnack inequality for nonnegative supersolutions. These results can be seen as the nondivergence form counterparts of the results by DiBenedetto, Gianazza and Vespri (Acta Math. 2008) and Kuusi (Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa 2008).</description>

      <title>Cazenave-Dickstein-Weissler-type extension of Fujita's problem on Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the critical exponents for the existence of global solutions to the equation \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle u_t-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=\int_0^t(t-s)^{-\gamma}|u(s)|^{p-1}u(s)\,ds,&amp;\qquad 0\leq\gamma&lt;1,\,\,\, {\eta\in \mathbb{H}^n,\,\,\,t&gt;0,} \end{array}\end{equation*} on the Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n.$ There exists a critical exponent $$p_c= \max\Big\{\frac{1}{\gamma},p_\gamma\Big\}\in(0,+\infty],\quad\hbox{with}\quad p_\gamma=1+\frac{2(2-\gamma)}{Q-2+2\gamma},\,\,Q=2n+2$$ such that for all $1&lt;p\leq p_c,$ no global solution exists regardless of the non-negative initial data, while for $p&gt;p_c$, a global positive solution exists if the initial data is sufficiently small. The results obtained are a natural extension of the results of Cazenave et al. [Nonlinear Analysis 68 (2008), 862-874], where similar studies were carried out in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Also given are several theorems concerning the lifespan estimates of local solutions for different cases of initial data. The proofs of the main results are based on test function methods and Banach fixed point principle.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Morse Index for the $p$-harmonic Approximation of Harmonic Maps into Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the joint work of the author with Da Lio and Rivi\`ere (Morse Index Stability for Sequences of Sacks-Uhlenbeck Maps into a Sphere) we studied the stability of the Morse index for Sacks-Uhlenbeck sequences into spheres as $p\searrow2$. These are critical points of the energy $E_p(u) := \int_\Sigma \left( 1+|\nabla u|^2\right)^{p/2} \ dvol_\Sigma,$ where $u:\Sigma \rightarrow S^n$ is a map from a closed Riemannian surface $\Sigma$ into a sphere $ S^n$. In this paper we extend the results found in our previous work to the case of Sacks-Uhlenbeck sequences into homogeneous spaces, by incorporating the strategy introduced by Bayer and Roberts (Energy identity and no neck property for $\epsilon$-harmonic and $\alpha$-harmonic maps into homogeneous target manifolds). In the spirit of the work of Da Lio, Gianocca and Rivi\`ere (Morse Index Stability for Critical Points to Conformally invariant Lagrangians), we show in this setting the upper semicontinuity of the Morse index plus nullity and an improved pointwise estimate of the gradient in the neck regions around blow up points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers (arXiv:2407.16507, arXiv:2408.05158) we presented results suggesting the existence of a new class of time-periodic solutions to the defocusing cubic wave equation on a one-dimensional interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here we confirm these findings by rigorously constructing solutions from this class. The proof uses rational arithmetic computations to verify essential operator bounds.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for a Sobolev critical quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with critical exponent:
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u-u\Delta (u^2)+\lambda u=\tau|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2\cdot2^*-2}u,~~~~x\in\R^N,
  \end{equation*}
  under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2dx=c$ for some prescribed $c&gt;0$. Here $\tau\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $\lambda\in\R$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier, $N\ge3$, $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $2&lt;q&lt;2\cdot2^*$. By deriving precise energy level estimates and establishing new convergence theorems, we apply the perturbation method to establish several existence results for $\tau&gt;0$ in the Sobolev critical regime:
  [label=(\alph*)]
  \item For the case of $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$, we obtain the existence of two solutions, one of which is a local minimizer, and the other is a mountain pass type solution, under explicit conditions on $c&gt;0$;
  \item For the case of $2+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}$, we obtain the existence of normalized solutions of mountain pass type under different conditions on $c&gt;0$;
  \item For the case of $4+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;2\cdot2^*$, we obtain the existence of a ground state normalized solution under different conditions on $c&gt;0$. 
Moreover, when $\tau\le 0$, we derive the non-existence result for $2&lt;q&lt;2\cdot2^*$ and all $c&gt;0$. Our research provides a comprehensive analysis across the entire range $q\in(2, 2 \cdot 2^*)$ and for all $N\ge3$. The methods we have developed are flexible and can be extended to a broader class of nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of the free-surface Stokes problem and an unconditionally stable explicit scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of ice sheet dynamics, mantle convection, lava flow, and other highly viscous free-surface flows involve solving the coupled Stokes/free-surface equations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the stability and conservation properties of the weak form of this system for Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids, at both the continuous and discrete levels. We perform the fully discrete stability analysis for finite element methods used in space with explicit and implicit Euler time-stepping methods used in time. Motivated by the theory, we propose a stabilization term designed for the explicit Euler discretization, which ensures unconditional time stability and permits conservation of the domain volume. Numerical experiments validate and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Dirichlet Boundary Condition with a Bounded Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w(0,x_2,t)=u(x_2,t)$, $x_1\in\mathbb R_+=(0,+\infty)$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u$ is a control belonging to a special subset of $L^\infty(\mathbb R\times (0,T))\cap L^2(\mathbb R\times (0,T))$. It is proved that each initial state belonging to $L^2(\mathbb R_+\times\mathbb R)$ is approximately controllable to an arbitrary end state belonging to $L^2(\mathbb R_+\times\mathbb R)$ by applying these controls. A numerical algorithm of solving the approximate controllability problem for this system is given. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Polynomial slowdown in space-inhomogeneous branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a branching Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which particles independently diffuse as standard Brownian motions and branch at an inhomogeneous rate $b(\theta)$ which depends only on the angle $\theta$ of the particle. We assume that $b$ is maximal when $\theta=0$, which is the preferred direction for breeding. Furthermore we assume that $b(\theta ) = 1 - \beta \abs{\theta }^\alpha + O(\theta ^2)$, as $\theta \to 0$, for $\alpha \in (2/3,2)$ and $\beta&gt;0.$ We show that if $M_t$ is the maximum distance to the origin at time $t$, then $(M_t-m(t))_{t\ge 1}$ is tight where $$m(t) = \sqrt{2} t - \frac{\vartheta_1}{\sqrt{2}} t^{(2-\alpha)/(2+\alpha)} - \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} - \frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{2}(2+\alpha)}\right) \log t. $$ and $\vartheta_1$ is explicit in terms of the first eigenvalue of a certain operator.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the generalized equator map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy, the $p$-energy ($p\in\mathbb{R}$ with $p\geq 2$) and the extrinsic $k$-energy ($k\in\mathbb{N}$) for maps between Riemannian manifolds are central objects in the geometric calculus of variations. The equator map from the unit ball to the Euclidean sphere provides an explicit critical point of all aforementioned energy functionals. During the last four decades many researchers studied the stability of this particular map when considered as a critical point of one of these energy functionals, see e.g. \cite{MR4436204}, \cite{MR705882}.
  Recently, Nakauchi \cite{MR4593065} introduced a generalized radial projection map and proved that this map is both a critical point of the energy and a critical point of the $p$-energy. This generalized radial projection map gives rise to a generalized equator map which is also both a critical point of the energy and a critical point of the $p$-energy.
  In this manuscript we first of all show that the generalized equator map is also a critical point of the extrinsic $k$-energy. Then, the main focus is a detailed stability analysis of this map, considered as a critical point of both the extrinsic $k$-energy and the $p$-energy. We thus establish a number of interesting generalizations of the classical (in)stability results of J\"ager and Kaul \cite{MR705882}.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev space theory for non-local elliptic and parabolic equations with non-zero exterior condition on $C^{1,1}$ open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a weighted Sobolev space theory for the non-local elliptic equation $$ \Delta^{\alpha/2}u=f, \quad x\in \mathcal{O}\,; \quad r_{\overline{\mathcal{O}}^c}u=g $$ as well as for the non-local parabolic equation $$ u_t=\Delta^{\alpha/2}u+f, \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in \mathcal{O} \,; \quad r_{\mathcal{O}}u(0,\cdot)=u_0, \,r_{(0,T)\times \overline{\mathcal{O}}^c}u=g. $$ Here, $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and $\mathcal{O}$ is a $C^{1,1}$ open set. We prove uniqueness and existence results in weighted Sobolev spaces. We measure the Sobolev and H\"older regularities of arbitrary order derivatives of solutions using a system of weights consisting of appropriate powers of the distance to the boundary.
  One of the most interesting features of our results is that, unlike the classical results in Sobolev spaces without weights, the weighted regularities of solutions in $\mathcal{O}$ are less affected by those of exterior conditions on $\overline{\mathcal{O}}^c$. For instance, even if $g=\delta_{x_0}$, the dirac delta distribution concentrated at $x_0\in \overline{\mathcal{O}}^c $, the solution to the elliptic equation given with $f=0$ is infinitely differentiable in $\mathcal{O}$, and for any $k=0,1,2, 3,\cdots$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $\delta\in (0,1)$, it holds that $$ |d_x^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}+\varepsilon+k}D^k_xu|_{C_b(\mathcal{O})} +|d_x^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}+\varepsilon+k+\delta} D^k_xu|_{C^{\delta}(\mathcal{O})}&lt;\infty, $$ where $d_x=dist(x, \partial \mathcal{O})$.</description>

Abstract: We derive several nonlinear a priori trace estimates for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which extend the current picture of higher derivative estimates in the mixed norm. The main ingredient is the blow-up method and a novel averaging operator, which could apply to PDEs with scaling invariance and $\varepsilon$-regularity, possibly with a drift.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong solutions for polymeric fluid-structure interaction of Oldroyd-B type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of weak solutions and a unique strong solution to the Oldroyd-B dumbbell model describing the evolution of a two-dimensional dilute polymer fluid interacting with a one-dimensional viscoelastic shell. The polymer fluid consists of a mixture of an incompressible viscous solvent and a solute comprising two massless beads connected by a Hookean spring with center-of-mass diffusion. This solute-solvent mixture then interacts with a flexible structure that evolves in time. An arbitrary nondegenerate reference domain for the polymer fluid is allowed and both solutions exist globally in time provided no future degeneracies occur with the structure deformation. Furthermore, weak-strong uniqueness holds unconditionally.</description>

      <title>On the Ashbaugh-Benguria type conjecture about lower-order Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality for lower order nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343-356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956) 633-636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863-879] gave a very important progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557-570]. It is easy to see that our conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Periodic Solutions for the 1d Cubic Wave Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-periodic solutions for the cubic wave equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We begin by following the perturbative construction of Vernov and Khrustalev and provide a rigorous derivation of the fourth-order expansion in small amplitude, which we use to verify the Galerkin scheme. In the main part, we focus on exploring large solutions numerically. We find an intricate bifurcation structure of time-periodic solutions forming a fractal-like pattern and explore it for the first time. Our results suggest that time-periodic solutions exist for arbitrary frequencies, with appearance of fine bifurcation structure likely related to the Cantor set families of solutions described in previous rigorous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that solutions to the Boltzmann equation without cut-off satisfying pointwise bounds on some observables (mass, pressure, and suitable moments) enjoy a uniform bound in $L^\infty$ in the case of hard potentials. As a consequence, we derive $C^{\infty}$ estimates and decay estimates for all derivatives, conditional to these macroscopic bounds. Our $L^\infty$ estimates are uniform in the limit $s \nearrow 1$ and hence we recover the same results also for the Landau equation.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.</description>

      <title>Suppression of blow-up for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via the Couette flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel system, regardless of whether they are parabolic-elliptic or parabolic-parabolic forms, finite-time blow-up may occur for arbitrarily small values of the initial mass. In this paper, it is proved for the first time that one can prevent the finite-time blow-up when the initial mass is less than a certain critical threshold via the stabilizing effect of the moving Navier-Stokes flows. In details, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the Couette flow $(Ay, 0, 0)$ in the Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system and show that if the Couette flow is sufficiently strong (A is large enough), then the solutions for Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system are global in time provided that the initial velocity is sufficiently small and the initial cell mass is less than $\frac{24}{5} \pi^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an interaction problem between an elastic plate and a compressible viscous fluid located between the rigid bottom $z=0$ and the plate. First, by utilizing the vertical fluid dissipation, we show that $\ln\eta(t) \in L^1$ for any $t&gt;0$ provided that $\ln\eta_0\in L^1$, ensuring that additional plate contact can form only on a set of a measure zero. Then, by utilizing the expanding capability of compressible fluid pressure, we show that all contact has to detach in finite time provided that the source force acting onto the plate is not pushing down excessively. Finally, we show that contact at any point can be detached in any given time with a strong enough source force localized around that point which is pulling the plate up. The results are based on a novel variational inequality which preserves key information about the total force applied onto the plate, even in presence of contact. This is the first result where detachment of contact is proven in fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Essentials of Real Analysis and Morrey-Sobolev spaces for second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs with singular first-order coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years we witness growing interest in using Real Analysis methods and results in the theory of nondivergence form partial differential equations (PDEs) and the goal of this article is to give a brief and concise introduction into the applications of several results in Real Analysis to the theory of elliptic and parabolic equations in Sobolev and Morrey-Sobolev spaces. In particular, we concentrate on such results as Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem, Fefferman-Stein theorem, theory of Muckenhoupt weights, and Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem and their role in Sobolev or Morrey-Sobolev space theory of parabolic equations with mixed norms.
  In our exposition we do not try to give the strongest known results for particular equations in particular spaces. We only show how the Real Analysis results, we present with all proofs, can be used in model cases such as the Laplace and the heat equations with singular first order terms. The only exception is the last section where we present relatively new results.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Derivation of the Wave Kinetic Equation for $\beta$-FPUT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave kinetic theory has been suggested as a way to understand the longtime statistical behavior of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system, with the aim of determining the thermalization time scale. The latter has been a major problem since the model was introduced in the 1950s. In this thesis we establish the wave kinetic equation for a reduced evolution equation obtained from the $\beta$-FPUT system by removing the non-resonant terms. We work in the kinetic limit $N\to \infty$ and $\beta\to 0$ under the scaling laws $\beta=N^{-\gamma}$ with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. The result holds up to the sub-kinetic time scale $T=N^{-\epsilon}\min\bigl(N,N^{5\gamma/4}\bigr)=N^{-\epsilon}T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{5/8}$ for $\epsilon\ll 1$, where $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$ represents the kinetic (thermalization) timescale. The novelties of this work include the treatment of non-polynomial dispersion relations, and the introduction of a robust phase renormalization argument to cancel dangerous divergent interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,\\ \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0. \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence and scattering for small and localized solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"{o}dinger system in three dimensions. The system consists of coupled semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations with quadratic nonlinearities. This model is motivated by the study of plasma oscillations arising from the Hartree equation near a translation-invariant equilibrium with the Coulomb potential. Our proof relies on the space-time resonance method. The main difficulty comes from the two dimensional space-time resonant set and the absence of null form structure.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there are no non-stationary (with respect to the Hawking vectorfield) real mode solutions to the Teukolsky equations on all $(3+1)$-dimensional subextremal Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We further prove that stationary solutions do not exist if the black hole parameters satisfy the Hawking-Reall bound and $\left|a\sqrt{-\Lambda}\right|&lt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{20}$. We conclude with the statement of mode stability which preludes boundedness and decay estimates for general solutions which will be proven in a separate paper. Our boundary conditions are the standard ones which follow from fixing the conformal class of the metric at infinity and lead to a coupling of the two Teukolsky equations. The proof relies on combining the Teukolsky-Starobinsky identities with the coupled boundary conditions. In the stationary case the proof exploits elliptic estimates which fail if the Hawking-Reall bound is violated. This is consistent with the superradiant instabilities expected in that regime.</description>

Abstract: We consider a dilute Fermi gas in the thermodynamic limit with interaction potential scattering length $\mathfrak{a}_0$ at temperature $T&gt;0$. We prove the 2nd order Huang-Yang approximation for the Fermi pressure of the system, in which there is a 2nd order term carrying the positive temperature efffect.Our formula is valid up to the temperature $T&lt;\rho^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}$, which is, by scaling, also necessary for the Huang-Yang formula to hold. Here, $T_F\sim\rho^{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the Fermi temperature. We also establish during the course of the proof, a conjecture regarding the second order approximation of density $\rho$ by R. Seiringer \cite{FermithermoTpositive}. Our proof uses frequency localization techniques from the analysis of nonlinear PDEs and does not involve spatial localization or Bosonization. In particular, our method covers the classical Huang-Yang formula at zero temperature.</description>
