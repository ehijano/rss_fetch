      <title>Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <title>Ground states of one-dimensional dipolar lattice bosons at unit filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed in state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Theory of the spectral function of Fermi polarons at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of Fermi polarons at nonzero temperature, including particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea shake-up to arbitrarily high orders. The exact set of equations of the spectral function is derived by using both Chevy ansatz and diagrammatic approach, and their equivalence is clarified to hold in free space only, with an unregularized infinitesimal interaction strength. The correction to the polaron spectral function arising from two-particle-hole excitations is explicitly examined, for an exemplary case of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional optical lattices. We find quantitative improvements at low temperatures with the inclusion of two-particle-hole excitations, in both polaron energies and decay rates. Our exact theory of Fermi polarons with arbitrary orders of particle-hole excitations might be used to better understand the intriguing polaron dynamical responses in two or three dimensions, whether in free space or within lattices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Study on Superexchange Dynamics of Composite Spin-1 Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental simulation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model with composite bosons in a one-dimensional chain based on the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Exploiting our site-and spin-resolved quantum gas microscope, we observed faster superexchange dynamics of the spin-1 system compared to its spin-1/2 counterpart, which is attributed to the enhancement effect of multi-bosons. We further probed the non-equilibrium spin dynamics driven by the superexchange and single-ion anisotropy terms, unveiling the linear expansion of the spin-spin correlations, which is limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. Based on the superexchange process, we prepared and verified the entangled qutrits pairs with these composite spin-1 bosons, potentially being applied in qutrit-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>
