      <title>Trade uncertainty impact on stock-bond correlations: Insights from conditional correlation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) on stock-bond correlation dynamics in the United States. Using daily data on major U.S. stock indices and the 10-year Treasury bond from 2015 to 2025, we estimate correlation within a two-step GARCH-based framework, relying on multivariate specifications, including Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC), Smooth Transition Conditional Correlation (STCC), and Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) models. We extend these frameworks by incorporating TPU index and a presidential dummy to capture effects of trade uncertainty and government cycles. The findings show that constant correlation models are strongly rejected in favor of time-varying specifications. Both STCC and DCC models confirm TPU's central role in driving correlation dynamics, with significant differences across political regimes. DCC models augmented with TPU and political effects deliver the best in-sample fit and strongest forecasting performance, as measured by statistical and economic loss functions.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Properties of Model Specification Tests for Multivariate Dynamic Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new multivariate model specification test that generalizes Durbin regression to a seemingly unrelated regression framework and reframes the Durbin approach as a GLS-class estimator. The proposed estimator explicitly models cross-equation dependence and the joint second-order dynamics of regressors and disturbances. It remains consistent under a comparatively weak dependence condition in which conventional OLS- and GLS-based estimators can be inconsistent, and it is asymptotically efficient under stronger conditions. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the associated Wald test achieves improved size control and competitive power in finite samples, especially when combined with a bootstrap-based bias correction. An empirical application further illustrates that the proposed procedure delivers stable inference and is practically useful for multi-equation specification testing.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry of the Stock Market from Graph Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the discrete Ollivier-Ricci graph curvature with Ricci flow to examine the intrinsic geometry of financial markets through the empirical correlation graph of the NASDAQ 100 index. Our main result is the development of a technique to perform surgery on the neckpinch singularities that form during the Ricci flow of the empirical graph, using the behavior and the lower bound of curvature of the fully connected graph as a starting point. We construct an algorithm that uses the curvature generated by intrinsic geometric flow of the graph to detect hidden hierarchies, community behavior, and clustering in financial markets despite the underlying challenges posed by a highly connected geometry.</description>
