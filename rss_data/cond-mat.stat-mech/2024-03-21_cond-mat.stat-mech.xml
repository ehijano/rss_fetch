      <title>Subspace restricted thermalization in a correlated-hopping model with strong Hilbert space fragmentation characterized by irreducible strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions in which a particle can hop between two neighboring sites only if the sites to the left and right of those two sites have different particle numbers. Using a bond to site mapping, this model involving four-site terms can be mapped to an assisted pair-flipping model involving only three-site terms. This model shows strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). We define irreducible strings (IS) to label the different fragments, determine the number of fragments, and the sizes of fragments corresponding to some special IS. In some classes of fragments, the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely, and in others it can be seen to have a structure characteristic of models which are not fully integrable. In the largest fragment in our model, the number of states grows exponentially with the system size, but the ratio of this number to the total Hilbert space dimension tends to zero exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Within this fragment, we provide numerical evidence that only a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) remains valid; we call this the subspace-restricted ETH. This is a modification of the usual ETH which combines the strong and weak versions of ETH and is also applicable to fragments of all dimensions. To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the model, we study the infinite-temperature time-dependent autocorrelation functions starting from a random initial state; we find that these exhibit a different behavior near the boundary compared to the bulk. We finally propose an experimental setup to realize our correlated-hopping model.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorization) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows for the retrieval of a previously stored path even after weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some foundations of a general theory of structure homogenization, meaning a theory of how any observable macroscopic field is related to spatial averages of its microscopic counterpart.
  I apply homogenization theory to the fields that appear in the vacuum theory of electromagnetism and deduce that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density is isotropic in the bulks of most materials, because it vanishes at every point. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic electric field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable.

      <title>Healing Regimes for Microscopic Wounds in the Vertex Model of Cell Tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wounds in epithelial tissues compromise their vital role in homeostasis. A rapid and efficient wound healing encompasses different mechanisms, which includes the formation of a contractile actin-myosin cable around its edge, known as the purse-string mechanism. We combine mean-field calculations and numerical simulations of the Vertex model to study the interplay between tissue properties and the purse-string mechanism and its impact on the healing process. We find different regimes, where the wound opens, closes partially or completely. We also derive an analytic expression for the closure time which is validated by numerical simulations. This study establishes under which conditions the purse-string mechanism suffices for closure, providing an analytical mean-field expression for the respective thresholds.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is the most relevant characteristic of systems of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized equation that embeds all of them.</description>

      <title>When faster rotation is harmful: the competition of alliances with inner blocking mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competitors in an intransitive loop of dominance can form a defensive alliance against an external species. The vitality of this super-structure, however, is jeopardized if we modify the original rock-scissors-paper-like rule and allow that the vicinity of a predator blocks stochastically the invasion success of its neighboring prey towards a third actor. To explore the potential consequences of this multi-point interaction we introduce a minimal model where two three-member alliances are fighting but one of them suffers from this inner blocking mechanism. We demonstrate that this weakness can be compensated by a faster inner rotation which is in agreement with previous findings. This broadly valid principle, however, is not always true here because the increase of rotation speed could be harmful and results in series of reentrant phase transitions on the parameter plane. This unexpected behavior can be explained by the relation of the blocked triplet and a neutral pair formed by a triplet member with an external species. Our results provide novel aspects to the fundamental laws which determine the evolutionary process in multi-strategy ecological systems.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the efficiencies of both classical and quantum heat engines using an Ising model as working fluid and the mean field equation for its non-equilibrium dynamics, formulated earlier\cite{acs,ac} to study the dynamical hysteresis and the dynamical phase transitions in the quantum Ising ferromagnets. We studied numerically the Ising magnet's nonintegrable coupled nonlinear first order differential equations of motion for a four stroke heat engine and compared the efficiencies in both classical and quantum limits using the quasi-static approximation. In both the pure classical and pure quantum cases, the numerically calculated efficiencies are much less than the corresponding Carnot values. Our analytical formulations of the efficiencies (both in pure classical as well as in pure quantum Ising heat engines) are found to agree well with the numerical estimates. Such formulations also indicate increased efficiency for the mixed case of a transverse field driven Ising engine in presence of nonzero longitudinal field. We also numerically checked and found that the efficiency of such a (mixed) quantum Ising heat engine can indeed have much higher efficiency for appropriate values of the transverse and longitudinal fields.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting with refractory periods: pathway formulation and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look into the problem of stochastic resetting with refractory periods. The model dynamics comprises diffusive and motionless phases. The diffusive phase ends at random time instants, at which the system is reset to a given position -- where the system remains at rest for a random time interval, termed the refractory period. A pathway formulation is introduced to derive exact analytical results for the relevant observables in a broad framework, with the resetting time and the refractory period following arbitrary distributions. For the paradigmatic case of Poissonian distributions of the resetting and refractory times, in general with different characteristic rates, closed-form expressions are obtained that successfully describe the relaxation to the steady state. Finally, we focus on the single-target search problem, in which the survival probability and the mean first passage time to the target can be exactly computed. Therein, we also discuss optimal strategies, which show a non-trivial dependence on the refractory period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure, and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive perturbative study of the operator spectrum in multi-scalar theories with hypercubic global symmetry. This includes working out symmetry representations and their corresponding tensor structures. These structures are then used to compute the anomalous dimensions of scalar operators with up to four fields and arbitrary representations to six-loop order. Moreover, we determine one-loop anomalous dimensions for a large number of low-lying operators in the spectrum which include more powers of the fundamental field and/or insertions of derivatives. As an aside we show how projectors used in the conformal bootstrap can be conveniently reused in computations of anomalous dimensions. The results of our study are of use to the conformal bootstrap. They also illuminate features of conformal perturbation theory and the large $n$ expansion. Our results may be of interest for various crossover phenomena in statistical field theory. In total, we compute the scaling dimension of more than 300 operators, of which 16 are computed to six-loops. Our analysis is exhaustive with respect to group theory up to rank 4 for any number of flavours $n$, and also exhaustive with respect to which representations exist for $n \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced transition in quantum many-body detection probability</title>

Abstract: With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values, single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium transitions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pulsed interactions unify reaction-diffusion and spatial nonlocal models for biological pattern formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a spatially-organized population distribution depends on the dynamics of the population and mediators of interaction (activators and inhibitors). Two broad classes of models have been used to investigate when and how self-organization is triggered, namely, reaction-diffusion and spatially nonlocal models. Nevertheless, these models implicitly assume smooth propagation scenarios, neglecting that individuals many times interact by exchanging short and abrupt pulses of the mediating substance. A recently proposed framework advances in the direction of properly accounting for these short-scale fluctuations by applying a coarse-graining procedure on the pulse dynamics. In this paper, we generalize the coarse-graining procedure and apply the extended formalism to new scenarios in which mediators influence individuals' reproductive success or their motility. We show that, in the slow- and fast-mediator limits, pulsed interactions recover, respectively, the reaction-diffusion and nonlocal models, providing a mechanistic connection between them. Furthermore, at each limit, the spatial stability condition is qualitatively different, leading to a timescale-induced transition where spatial patterns emerge as mediator dynamics becomes sufficiently fast.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent electron transfer and energy dissipation in condensed media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a moving adsorbate interacting with a metal electrode immersed in a solvent using the time-dependent Newns-Anderson-Schmickler model Hamiltonian. We have adopted a semiclassical trajectory treatment of the adsorbate to discuss the electron and energy transfers that occur between the adsorbate and the electrode. Using the Keldysh Green's function scheme, we found a non-adiabatically suppressed electron transfer caused by the motion of the adsorbate and coupling with bath phonons that model the solvent. The energy is thus dissipated into electron-hole pair excitations, which are hindered by interacting with the solvent modes and facilitated by the applied electrode potential. The average energy transfer rate was discussed in terms of the electron friction coefficient and given an analytical expression in the slow-motion limit.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of equilibrium phase transition in confined fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, adsorbed fluids in metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions due to a strong heterogeneous field. Considering a many-body problem in the presence of a nonuniform external field, we model the host-guest and guest-guest interactions in MOFs. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use the mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's f-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential thermodynamic functions to understand the distribution of intensive properties and integral thermodynamic functions to explain the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores experience a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids giving rise to a lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>
