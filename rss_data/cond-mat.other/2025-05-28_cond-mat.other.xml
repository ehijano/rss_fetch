      <title>Reconfigurable Defect States in Non-Hermitian Topolectrical Chains with Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), parity-time (PT) symmetry, and topological defect states in a finite non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. In the conventional NHSE regime, non-reciprocal hopping leads to an asymmetric localization of all eigenstates at one edge of the system, including the bulk and topological edge states. However, the introduction of staggered gain and loss restores the symmetric localization of topological edge states while preserving the bulk NHSE. We further examine the response of defect states in this system, demonstrating that their spatial localization is dynamically controlled by the combined effects of NHSE and PT symmetry. Specifically, we identify three distinct regimes in which the defect states localize at the defect site, shift to the system's edges, or become completely delocalized. These findings extend beyond previous works that primarily explored the activation and suppression of defect states through gain-loss engineering. To validate our theoretical predictions, we propose an experimental realization using a topolectrical circuit, where non-Hermitian parameters are implemented via impedance converter-based non-reciprocal elements. Circuit simulations confirm the emergence and tunability of defect states through voltage and admittance measurements, providing a feasible platform for experimental studies of non-Hermitian defect engineering. Our results establish a route for designing reconfigurable non-Hermitian systems with controllable topological defect states, with potential applications in robust signal processing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Zak Phase and Higher Winding Numbers in an Electroacoustic Cavity System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group approach to phonon modified criticality: anomalous dimension of strain and non-analytic corrections to Hooke's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between critical isotropic elasticity and classical Ising criticality using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach which is implemented such that the volume is fixed during the entire renormalization group flow. For dimensions slightly smaller than four we use a simple truncation of the FRG flow equations to recover the fixed points of the constrained Ising model: the Gaussian fixed point G, the Ising fixed point I, the renormalized Ising fixed point R, and the spherical fixed point S. We show that the fixed points R and S are both characterized by a finite anomalous dimension $y_{\ast}&lt;0$ of strain fluctuations, implying that the energy dispersion of longitudinal acoustic phonons exhibits a non-analytic momentum dependence proportional to $k^{1-y_{\ast}/2}$ for small momentum $k$. We also derive and solve flow equations for the free energy at constant strain and compute stress-strain relations in the vicinity of the fixed points. As a result, we reaffirm that Ising criticality, controlled by the fixed point I, is preempted by a bulk instability. Beyond that, we find that the stress-strain relation at R and S remains linear to leading order (Hooke's law), as long as the interaction between strain and Ising fluctuations is sufficiently weak. However, the finite anomalous dimension of strain fluctuations $y_{\ast}$ gives rise to non-analytic corrections to Hooke's law.</description>

      <title>Strain controlled g- to d-wave transition in altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of a strain-induced transformation from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism was recently recently proposed for MnTe using a $k\cdot p$ perturbative model. In this work, we demonstrate such a transition in CrSb for a wider array of strains, using a combination of a minimal model and first-principles calculations. Starting from a symmetry perspective, we analyze the spin elastoconductivity tensor, and determine the strain types which allow for a change in the altermagnetic symmetry. We obtain three strain directions, which allow for a $d$-wave type splitting, and one in which a net magnetic moment emerges. Using first-principles calculations in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we confirm these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, these results do not alter qualitatively in the presence of SOC. Finally, we reveal that the resulting spin currents give rise to a spin-splitter effect of up to 5\% under realistic strains of 1\%, confirming strain as a powerful tool for tuning altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements can be increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and off-the-shelf data acquisition systems. Compared to previous implementations of the lock-in principle, our solution offers real-time preview capabilities and is resource-efficient for long acquisition times at high sampling rates. Importantly, compared to high-end commercial lock-in instruments, our system offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude.</description>
