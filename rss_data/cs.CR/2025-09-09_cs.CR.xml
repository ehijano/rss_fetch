      <title>Towards Log Analysis with AI Agents: Cowrie Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of real-world attack data significantly hinders progress in cybersecurity research and education. Although honeypots like Cowrie effectively collect live threat intelligence, they generate overwhelming volumes of unstructured and heterogeneous logs, rendering manual analysis impractical. As a first step in our project on secure and efficient AI automation, this study explores the use of AI agents for automated log analysis. We present a lightweight and automated approach to process Cowrie honeypot logs. Our approach leverages AI agents to intelligently parse, summarize, and extract insights from raw data, while also considering the security implications of deploying such an autonomous system. Preliminary results demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness in reducing manual effort and identifying attack patterns, paving the way for more advanced autonomous cybersecurity analysis in future work.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Integration with Reinforcement Learning to Augment Decision-Making in Autonomous Cyber Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately 4,500 episodes faster than the baseline.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Samples Detection Based on Perturbation Discrepancy Consistency in Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of unvetted third-party and internet data renders pre-trained models susceptible to backdoor attacks. Detecting backdoor samples is critical to prevent backdoor activation during inference or injection during training. However, existing detection methods often require the defender to have access to the poisoned models, extra clean samples, or significant computational resources to detect backdoor samples, limiting their practicality. To address this limitation, we propose a backdoor sample detection method based on perturbatio\textbf{N} discr\textbf{E}pancy consis\textbf{T}ency \textbf{E}valuation (\NETE). This is a novel detection method that can be used both pre-training and post-training phases. In the detection process, it only requires an off-the-shelf pre-trained model to compute the log probability of samples and an automated function based on a mask-filling strategy to generate perturbations. Our method is based on the interesting phenomenon that the change in perturbation discrepancy for backdoor samples is smaller than that for clean samples. Based on this phenomenon, we use curvature to measure the discrepancy in log probabilities between different perturbed samples and input samples, thereby evaluating the consistency of the perturbation discrepancy to determine whether the input sample is a backdoor sample. Experiments conducted on four typical backdoor attacks and five types of large language model backdoor attacks demonstrate that our detection strategy outperforms existing zero-shot black-box detection methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Offloading for Large Language Models in 6G Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems. However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for resource-constrained vehicular environments.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Sublinear Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, essential for privacy and verifiable computation, suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prover typically uses memory that scales linearly with the computation's trace length T, making them impractical for resource-constrained devices and prohibitively expensive for large-scale tasks. This paper overcomes this barrier by constructing, to our knowledge, the first sublinear-space ZKP prover. Our core contribution is an equivalence that reframes proof generation as an instance of the classic Tree Evaluation problem. Leveraging a recent space-efficient tree-evaluation algorithm, we design a streaming prover that assembles the proof without ever materializing the full execution trace. The approach reduces prover memory from linear in T to O(sqrt(T)) (up to O(log T) lower-order terms) while preserving proof size, verifier time, and the transcript/security guarantees of the underlying system. This enables a shift from specialized, server-bound proving to on-device proving, opening applications in decentralized systems, on-device machine learning, and privacy-preserving technologies.</description>

      <title>ForensicsData: A Digital Forensics Dataset for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber incidents presents significant challenges for digital forensic investigators, especially in evidence collection and analysis. Public resources are still limited because of ethical, legal, and privacy concerns, even though realistic datasets are necessary to support research and tool developments. To address this gap, we introduce ForensicsData, an extensive Question-Context-Answer (Q-C-A) dataset sourced from actual malware analysis reports. It consists of more than 5,000 Q-C-A triplets. A unique workflow was used to create the dataset, which extracts structured data, uses large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance digital forensics by enabling reproducible experiments and fostering collaboration within the research community.</description>

      <title>Integrated Simulation Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on complex perception and communication systems, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. While simulation offers a scalable and safe environment for robustness testing, existing frameworks typically lack comprehensive supportfor modeling multi-domain adversarial scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, open-source integrated simulation framework designed to generate adversarial attacks targeting both perception and communication layers of AVs. The framework provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data, along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Ensembling Membership Inference Attacks Against Tabular Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a principled framework for auditing the privacy of synthetic data generated by tabular generative models, where many diverse methods have been proposed that each exploit different privacy leakage signals. However, in realistic threat scenarios, an adversary must choose a single method without a priori guarantee that it will be the empirically highest performing option. We study this challenge as a decision theoretic problem under uncertainty and conduct the largest synthetic data privacy benchmark to date. Here, we find that no MIA constitutes a strictly dominant strategy across a wide variety of model architectures and dataset domains under our threat model. Motivated by these findings, we propose ensemble MIAs and show that unsupervised ensembles built on individual attacks offer empirically more robust, regret-minimizing strategies than individual attacks.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Detection and Classification of Attacks on Surveillance Cameras under IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a rise in security related concerns regarding IoT Networks. The surveillance cameras in IoT networks are vulnerable to security threats such as brute force and zero-day attacks which can lead to unauthorized access by hackers and potential spying on the users activities. Moreover, these cameras can be targeted by Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, which will make it unavailable for the user. The proposed AI based framework will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect anomalous behavior, allowing for quick detection and response to potential intrusions. The framework will be trained and evaluated using real-world datasets to learn from past security incidents and improve its ability to detect potential intrusion.</description>

      <title>Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Exploiting Ethical Reasoning to Jailbreak LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Quantum AI Algorithm Development for Enhanced Cybersecurity: A Hybrid Approach to Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to enhance cybersecurity threat detection, particularly in the classification of malware and intrusion detection within high-dimensional datasets. Classical machine learning approaches encounter limitations when dealing with intricate, obfuscated malware patterns and extensive network intrusion data. To address these challenges, we implement and evaluate various QML algorithms, including Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM), and hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) for malware detection tasks. Our experimental analysis utilized two datasets: the Intrusion dataset, comprising 150 samples with 56 memory-based features derived from Volatility framework analysis, and the ObfuscatedMalMem2022 dataset, containing 58,596 samples with 57 features representing benign and malicious software. Remarkably, our QML methods demonstrated superior performance compared to classical approaches, achieving accuracies of 95% for QNN and 94% for QSVM. These quantum-enhanced methods leveraged quantum superposition and entanglement principles to accurately identify complex patterns within highly obfuscated malware samples that were imperceptible to classical methods. To further advance malware analysis, we propose a novel real-time malware analysis framework that incorporates Quantum Feature Extraction using Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Feature Maps, and Classification using Variational Quantum Circuits. This system integrates explainable AI methods, including GradCAM++ and ScoreCAM algorithms, to provide interpretable insights into the quantum decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation and Identity Tracing Prevention in AI-Driven Eye Tracking for Interactive Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization, ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63% accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.40%.</description>

      <title>ThreatGPT: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Public Safety through Threat Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe, such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers, safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about, such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&amp;CK, CVE reports, NIST, or CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information, but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local health service, this tool adapts to users' needs.

      <title>Behind the Mask: Benchmarking Camouflaged Jailbreaks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts, containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards, Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score. Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the responsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>What is Cybersecurity in Space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellites, drones, and 5G space links now support
  critical services such as air traffic, finance, and weather. Yet most
  were not built to resist modern cyber threats. Ground stations
  can be breached, GPS jammed, and supply chains compromised,
  while no shared list of vulnerabilities or safe testing range exists.
  This paper maps eleven research gaps, including secure
  routing, onboard intrusion detection, recovery methods, trusted
  supply chains, post-quantum encryption, zero-trust architectures,
  and real-time impact monitoring. For each, we outline the
  challenge, why it matters, and a guiding research question. We
  also highlight an agentic (multi-agent) AI approach where small,
  task-specific agents share defense tasks onboard instead of one
  large model.
  Finally, we propose a five-year roadmap: post-quantum and
  QKD flight trials, open cyber-ranges, clearer vulnerability shar ing, and early multi-agent deployments. These steps move space
  cybersecurity from reactive patching toward proactive resilience.</description>

      <title>Secure and Efficient $L^p$-Norm Computation for Two-Party Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure norm computation is becoming increasingly important in many real-world learning applications. However, existing cryptographic systems often lack a general framework for securely computing the $L^p$-norm over private inputs held by different parties. These systems often treat secure norm computation as a black-box process, neglecting to design tailored cryptographic protocols that optimize performance. Moreover, they predominantly focus on the $L^2$-norm, paying little attention to other popular $L^p$-norms, such as $L^1$ and $L^\infty$, which are commonly used in practice, such as machine learning tasks and location-based services.
  To our best knowledge, we propose the first comprehensive framework for secure two-party $L^p$-norm computations ($L^1$, $L^2$, and $L^\infty$), denoted as \mbox{Crypto-$L^p$}, designed to be versatile across various applications. We have designed, implemented, and thoroughly evaluated our framework across a wide range of benchmarking applications, state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryptographic protocols, and real-world datasets to validate its effectiveness and practical applicability. In summary, \mbox{Crypto-$L^p$} outperforms prior works on secure $L^p$-norm computation, achieving $82\times$, $271\times$, and $42\times$ improvements in runtime while reducing communication overhead by $36\times$, $4\times$, and $21\times$ for $p=1$, $2$, and $\infty$, respectively. Furthermore, we take the first step in adapting our Crypto-$L^p$ framework for secure machine learning inference, reducing communication costs by $3\times$ compared to SOTA systems while maintaining comparable runtime and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.</description>

      <title>FuzzBox: Blending Fuzzing into Emulation for Binary-Only Embedded Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coverage-guided fuzzing has been widely applied to address zero-day vulnerabilities in general-purpose software and operating systems. This approach relies on instrumenting the target code at compile time. However, applying it to industrial systems remains challenging, due to proprietary and closed-source compiler toolchains and lack of access to source code. FuzzBox addresses these limitations by integrating emulation with fuzzing: it dynamically instruments code during execution in a virtualized environment, for the injection of fuzz inputs, failure detection, and coverage analysis, without requiring source code recompilation and hardware-specific dependencies. We show the effectiveness of FuzzBox through experiments in the context of a proprietary MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) hypervisor for industrial applications. Additionally, we analyze the applicability of FuzzBox across commercial IoT firmware, showcasing its broad portability.</description>

      <title>SEASONED: Semantic-Enhanced Self-Counterfactual Explainable Detection of Adversarial Exploiter Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks have resulted in significant losses, often orchestrated through Adversarial Exploiter Contracts (AECs) that exploit vulnerabilities in victim smart contracts. To proactively identify such threats, this paper targets the explainable detection of AECs.
  Existing detection methods struggle to capture semantic dependencies and lack interpretability, limiting their effectiveness and leaving critical knowledge gaps in AEC analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce SEASONED, an effective, self-explanatory, and robust framework for AEC detection.
  SEASONED extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to construct a semantic relation graph (SRG), and employs a self-counterfactual explainable detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations that highlight the core attack logic. SCFED further enhances robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency by extracting representative information from these explanations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEASONED, which showcases outstanding detection performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency learning ability. To support further research, we also release a new dataset of 359 AECs.</description>

      <title>KnowHow: Automatically Applying High-Level CTI Knowledge for Interpretable and Accurate Provenance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level natural language knowledge in CTI reports, such as the ATT&amp;CK framework, is beneficial to counter APT attacks. However, how to automatically apply the high-level knowledge in CTI reports in realistic attack detection systems, such as provenance analysis systems, is still an open problem. The challenge stems from the semantic gap between the knowledge and the low-level security logs: while the knowledge in CTI reports is written in natural language, attack detection systems can only process low-level system events like file accesses or network IP manipulations. Manual approaches can be labor-intensive and error-prone.
  In this paper, we propose KnowHow, a CTI-knowledge-driven online provenance analysis approach that can automatically apply high-level attack knowledge from CTI reports written in natural languages to detect low-level system events. The core of KnowHow is a novel attack knowledge representation, gIoC, that represents the subject, object, and actions of attacks. By lifting system identifiers, such as file paths, in system events to natural language terms, KnowHow can match system events to gIoC and further match them to techniques described in natural languages. Finally, based on the techniques matched to system events, KnowHow reasons about the temporal logic of attack steps and detects potential APT attacks in system events. Our evaluation shows that KnowHow can accurately detect all 16 APT campaigns in the open-source and industrial datasets, while existing approaches all introduce large numbers of false positives. Meanwhile, our evaluation also shows that KnowHow reduces at most 90% of node-level false positives while having a higher node-level recall and is robust against several unknown attacks and mimicry attacks.</description>

      <title>Larger-scale Nakamoto-style Blockchains Offer Better Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional security models for Nakamoto-style blockchains overestimate adversarial coordination by assuming instantaneous synchronization among malicious nodes, neglecting the critical impact of internal communication delays on security. This paper introduces a dual-delay framework to revisit security analysis, addressing this oversight through two key innovations. First, the static delay model quantifies how adversarial communication delays (\(\Delta_a\)) constrain the effective growth rate of private chains, derived via an M/D/1 queuing model as \(\lambda_{eff} = \lambda_a / (1 + \lambda_a \Delta_a)\). This model reveals that the security threshold (\(\beta^*\)), the maximum adversarial power the system tolerates, increases with \(\Delta_a\), even exceeding the classic 51\% boundary when \(\Delta_a \textgreater \Delta\) (honest nodes' delay), breaking the long-standing 50\% assumption. Second, the dynamic delay model integrates probabilistic corruption and scale-dependent delays to characterize the total adversarial delay window (\(\Delta_{total} = \Delta(n) e^{-k\beta} + c \log(1 + \beta n)\)), where \(\Delta(n) \in \Theta(\log n)\) captures honest nodes' logarithmic delay growth. Asymptotic analysis shows adversarial power decays linearly with network scale, ensuring the probability of \(\beta \leq \beta^*\) approaches 1 as \(n \to \infty\). By exposing the interplay between network scale, communication delays, and power dilution, we provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing consensus protocols and assessing robustness in large-scale Nakamoto-style blockchains.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Introduces New Poisoning Attacks Yet Makes Them More Complicated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.
  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.</description>

      <title>Tell-Tale Watermarks for Explanatory Reasoning in Synthetic Media Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability.</description>

      <title>Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Secure and Trustful Cross-domain Communication with Decentralized Identifiers in 5G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of future mobile networks, there is a critical need for secure and trustful communication modalities to support dynamic interactions among core network components of different network domains. This paper proposes the application of W3C-endorsed Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to establish secure and trustful communication channels among network functions in 5G and subsequent generations. A new communication agent is introduced that integrates seamlessly with 5G-standardized network functions and utilizes a DID-based application layer transport protocol to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for cross-domain interactions. A comparative analysis of the two different versions of the DID-based communication protocol for inter network function communication reveals compatibility advantages of the latest protocol iteration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the communication overhead caused by both protocol iterations compared to traditional TCP/TLS shows the benefits of using DIDs to improve communication security, albeit with performance loses compared to TCP/TLS. These results uncover the potential of DID-based communication for future mobile networks but also point out areas for optimization.</description>

      <title>Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as &lt;meta&gt;, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</description>

      <title>Yours or Mine? Overwriting Attacks against Neural Audio Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative audio models are rapidly evolving, AI-generated audios increasingly raise concerns about copyright infringement and misinformation spread. Audio watermarking, as a proactive defense, can embed secret messages into audio for copyright protection and source verification. However, current neural audio watermarking methods focus primarily on the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking, while ignoring its vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we develop a simple yet powerful attack: the overwriting attack that overwrites the legitimate audio watermark with a forged one and makes the original legitimate watermark undetectable. Based on the audio watermarking information that the adversary has, we propose three categories of overwriting attacks, i.e., white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks. We also thoroughly evaluate the proposed attacks on state-of-the-art neural audio watermarking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overwriting attacks can effectively compromise existing watermarking schemes across various settings and achieve a nearly 100% attack success rate. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed overwriting attacks expose security flaws in existing neural audio watermarking systems, underscoring the need to enhance security in future audio watermarking designs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage. These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks.
  To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Number Theoretic Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) can be regarded as a variant of the Discrete Fourier Transform. NTT has been quite a powerful mathematical tool in developing Post-Quantum Cryptography and Homomorphic Encryption. The Fourier Transform essentially decomposes a signal into its frequencies. They are traditionally sine or cosine waves. NTT works more over groups or finite fields rather than on a continuous signal and polynomials work as the analog of sine waves in case of NTT. Fast Fourier Trnasform (FFT) style NTT or fast NTT has been proven to be useful in lattice-based cryptography due to its ability to reduce the complexity of polynomial multiplication from quadratic to quasilinear. We have introduced the concepts of cyclic, negacyclic convolutions along with NTT and its inverse and their fast versions.</description>

      <title>MemTraceDB: Reconstructing MySQL User Activity Using ActiviTimeTrace Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database audit and transaction logs are fundamental to forensic investigations, but they are vulnerable to tampering by privileged attackers. Malicious insiders or external threats with administrative access can alter, purge, or temporarily disable logging mechanisms, creating significant blind spots and rendering disk-based records unreliable. Memory analysis offers a vital alternative, providing investigators direct access to volatile artifacts that represent a ground-truth source of recent user activity, even when log files have been compromised.
  This paper introduces MemTraceDB, a tool that reconstructs user activity timelines by analyzing raw memory snapshots from the MySQL database process. MemTraceDB utilizes a novel algorithm, ActiviTimeTrace, to systematically extract and correlate forensic artifacts such as user connections and executed queries. Through a series of experiments, I demonstrate MemTraceDB's effectiveness and reveal a critical empirical finding: the MySQL query stack has a finite operational capacity of approximately 9,997 queries. This discovery allows me to establish a practical, data-driven formula for determining the optimal frequency for memory snapshot collection, providing a clear, actionable guideline for investigators. The result is a forensically-sound reconstruction of user activity, independent of compromised disk-based logs.</description>

      <title>Wrangling Entropy: Next-Generation Multi-Factor Key Derivation, Credential Hashing, and Credential Generation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF) offered a novel solution to the classic problem of usable client-side key management by incorporating multiple popular authentication factors into a key derivation process, but was later shown to be vulnerable to cryptanalysis that degraded its security over multiple invocations. In this paper, we present the Entropy State Transition Modeling Framework (ESTMF), a novel cryptanalytic technique designed to reveal pernicious leaks of entropy across multiple invocations of a cryptographic key derivation or hash function, and show that it can be used to correctly identify each of the known vulnerabilities in the original MFKDF construction. We then use these findings to propose a new construction for ``MFKDF2,'' a next-generation multi-factor key derivation function that can be proven to be end-to-end secure using the ESTMF. Finally, we discuss how MFKDF2 can be extended to support more authentication factors and usability features than the previous MFKDF construction, and derive several generalizable best-practices for the construction of new KDFs in the future.</description>

      <title>Dataset Ownership in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As datasets become critical assets in modern machine learning systems, ensuring robust copyright protection has emerged as an urgent challenge. Traditional legal mechanisms often fail to address the technical complexities of digital data replication and unauthorized use, particularly in opaque or decentralized environments. This survey provides a comprehensive review of technical approaches for dataset copyright protection, systematically categorizing them into three main classes: non-intrusive methods, which detect unauthorized use without modifying data; minimally-intrusive methods, which embed lightweight, reversible changes to enable ownership verification; and maximally-intrusive methods, which apply aggressive data alterations, such as reversible adversarial examples, to enforce usage restrictions. We synthesize key techniques, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight open research challenges. This work offers an organized perspective on the current landscape and suggests future directions for developing unified, scalable, and ethically sound solutions to protect datasets in increasingly complex machine learning ecosystems.</description>

      <title>DCMI: A Differential Calibration Membership Inference Attack Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation. It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from non-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed assumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example, achieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5, exceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG platforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the baseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and emphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We appeal to the community's consideration of deeper investigations, like ours, against the data leakage risks in rapidly evolving RAG systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xinyu140203/RAG_MIA.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Vulnerability and Physical Attacks on Online Map Construction for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition maps provide precise environmental information essential for prediction and planning in autonomous driving systems. Due to the high cost of labeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map construction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely updates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map construction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction models, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward predicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or merges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight boundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability persists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or targeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps. First, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's potential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding attacks and adversarial patch attacks. Evaluations on a public AD dataset demonstrate that our attacks can degrade mapping accuracy by up to 9.9%, render up to 44% of targeted routes unreachable, and increase unsafe planned trajectory rates, colliding with real-world road boundaries, by up to 27%. These attacks are also validated on a real-world testbed vehicle. We further analyze root causes of the symmetry bias, attributing them to training data imbalance, model architecture, and map element representation. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first vulnerability assessment of online map construction models and introduces the first digital and physical attack against them.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Service Provisioning for Dynamic UAV Clusters in Low-Altitude Economy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cluster services are crucial for promoting the low-altitude economy by enabling scalable, flexible, and adaptive aerial networks. To meet diverse service demands, clusters must dynamically incorporate a New UAVs (NUAVs) or an Existing UAV (EUAV). However, achieving sustained service reliability remains challenging due to the need for efficient and scalable NUAV authentication, privacy-preserving cross-cluster authentication for EUAVs, and robust protection of the cluster session key, including both forward and backward secrecy. To address these challenges, we propose a Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Cluster Authentication and Session Key Update (LP2-CASKU) scheme tailored for dynamic UAV clusters in low-altitude economy networks. LP2-CASKU integrates an efficient batch authentication mechanism that simultaneously authenticates multiple NUAVs with minimal communication overhead. It further introduces a lightweight cross-cluster authentication mechanism that ensures EUAV anonymity and unlinkability. Additionally, a secure session key update mechanism is incorporated to maintain key confidentiality over time, thereby preserving both forward and backward secrecy. We provide a comprehensive security analysis and evaluate LP2-CASKU performance through both theoretical analysis and OMNeT++ simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, LP2-CASKU achieves a latency reduction of 82.8%-90.8% by across different UAV swarm configurations and network bitrates, demonstrating strong adaptability to dynamic communication environments. Besides, under varying UAV swarm configurations, LP2-CASKU reduces the energy consumption by approximately 37.6-72.6%, while effectively supporting privacy-preserving authentication in highly dynamic UAV cluster environments.</description>

      <title>CSI-IBBS: Identity-Based Blind Signature using CSIDH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity-based cryptography (IBC), proposed by Adi Shamir, revolutionized public key authentication by eliminating the need for certificates, enabling a more efficient and scalable approach to cryptographic systems. Meanwhile, in \cite{Katsumata2024group}, Katsumata et al. were the first to present the blind signature protocol based on the hardness assumption of isogeny with provable security, which resembles the Schnorr blind signature. Building upon these foundational concepts, we propose an Identity-Based Blind Signature Scheme with an Honest Zero-Knowledge Verifier utilizing the CSIDH framework. This scheme combines blind signatures for privacy preservation with zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the verifier's honesty without revealing any additional information.
  Leveraging the quantum-resistant properties of CSIDH, a post-quantum secure scheme based on supersingular isogenies, our scheme offers strong protection against quantum adversaries while maintaining computational efficiency. We analyze the security of the introduced protocol in the standard cryptographic model and demonstrate its effectiveness in safeguarding privacy and verifier honesty. Furthermore, we present a performance evaluation, confirming the practical viability of this quantum-resistant cryptographic solution for privacy-preserving applications. This work advances the creation of secure, and scalable cryptographic systems for the post-quantum era.</description>

      <title>VehiclePassport: A GAIA-X-Aligned, Blockchain-Anchored Privacy-Preserving, Zero-Knowledge Digital Passport for Smart Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vehicles accumulate fragmented lifecycle records across OEMs, owners, and service centers that are difficult to verify and prone to fraud. We propose VehiclePassport, a GAIA-X-aligned digital passport anchored on blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification. VehiclePassport immutably commits to manufacturing, telemetry, and service events while enabling selective disclosure via short-lived JWTs and Groth16 proofs. Our open-source reference stack anchors hashes on Polygon zkEVM at &lt;$0.02 per event, validates proofs in &lt;10 ms, and scales to millions of vehicles. This architecture eliminates paper-based KYC, ensures GDPR-compliant traceability, and establishes a trustless foundation for insurance, resale, and regulatory applications in global mobility data markets.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Vulnerability Disclosure Policies of AI Vendors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI is increasingly integrated into products and critical systems, researchers are paying greater attention to identifying related vulnerabilities. Effective remediation depends on whether vendors are willing to accept and respond to AI vulnerability reports. In this paper, we examine the disclosure policies of 264 AI vendors. Using a mixed-methods approach, our quantitative analysis finds that 36% of vendors provide no disclosure channel, and only 18% explicitly mention AI-related risks. Vulnerabilities involving data access, authorization, and model extraction are generally considered in-scope, while jailbreaking and hallucination are frequently excluded. Through qualitative analysis, we further identify three vendor postures toward AI vulnerabilities - proactive clarification (n = 46, include active supporters, AI integrationists, and back channels), silence (n = 115, include self-hosted and hosted vendors), and restrictive (n = 103). Finally, by comparing vendor policies against 1,130 AI incidents and 359 academic publications, we show that bug bounty policy evolution has lagged behind both academic research and real-world events.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Intrusion Detection System Using a Hybrid CNN and ConvNeXt-Tiny Model for Internet of Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems across various domains such as industry, smart cities, healthcare, manufacturing, and government services has led to a significant increase in security risks, threatening data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Consequently, ensuring the security and resilience of IoT systems has become a critical requirement. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT environments, leveraging a hybrid model of CNN and ConvNeXt-Tiny. The proposed method is designed to detect and classify different types of network attacks, particularly botnet and malicious traffic, while the lightweight ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture enables effective deployment in resource-constrained devices and networks. A real-world dataset comprising both benign and malicious network packets collected from practical IoT scenarios was employed in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing training and inference time compared to more complex models. Specifically, the system attained 99.63% accuracy in the testing phase, 99.67% accuracy in the training phase, and an error rate of 0.0107 across eight classes, while maintaining short response times and low resource consumption. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and classifying attacks in real-world IoT environments, indicating that the lightweight architecture can serve as a practical alternative to complex and resource-intensive approaches in IoT network security.</description>

      <title>PLRV-O: Advancing Differentially Private Deep Learning via Privacy Loss Random Variable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration, (iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.</description>

      <title>AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.</description>

Abstract: The widespread distribution of Large Language Models (LLMs) through public platforms like Hugging Face introduces significant security challenges. While these platforms perform basic security scans, they often fail to detect subtle manipulations within the embedding layer. This work identifies a novel class of deployment phase attacks that exploit this vulnerability by injecting imperceptible perturbations directly into the embedding layer outputs without modifying model weights or input text. These perturbations, though statistically benign, systematically bypass safety alignment mechanisms and induce harmful behaviors during inference. We propose Search based Embedding Poisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully optimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP leverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to harmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window that evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP achieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for embedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies.</description>

      <title>From Perception to Protection: A Developer-Centered Study of Security and Privacy Threats in Extended Reality (XR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immersive nature of XR introduces a fundamentally different set of security and privacy (S&amp;P) challenges due to the unprecedented user interactions and data collection that traditional paradigms struggle to mitigate. As the primary architects of XR applications, developers play a critical role in addressing novel threats. However, to effectively support developers, we must first understand how they perceive and respond to different threats. Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of in-depth, threat-aware studies that examine XR S&amp;P from the developers' perspective. To fill this gap, we interviewed 23 professional XR developers with a focus on emerging threats in XR. Our study addresses two research questions aiming to uncover existing problems in XR development and identify actionable paths forward.
  By examining developers' perceptions of S&amp;P threats, we found that: (1) XR development decisions (e.g., rich sensor data collection, user-generated content interfaces) are closely tied to and can amplify S&amp;P threats, yet developers are often unaware of these risks, resulting in cognitive biases in threat perception; and (2) limitations in existing mitigation methods, combined with insufficient strategic, technical, and communication support, undermine developers' motivation, awareness, and ability to effectively address these threats. Based on these findings, we propose actionable and stakeholder-aware recommendations to improve XR S&amp;P throughout the XR development process. This work represents the first effort to undertake a threat-aware, developer-centered study in the XR domain -- an area where the immersive, data-rich nature of the XR technology introduces distinctive challenges.</description>

      <title>When Code Crosses Borders: A Security-Centric Evaluation of LLM-based Code Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for cross-language codebase migration, evaluating LLMs' security implications in translation tasks has become critical. Existing evaluations primarily focus on syntactic or functional correctness at the function level, neglecting the critical dimension of security.
  To enable security evaluation, we construct STED (Security-centric Translation Evaluation Dataset), the first dataset specifically designed for evaluating the security implications of LLM-based code translation. It comprises 720 security-related code samples across five programming languages and nine high-impact CWE categories, sourced from CVE/NVD and manually verified for translation tasks. Our evaluation framework consists of two independent assessment modules: (1) rigorous evaluation by security researchers, and (2) automated analysis via LLM-as-a-judge. Together they evaluate three critical aspects: functional correctness, vulnerability preservation, and vulnerability introduction rates.
  Our large-scale evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs across 6,000 translation instances reveals significant security degradation, with 28.6-45% of translations introducing new vulnerabilities--particularly for web-related flaws like input validation, where LLMs show consistent weaknesses. Furthermore, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based mitigation strategy that reduces translation-induced vulnerabilities by 32.8%, showing the potential of knowledge-enhanced prompting.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Sound and Precise Leakage Contracts for Open-Source RISC-V Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage contracts have been proposed as a new security abstraction at the instruction set architecture level. Leakage contracts aim to capture the information that processors may leak via microarchitectural side channels. Recently, the first tools have emerged to verify whether a processor satisfies a given contract. However, coming up with a contract that is both sound and precise for a given processor is challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone, as it requires in-depth knowledge of the timing side channels introduced by microarchitectural optimizations.
  In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing LeaSyn, the first tool for automatically synthesizing leakage contracts that are both sound and precise for processor designs at register-transfer level. Starting from a user-provided contract template that captures the space of possible contracts, LeaSyn automatically constructs a contract, alternating between contract synthesis, which ensures precision based on an empirical characterization of the processor's leaks, and contract verification, which ensures soundness.
  Using LeaSyn, we automatically synthesize contracts for six open-source RISC-V CPUs for a variety of contract templates. Our experiments indicate that LeaSyn's contracts are sound and more precise (i.e., represent the actual leaks in the target processor more faithfully) than contracts constructed by existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Signal-Based Malware Classification Using 1D CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These images can then be classified based on their textural information using computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise, caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format. It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of 0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to operate on the proposed signal modality.</description>

      <title>Super-Quadratic Quantum Speed-ups and Guessing Many Likely Keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of guessing cryptographic keys, drawn from some non-uniform probability distribution $D$, as e.g. in LPN, LWE or for passwords. The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order of likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a sophisticated Grover search.
  We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its runtime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\alpha}(\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy with parameter $\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an information theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so far been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the runtime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) &lt; H_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a super-quadratic quantum speed-up $s&gt;2$ over classical key guessing.
  As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in a multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys sampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction of them. For product distributions $D = \chi^n$, we show that any constant fraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$ quantumly per key, where $H(\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast, Arikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$ classically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) &lt; H_{2/3}(D) &lt; H_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key is substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and quantumly.</description>

Abstract: In 2019, V. A. Roman'kov introduced the concept of marginal sets for groups. He developed a theory of marginal sets and demonstrated how these sets can be applied to improve some key exchange schemes. In this paper, we extend his ideas and introduce the concept of marginal sets for semigroups and semirings. For tropical matrix semigroups and semirings, we describe how some marginal sets can be constructed. We apply marginal sets to improve some key exchange schemes over semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data exfiltration is a growing problem for business who face costs related to the loss of confidential data as well as potential extortion. This work presents a simple game theoretic model of network data exfiltration. In the model, the attacker chooses the exfiltration route and speed, and the defender selects monitoring thresholds to detect unusual activity. The attacker is rewarded for exfiltrating data, and the defender tries to minimize the costs of data loss and of responding to alerts.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Server: A Systematic Study of Parasitic Toolchain Attacks on the MCP Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes tool invocation and has rapidly become a backbone for LLM-powered applications. While this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental security shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to autonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack surface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to hijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of attacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy Disclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction; instead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources that LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the toolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection, and Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data. Our root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and least-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate unchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design MCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem, analyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP ecosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods, underscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense mechanisms in LLM-integrated environments.</description>

      <title>LLMs in Cybersecurity: Friend or Foe in the Human Decision Loop?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming human decision-making by acting as cognitive collaborators. Yet, this promise comes with a paradox: while LLMs can improve accuracy, they may also erode independent reasoning, promote over-reliance and homogenize decisions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs shape human judgment in security-critical contexts. Through two exploratory focus groups (unaided and LLM-supported), we assess decision accuracy, behavioral resilience and reliance dynamics. Our findings reveal that while LLMs enhance accuracy and consistency in routine decisions, they can inadvertently reduce cognitive diversity and improve automation bias, which is especially the case among users with lower resilience. In contrast, high-resilience individuals leverage LLMs more effectively, suggesting that cognitive traits mediate AI benefit.</description>

      <title>A Secure Sequencer and Data Availability Committee for Rollups (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains face a scalability limitation, partly due to the throughput limitations of consensus protocols, especially when aiming to obtain a high degree of decentralization. Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to conventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using minimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer is a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these transactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing needs less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data availability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their corresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and DACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential security threat and delaying L2 adoption. We propose in this paper fraud-proof mechanisms, arbitrated by L1 contracts, to detect and generate evidence of dishonest behavior of the sequencer and DAC. We study how these fraud-proofs limit the power of adversaries that control different number of sequencer and DACs members, and provide incentives for their honest behavior. We designed these fraud-proof mechanisms as two player games. Unlike the generic fraud-proofs in current L2s (designed to guarantee the correct execution of transactions), our fraud-proofs are over pred-etermined algorithms that verify the properties that determine the correctness of the DAC. Arbitrating over concrete algorithms makes our fraud-proofs more efficient, easier to understand, and simpler to prove correct. We provide as an artifact a mechanization in LEAN4 of our fraud-proof games, including (1) the verified strategies that honest players should play to win all games as well as (2) mechanisms to detect dishonest claims.</description>

      <title>Network-level Censorship Attacks in the InterPlanetary File System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has been successfully established as the de facto standard for decentralized data storage in the emerging Web3. Despite its decentralized nature, IPFS nodes, as well as IPFS content providers, have converged to centralization in large public clouds. Centralization introduces BGP routing-based attacks, such as passive interception and BGP hijacking, as potential threats. Although this attack vector has been investigated for many other Web3 protocols, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been analyzed for the IPFS network. In our work, we bridge this gap and demonstrate that BGP routing attacks can be effectively leveraged to censor content in IPFS. For the analysis, we collected 3,000 content blocks called CIDs and conducted a simulation of BGP hijacking and passive interception against them. We find that a single malicious AS can censor 75% of the IPFS content for more than 57% of all requester nodes. Furthermore, we show that even with a small set of only 62 hijacked prefixes, 70% of the full attack effectiveness can already be reached. We further propose and validate countermeasures based on global collaborative content replication among all nodes in the IPFS network, together with additional robust backup content provider nodes that are well-hardened against BGP hijacking. We hope this work raises awareness about the threat BGP routing-based attacks pose to IPFS and triggers further efforts to harden the live IPFS network against them.</description>

      <title>When Secure Isn't: Assessing the Security of Machine Learning Model Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best, often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy, despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Image Encryption Scheme Based on Hyper-Chaotic Map and Self-Adaptive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, image encryption technology acts as a safeguard, preventing unauthorized access to images. This paper proposes an innovative image encryption scheme that integrates a novel 2D hyper-chaotic map with a newly developed self-adaptive diffusion method. The 2D hyper-chaotic map, namely the 2D-RA map, is designed by hybridizing the Rastrigin and Ackley functions. The chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map is validated through a series of measurements, including the Bifurcation Diagram, Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Initial Value Sensitivity, 0 - 1 Test, Correlation Dimension (CD), and Kolmogorov Entropy (KE). The results demonstrate that the chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map surpasses that of existing advanced chaotic functions. Additionally, the self-adaptive diffusion method is employed to enhance the uniformity of grayscale distribution. The performance of the image encryption scheme is evaluated using a series of indicators. The results show that the proposed image encryption scheme significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art image encryption techniques.</description>

      <title>Imitative Membership Inference Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a target machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were part of the training set. State-of-the-art MIAs rely on training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model, leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>An Ethically Grounded LLM-Based Approach to Insider Threat Synthesis and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic AI for Cybersecurity: State of the Art, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit fundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to non-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding analyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gradient Variance and Differential Privacy in Quantum Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon integrating Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as the local model, Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) has recently confronted notable challenges. Firstly, exploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance. Secondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable model transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible to attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is vulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states, since it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This local noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training, impairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we propose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and introduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the impact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise generation scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing gradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances convergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of intermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection. Using real-world datasets, we achieved test accuracy of up to 98.47\% for the MNIST dataset and 83.85\% for the CIFAR-10 dataset while maintaining fast execution times.</description>

Abstract: This systematic literature review analyzes the current state of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 in autonomous robotic systems, focusing on cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies. Using the PRISMA protocol, 22 studies were selected from 243 initial records across IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Findings reveal partial regulatory alignment: while progress has been made in risk management and encrypted communications, significant gaps persist in explainability modules, real-time human oversight, and knowledge base traceability. Only 40% of reviewed solutions explicitly address transparency requirements, and 30% implement failure intervention mechanisms. The study concludes that modular approaches integrating risk, supervision, and continuous auditing are essential to meet the AI Act mandates in autonomous robotics.</description>

      <title>User Privacy and Large Language Models: An Analysis of Frontier Developers' Privacy Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models. Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies. We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered chatbots.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy.

      <title>Bi-Level Game-Theoretic Planning of Cyber Deception for Cognitive Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive vulnerabilities shape human decision-making and arise primarily from two sources: (1) cognitive capabilities, which include disparities in knowledge, education, expertise, or access to information, and (2) cognitive biases, such as rational inattention, confirmation bias, and base rate neglect, which influence how individuals perceive and process information. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to gain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This paper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that leverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the proposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on "strategic-level" design for defensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates "operational-level" actions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the cross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage strategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's initial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed deception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive one during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total rewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even small initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and secure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the attacker's lifecycle.</description>

      <title>GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study of Code Large Language Models for Binary Security Patch Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual cross-talk in superconducting qubit devices creates a security vulnerability for emerging quantum cloud services. We demonstrate a Clifford-only Quantum Rowhammer attack-using just X and CNOT gates-that injects faults on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processors without requiring pulse-level access. Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing becomes standard.</description>

      <title>Multi View Slot Attention Using Paraphrased Texts For Face Anti-Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens, failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text. MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

      <title>Mask-GCG: Are All Tokens in Adversarial Suffixes Necessary for Jailbreak Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix. Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts. Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>NeuroDeX: Unlocking Diverse Support in Decompiling Deep Neural Network Executables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models. NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more comprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables decompilers.</description>

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity. While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.</description>

      <title>EPT Benchmark: Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies. However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore, our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Rezamirbagheri110/EPT-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}. Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity: fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose \textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality, rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic, integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings: \emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Systematic Assessment of Tabular Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data synthesis has been advocated as an important approach for utilizing data while protecting data privacy. In recent years, a plethora of tabular data synthesis algorithms (i.e., synthesizers) have been proposed. Some synthesizers satisfy Differential Privacy, while others aim to provide privacy in a heuristic fashion. A comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these synthesizers remains elusive due to drawbacks in evaluation metrics and missing head-to-head comparisons of newly developed synthesizers that take advantage of diffusion models and large language models with state-of-the-art statistical synthesizers. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation framework for assessing tabular data synthesis algorithms. Specifically, we examine and critique existing evaluation metrics, and introduce a set of new metrics in terms of fidelity, privacy, and utility to address their limitations. We conducted extensive evaluations of 8 different types of synthesizers on 12 real-world datasets and identified some interesting findings, which offer new directions for privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>

      <title>XChainWatcher: Monitoring and Identifying Attacks in Cross-Chain Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-chain bridges are a type of middleware for blockchain interoperability that supports the transfer of assets and data across blockchains. However, several of these bridges have vulnerabilities that have caused 3.2 billion dollars in losses since May 2021. Some studies have revealed the existence of these vulnerabilities, but there is little quantitative research available, and there are no safeguard mechanisms to protect bridges from such attacks. Furthermore, no studies are available on the practices of cross-chain bridges that can cause financial losses. We propose \toolName~(Cross-Chain Watcher), a modular and extensible logic-driven anomaly detector for cross-chain bridges. It operates in three main phases: (1) decoding events and transactions from multiple blockchains, (2) building logic relations from the extracted data, and (3) evaluating these relations against a set of detection rules. Using \toolName, we analyze data from two previously attacked bridges: the Ronin and Nomad bridges. \toolName~was able to successfully identify the transactions that led to losses of \$611M and \$190M (USD) and surpassed the results obtained by a reputable security firm in the latter. We not only uncover successful attacks, but also reveal other anomalies, such as 37 cross-chain transactions (\CCTX) that these bridges should not have accepted, failed attempts to exploit Nomad, over \$7.8M worth of tokens locked on one chain but never released on Ethereum, and \$200K lost by users due to inadequate interaction with bridges. We provide the first open dataset of 81,000 \CCTXS~across three blockchains, capturing more than \$4.2B in token transfers.</description>

      <title>$d_X$-Privacy for Text and the Curse of Dimensionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely used method to ensure privacy of unstructured text data is the multidimensional Laplace mechanism for $d_X$-privacy, which is a relaxation of differential privacy for metric spaces. We identify an intriguing peculiarity of this mechanism. When applied on a word-by-word basis, the mechanism either outputs the original word, or completely dissimilar words, and very rarely outputs semantically similar words. We investigate this observation in detail, and tie it to the fact that the distance of the nearest neighbor of a word in any word embedding model (which are high-dimensional) is much larger than the relative difference in distances to any of its two consecutive neighbors. We also show that the dot product of the multidimensional Laplace noise vector with any word embedding plays a crucial role in designating the nearest neighbor. We derive the distribution, moments and tail bounds of this dot product. We further propose a fix as a post-processing step, which satisfactorily removes the above-mentioned issue.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Homomorphic Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) aims to train a global model for multiple clients while maintaining their data privacy. However, current PPFL protocols exhibit one or more of the following insufficiencies: considerable degradation in accuracy, the requirement for sharing keys, and cooperation during the key generation or decryption processes. As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%). Compared to traditional MK-HE schemes, HANs increase encryption aggregation speed by 6,075 times while incurring a 29.2 times increase in communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Six Million (Suspected) Fake Stars in GitHub: A Growing Spiral of Popularity Contests, Spams, and Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GitHub, the de facto platform for open-source software development, provides a set of social-media-like features to signal high-quality repositories. Among them, the star count is the most widely used popularity signal, but it is also at risk of being artificially inflated (i.e., faked), decreasing its value as a decision-making signal and posing a security risk to all GitHub users. In this paper, we present a systematic, global, and longitudinal measurement study of fake stars in GitHub. To this end, we build StarScout, a scalable tool able to detect anomalous starring behaviors across all GitHub metadata between 2019 and 2024. Analyzing the data collected using StarScout, we find that: (1) fake-star-related activities have rapidly surged in 2024; (2) the accounts and repositories in fake star campaigns have highly trivial activity patterns; (3) the majority of fake stars are used to promote short-lived phishing malware repositories; the remaining ones are mostly used to promote AI/LLM, blockchain, tool/application, and tutorial/demo repositories; (4) while repositories may have acquired fake stars for growth hacking, fake stars only have a promotion effect in the short term (i.e., less than two months) and become a liability in the long term. Our study has implications for platform moderators, open-source practitioners, and supply chain security researchers.</description>

      <title>Chronus: Understanding and Securing the Cutting-Edge Industry Solutions to DRAM Read Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We 1) present the first rigorous security, performance, energy, and cost analyses of the state-of-the-art on-DRAM-die read disturbance mitigation method, Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) and 2) propose Chronus, a new mechanism that addresses PRAC's two major weaknesses. Our analysis shows that PRAC's system performance overhead on benign applications is non-negligible for modern DRAM chips and prohibitively large for future DRAM chips that are more vulnerable to read disturbance. We identify two weaknesses of PRAC that cause these overheads. First, PRAC increases critical DRAM access latency parameters due to the additional time required to increment activation counters. Second, PRAC performs a constant number of preventive refreshes at a time, making it vulnerable to an adversarial access pattern, known as the wave attack, and consequently requiring it to be configured for significantly smaller activation thresholds. To address PRAC's two weaknesses, we propose a new on-DRAM-die RowHammer mitigation mechanism, Chronus. Chronus 1) updates row activation counters concurrently while serving accesses by separating counters from the data and 2) prevents the wave attack by dynamically controlling the number of preventive refreshes performed. Our performance analysis shows that Chronus's system performance overhead is near-zero for modern DRAM chips and very low for future DRAM chips. Chronus outperforms three variants of PRAC and three other state-of-the-art read disturbance solutions. We discuss Chronus's and PRAC's implications for future systems and foreshadow future research directions. To aid future research, we open-source our Chronus implementation at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Chronus.</description>

      <title>Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, but its robustness is threatened by Byzantine behaviors such as data and model poisoning. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: robust aggregation rules incur error lower bounds that grow with client heterogeneity, while detection-based methods often rely on heuristics (e.g., a fixed number of malicious clients) or require trusted external datasets for validation. We present a defense framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) at the server to synthesize representative data for validating client updates. This approach eliminates reliance on external datasets, adapts to diverse attack strategies, and integrates seamlessly into standard FL workflows. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework accurately distinguishes malicious from benign clients while maintaining overall model accuracy. Beyond Byzantine robustness, we also examine the representativeness of synthesized data, computational costs of cGAN training, and the transparency and scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Are Users More Willing to Use Formally Verified Password Managers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal verification has recently been increasingly used to prove the correctness and security of many applications. It is attractive because it can prove the absence of errors with the same certainty as mathematicians proving theorems. However, while most security experts recognize the value of formal verification, the views of non-technical users on this topic are unknown. To address this issue, we designed and implemented two experiments to understand how formal verification impacts users. Our approach started with a formative study involving 15 participants, followed by the main quantitative study with 200 individuals. We focus on the application domain of password managers since it has been documented that the lack of trust in password managers might lead to lower adoption. Moreover, recent efforts have focused on formally verifying (parts of) password managers. We conclude that formal verification is seen as desirable by users and identify three actional recommendations to improve formal verification communication efforts.</description>

      <title>Insecurity Through Obscurity: Veiled Vulnerabilities in Closed-Source Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most blockchains cannot hide the binary code of programs (i.e., smart contracts) running on them. To conceal proprietary business logic and to potentially deter attacks, many smart contracts are closed-source and employ layers of obfuscation. However, we demonstrate that such obfuscation can obscure critical vulnerabilities rather than enhance security, a phenomenon we term insecurity through obscurity. To systematically analyze these risks on a large scale, we present SKANF, a novel EVM bytecode analysis tool tailored for closed-source and obfuscated contracts. SKANF combines control-flow deobfuscation, symbolic execution, and concolic execution based on historical transactions to identify and exploit asset management vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on real-world Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots reveals that SKANF detects vulnerabilities in 1,030 contracts and successfully generates exploits for 394 of them, with potential losses of \$10.6M. Additionally, we uncover 104 real-world MEV bot attacks that collectively resulted in \$2.76M in losses.</description>

      <title>Cascading and Proxy Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems, enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies, and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Literature Review of the Effect of Quantum Computing on Cryptocurrencies using Blockchain Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain technology face mounting cryptographic vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review evaluating how quantum algorithms, specifically Shors and Grovers, could disrupt the foundational security mechanisms of cryptocurrencies. Shors algorithm poses a threat to public-key cryptographic schemes by enabling efficient factorization and discrete logarithm solving, thereby endangering digital signature systems. Grovers algorithm undermines hash-based functions, increasing the feasibility of fifty one percent attacks and hash collisions. By examining the internal mechanisms of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash, this review identifies specific vulnerabilities in transaction and consensus processes. It further analyses the current hardware limitations of quantum systems and estimates when such attacks could become feasible. In anticipation, it investigates countermeasures including Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and protocol-level modifications such as memory-intensive proof-of-work algorithms and multi-signature schemes. The discussion integrates recent advancements in quantum error correction, hardware scalability, and NIST-standardized cryptographic algorithms. This review concludes that while quantum computers are not yet advanced enough to pose an immediate threat, proactive integration of quantum-resistant solutions is essential. The findings underscore the urgent need for cryptocurrencies to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards to preserve the decentralized trust, integrity, and security that define blockchain-based digital cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Recommendation Filtering-based Trust Model for Securing Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust computation is crucial for ensuring the security of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations that impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure reliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window lengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the effect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score based on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service provider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to filter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In this paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The proposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee accurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score and time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an efficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude recommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of the proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks. The proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting bad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately 44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its effectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in scenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.</description>

      <title>FlowMalTrans: Unsupervised Binary Code Translation for Malware Detection Using Flow-Adapter Architecture</title>

Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reality, Real Problems: A Longitudinal Security Analysis of VR Firmware</title>

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly growing in recent years. VR devices such as Meta Quest 3 utilize numerous sensors to collect users' data to provide an immersive experience. Due to the extensive data collection and the immersive nature, the security of VR devices is paramount. Leading VR devices often adopt and customize Android systems, which makes them susceptible to both Android-based vulnerabilities and new issues introduced by VR-specific customizations (e.g., system services to support continuous head and hand tracking). While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of the Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of VR firmware. We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two major vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the kernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer. We have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including missing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening, inconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve security and trust for VR devices. This paper will act as an important security resource for VR developers, users, and vendors, and will also direct future advancements in secure VR ecosystem.</description>

      <title>VulSolver: Vulnerability Detection via LLM-Driven Constraint Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely heavily on predefined rule matching, which often fails to capture vulnerabilities accurately. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their ability to understand code semantics has emerged as a promising direction for achieving more accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges: instability in model outputs, limitations in context length, and hallucination. As a result, many existing solutions either use LLMs merely to enrich predefined rule sets, thereby keeping the detection process fundamentally rule-based, or over-rely on them, leading to poor robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a constraint-solving approach powered by LLMs named VULSOLVER. By modeling vulnerability detection as a constraint-solving problem, and by integrating static application security testing (SAST) with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our method enables the LLM to act like a professional human security expert. We assess VULSOLVER on the OWASP Benchmark (1,023 labeled samples), achieving 96.29% accuracy, 96.55% F1-score, and 100% recall. Applied to popular GitHub repositories, VULSOLVER also identified 15 previously unknown high-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5-9.8), demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world security analysis.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Tamper-Evident Logging: A High-Performance, Co-Designed Auditing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing tamper-evident logging systems suffer from high overhead and severe data loss in high-load settings, yet only provide coarse-grained tamper detection. Moreover, installing such systems requires recompiling kernel code. To address these challenges, we present Nitro, a high-performance, tamper-evident audit logging system that supports fine-grained detection of log tampering. Even better, our system avoids kernel recompilation by using the eBPF technology. To formally justify the security of Nitro, we provide a new definitional framework for logging systems, and give a practical cryptographic construction meeting this new goal. Unlike prior work that focus only on the cryptographic processing, we codesign the cryptographic part with the pre- and post-processing of the logs to exploit all system-level optimizations. Our evaluations demonstrate Nitro's superior performance, achieving 10X-25X improvements in high-stress conditions and 2X-10X in real-world scenarios while maintaining near-zero data loss. We also provide an advanced variant, Nitro-R that introduces in-kernel log reduction techniques to reduce runtime overhead even further.</description>

      <title>Odoo-based Subcontract Inter-site Access Control Mechanism for Construction Projects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of Construction 4.0, the industry is embracing a new paradigm of labor elasticity, driven by smart and flexible outsourcing and subcontracting strategies. The increased reliance on specialized subcontractors enables companies to scale labor dynamically based on project demands. This adaptable workforce model presents challenges in managing hierarchical integration and coordinating inter-site collaboration. Our design introduces a subsystem integrated into the Odoo ERP framework, employing a modular architecture to streamline labor management, task tracking, and approval workflows. The system adopts a three-pronged approach to ensure synchronized data exchange between general contractors and subcontractors, while maintaining both security and operational independence. The system features hybrid access control, third-party integration for cross-domain communication, and role-based mapping algorithm across sites. The system supports varying degrees of customization through a unified and consolidated attribute mapping center. This center leverages a tree-like index structure and Lagrange interpolation method to enhance the efficiency of role mapping. Demonstrations highlight practical application in outsourcing, integration, and scalability scenarios, confirming the system's robustness under high user volumes and in offline conditions. Experimental results further show improvements in database performance and workflow adaptability to support a scalable, enterprise-level solution that aligns with the evolving demands of smart construction management.</description>

      <title>On Hyperparameters and Backdoor-Resistance in Horizontal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) is particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks as adversaries can easily manipulate both the training data and processes to execute sophisticated attacks. In this work, we study the impact of training hyperparameters on the effectiveness of backdoor attacks and defenses in HFL. More specifically, we show both analytically and by means of measurements that the choice of hyperparameters by benign clients does not only influence model accuracy but also significantly impacts backdoor attack success. This stands in sharp contrast with the multitude of contributions in the area of HFL security, which often rely on custom ad-hoc hyperparameter choices for benign clients$\unicode{x2013}$leading to more pronounced backdoor attack strength and diminished impact of defenses. Our results indicate that properly tuning benign clients' hyperparameters$\unicode{x2013}$such as learning rate, batch size, and number of local epochs$\unicode{x2013}$can significantly curb the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, regardless of the malicious clients' settings. We support this claim with an extensive robustness evaluation of state-of-the-art attack-defense combinations, showing that carefully chosen hyperparameters yield across-the-board improvements in robustness without sacrificing main task accuracy. For example, we show that the 50%-lifespan of the strong A3FL attack can be reduced by 98.6%, respectively$\unicode{x2013}$all without using any defense and while incurring only a 2.9 percentage points drop in clean task accuracy.</description>

      <title>On Rate-Optimal Partitioning Classification from Observable and from Privatised Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the classical method of partitioning classification and study its convergence rate under relaxed conditions, both for observable (non-privatised) and for privatised data. We consider the problem of classification in a $d$ dimensional Euclidean space. Previous results on the partitioning classifier worked with the strong density assumption, which is restrictive, as we demonstrate through simple examples. Here, we study the problem under much milder assumptions. We presuppose that the distribution of the inputs is a mixture of an absolutely continuous and a discrete distribution, such that the absolutely continuous component is concentrated to a $d_a$ dimensional subspace. In addition to the standard Lipschitz and margin conditions, a novel characteristic of the absolutely continuous component is introduced, by which the exact convergence rate of the classification error probability is computed, both for the binary and for the multi-label cases. Interestingly, this rate of convergence depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the inputs, $d_a$. The privacy constraints mean that the independent identically distributed data cannot be directly observed, and the classifiers are functions of the randomised outcome of a suitable local differential privacy mechanism. In this paper we add Laplace distributed noises to the discontinuations of all possible locations of the feature vector and to its label. Again, tight upper bounds on the rate of convergence of the classification error probability are derived, without the strong density assumption, such that this rate depends on $2d_a$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven? Matching Test Cases and Vulnerabilities With the VUTECO Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are commonly detected via static analysis, penetration testing, and fuzzing. They can also be found by running unit tests - so-called vulnerability-witnessing tests - that stimulate the security-sensitive behavior with crafted inputs. Developing such tests is difficult and time-consuming; thus, automated data-driven approaches could help developers intercept vulnerabilities earlier. However, training and validating such approaches require a lot of data, which is currently scarce. This paper introduces VUTECO, a deep learning-based approach for collecting instances of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories. VUTECO carries out two tasks: (1) the "Finding" task to determine whether a test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the exact vulnerability it is witnessing. VUTECO successfully addresses the Finding task, achieving perfect precision and 0.83 F0.5 score on validated test cases in VUL4J and returning 102 out of 145 (70%) correct security-related test cases from 244 open-source Java projects. Despite showing sufficiently good performance for the Matching task - i.e., 0.86 precision and 0.68 F0.5 score - VUTECO failed to retrieve any valid match in the wild. Nevertheless, we observed that in almost all of the matches, the test case was still security-related despite being matched to the wrong vulnerability. In the end, VUTECO can help find vulnerability-witnessing tests, though the matching with the right vulnerability is yet to be solved; the findings obtained lay the stepping stone for future research on the matter.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider people with smartphones operating without external authorities or global resources other than the network itself. In this setting, high-end applications supporting sovereign democratic digital communities, community banks, and digital cooperatives require consensus executed by community members, which must be reconfigurable to support community dynamics.
  The Constitutional Consensus protocol aims to address this need by introducing constitutional self-governance to consensus: participants dynamically amend the participant set, supermajority threshold, and timeout parameter through the consensus protocol itself. We achieve this by enhancing a DAG-based protocol (like Cordial Miners) with participant-controlled reconfiguration, while also supporting both high- and low-throughput operation (like Morpheus), remaining quiescent when idle. This three-way synthesis uniquely combines: (1) constitutional amendments for self-governance, (2) a cryptographic DAG structure for simplicity, parallelism, and throughput, and (3) both high- and low-throughput operation. The protocol achieves consensus in $3\delta$, maintains O(n) amortized communication complexity during high throughput, and seamlessly transitions between modes. The basic protocol (without constitutional amendments) realizes these features in 25 lines of pseudocode, making it one of the most concise consensus protocols for eventual synchrony.</description>

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years, yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness, generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically, CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Walsh Spectrum of Power Residue S-Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime field with $q \geq 3$, and let $d, m \geq 1$ be integers such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$ and $m \mid (q - 1)$. In this paper we bound the absolute values of the Walsh spectrum of S-Boxes $S (x) = x^d \cdot T \left( x^\frac{q - 1}{m} \right)$, where $T$ is a function with $T (x) \neq 0$ if $x \neq 0$. Such S-Boxes have been proposed for the Zero-Knowledge-friendly hash functions Grendel and Polocolo. In particular, we prove the conjectured correlation of the Polocolo S-Box.</description>

      <title>RecPS: Privacy Risk Scoring for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</description>

      <title>Whisper Smarter, not Harder: Adversarial Attack on Partial Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</description>
