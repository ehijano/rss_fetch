      <title>Study of quantum phase transition and entanglement in coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries under Floquet formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an effective time-independent Hamiltonian of a coupled kicked-top (CKT) system derived using the Van Vleck-based perturbation theory at the high-frequency driving limit under Floquet formalism. The effective Hamiltonian is a non-integrable system due to the presence of nonlinear torsional terms in the individual top and also due to the coupling between two tops. Here, we study classical and quantum versions of this coupled top system for torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases. The former model is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. At the quantum limit, depending on the system parameters, both systems satisfy BDI, or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, which is one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. We study the role of underlying symmetry on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we also investigate the interrelations among quantum phase transitions, entanglement between the tops, and the stability of the underlying classical dynamics for the system with torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>
