      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>

Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Following marginal stability manifolds in quasilinear dynamical reductions of multiscale flows in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional extension of a recently developed formalism for slow-fast quasilinear (QL) systems subject to fast instabilities is derived. Prior work has demonstrated that the emergent dynamics of these systems is characterized by a slow evolution of mean fields coupled to marginally stable, fast fluctuation fields. By exploiting this emergent behavior, an efficient fast-eigenvalue/slow-initial-value solution algorithm can be developed in which the amplitude of the fast fluctuations is slaved to the slowly evolving mean fields to ensure marginal stability (and temporal scale separation) is maintained. For 2D systems that are spatially-extended in one direction, the fluctuation eigenfunctions are labeled by their wavenumbers characterizing spatial variability in that direction, and the marginal mode(s) also must coincide with the fastest-growing mode(s) over all admissible wavenumbers. Here, we introduce two equivalent procedures for deriving an ordinary differential equation governing the slow evolution of the wavenumber of the fastest-growing fluctuation mode that simultaneously must be slaved to the mean dynamics to ensure the mode has zero growth rate. We illustrate the procedure in the context of a 2D model partial differential equation that shares certain attributes with the equations governing strongly stratified shear flows. The slaved evolution follows one or more marginal stability manifolds, which constitute select state-space structures that are not invariant under the full flow dynamics yet capture quasi-coherent states in physical space in a manner analogous to invariant solutions identified in, e.g., transitionally-turbulent shear flows. Accordingly, we propose that marginal stability manifolds are central organizing structures in a dynamical systems description of certain classes of multiscale flows where scale separation justifies a QL approximation of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Dictator Dilemma: The Distortion of Information Flow in Autocratic Regimes and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans have been arguing about the benefits of dictatorial versus democratic regimes for millennia. Despite drastic differences between the dictatorships in the world, one of the key common features is the \emph{Dictator's Dilemma} as defined by Wintrobe [1]: a dictator will never know the true state of affairs in his country and is perpetually presented distorted information, thus having difficulties in making the right governing decisions. The dictator's dilemma is essential to most autocratic regimes and is one of the key features in the literature on the subject. Yet, no quantitative theory of how the distortion of information develops from the initial state has been developed up to date. I present a model of the appearance and evolution of such information distortion, with subsequent degradation of control by the dictator. The model is based on the following fundamental and general premises: a) the dictator governs aiming to follow the desired trajectory of development based only on the information from the advisors; b) the deception from the advisors cannot decrease in time; and c) the deception change depends on the difficulties the country encounters. The model shows effective control in the short term (a few months to a year), followed by instability leading to the country's gradual deterioration of the state over many years. I derive some universal parameters applicable to all dictators and show that advisors' deception increases parallel with the decline of the control. In contrast, the dictator thinks the government is doing a reasonable, but not perfect, job. Finally, I present a match of our model to the historical data of grain production in the Soviet Union in 1928-1940.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>
