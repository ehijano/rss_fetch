      <title>The nature of light in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4631</link>
      <description>arXiv:0710.4631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of two degrees of freedom that govern the movement of light in an expanding universe. The use of the fractal manifold model leads to reciprocal causality between variation of geometry and gravity, which both play a complementary role in the universe architecture. This study unravels new facts about the distribution of matter in the universe, and provides a new interpretation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</description>

      <title>An examination of the hierarchy problem beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the Higgs field is a weak isospin doublet of the SU(2) symmetry, the Standard Model requires any symmetry solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem to be SU(2) invariant, a constraint on the type of the symmetry. However, the hierarchy problem is about the size. The size of SU(2) for the Higgs boson can be calculated by $|$SU$_2(\ell)|=\ell^3-\ell$, having the Higgs mass $M_H=1/\ell_{H}\approx125$ GeV. To find the origin of the relative smallness of the Higgs mass in Planck units, alternatively, we search for the origin of such a large order assuming that it stems from an unknown field theory X beyond the Standard Model. Accordingly, this order, which corresponds to the quantum of the Higgs field, should determine the order of quantum/core of X symmetry, its automorphism group. We calculate $|$Aut(X)$|\approx8.2\times 10^{53}$, close to the order of the Monster sporadic group, $|\mathbb M|\approx 8.1\times 10^{53}$, the automorphism group of the Monster CFT, which we therefore conjecture to be X. To examine this conjecture, we calculate the mass of a scalar boson whose SU(2) order is determined by $|\mathbb M|$, observing a 125.4 GeV boson mass and a 245.7 GeV VEV. The Monster CFT does not have any spin-1 operators and Kac-Moody symmetry. Therefore, based on the CFT/(A)dS correspondences, it only describes pure gravity without the gauge fields. In search of a gauge theory candidate, we promote SU(2) (double cover of SO(3)), to SO($d$), and show that the same $\mathbb M$-symmetric vacuum configuration reaches the Planck mass of quantum gravity precisely at $d=32$ (with 99\% accuracy). Then, the spin-1 boson mass of the eligible gauge candidates, SO(32) and $E_8\times E_8$, is calculated to be 80.9 GeV. Further, several pieces of evidence are provided supporting the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Resolving the paradox of the Dirac equation: phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the results of F. Wilf on the need to take into account the quantum-mechanical correspondence rules in the Dirac equation for an electron, it was shown that the equation obtained by giving physical meaning to $\alpha$-Dirac operators should be considered as a phenomenological equation for a particle of non-zero size - the EM polaron, previously introduced by the author. This allows a solution to be found to the inherent paradox of the Dirac equation, which consists of the equality of the velocity of the moving particles to the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum, which is a priori unobtainable, and to understand the physical essence of spin as the intrinsic mechanical moment of an EM polaron. It is also shown that the Dirac-Wilf equation for a single spatial dimension can be considered a generalization of the Schrodinger equation for relativistic energies.</description>
