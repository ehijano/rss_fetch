      <title>Anisotropic Green Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We live in a world filled with anisotropy, a ubiquitous characteristic of both natural and engineered systems. In this study, we concentrate on space deformation and introduce anisotropic Green coordinates, which provide versatile effects for cage-based and variational deformations in both two and three dimensions. The anisotropic Green coordinates are derived from the anisotropic Laplacian equation $\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}\nabla u)=0$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. This equation belongs to the class of constant-coefficient second-order elliptic equations, exhibiting properties analogous to the Laplacian equation but incorporating the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to characterize anisotropic behavior. Based on this equation, we establish the boundary integral formulation, which is subsequently discretized to derive anisotropic Green coordinates defined on the vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. The deformation satisfies basic properties such as linear reproduction and translation invariance, and has closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. We also offer intuitive geometric interpretations of this method. Furthermore, our approach computes the gradient and Hessian of the deformation coordinates and employs the local-global optimization framework to facilitate variational shape deformation, enabling flexible shape manipulation while achieving as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that anisotropic Green coordinates offer versatile and diverse deformation options, providing artists with enhanced flexibility and introducing a novel perspective on spatial deformation.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Authoring of Agent-Based Narratives through Scene Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a system for procedurally generating agent-based narratives using large language models (LLMs). Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects. The returned string encodes who performed which actions, when, and how. A custom parser interprets this string and triggers coordinated agent behaviors, animations, and interaction modules. The system supports agent-based scenes, dynamic object manipulation, and diverse interaction types. Designed for ease of use and rapid iteration, the system enables the generation of virtual agent activity suitable for prototyping agent narratives. The performance of the developed system was evaluated using four popular lightweight LLMs. Each model's process and response time were measured under multiple complexity scenarios. The collected data were analyzed to compare consistency across the examined scenarios and to highlight the relative efficiency and suitability of each model for procedural agent-based narratives generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs can reliably translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent-based behaviors.</description>

      <title>Generating the Past, Present and Future from a Motion-Blurred Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

      <title>Scaling Point-based Differentiable Rendering for Large-scale Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-based Differentiable Rendering (PBDR) enables high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction, but scaling PBDR to high-resolution and large scenes requires efficient distributed training systems. Existing systems are tightly coupled to a specific PBDR method. And they suffer from severe communication overhead due to poor data locality. In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms. Our implementations achieve high performance and resource efficiency: across six datasets and up to 128 GPUs, it reduces communication by up to 91% and improves training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x.</description>

      <title>LiteGE: Lightweight Geodesic Embedding for Efficient Geodesics Computation and Non-Isometric Shape Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.</description>
