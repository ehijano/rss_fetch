      <title>herakoi: a sonification experiment for astronomical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research is revealing data-sonification as a promising complementary approach to vision, benefiting both data perception and interpretation. We present herakoi, a novel open-source software that uses machine learning to allow real-time image sonification, with a focus on astronomical data. By tracking hand movements via a webcam and mapping them to image coordinates, herakoi translates visual properties into sound, enabling users to "hear" images. Its swift responsiveness allows users to access information in astronomical images with short training, demonstrating high reliability and effectiveness. The software has shown promise in educational and outreach settings, making complex astronomical concepts more engaging and accessible to diverse audiences, including blind and visually impaired individuals. We also discuss future developments, such as the integration of large language and vision models to create a more interactive experience in interpreting astronomical data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Design-Science Connection in a multi-week Engineering Design (ED)-based introductory physics laboratory task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08224</link>

Abstract: Reform documents advocate for innovative pedagogical strategies to enhance student learning. A key innovation is the integration of science and engineering practices through Engineering Design (ED)-based physics laboratory tasks, where students tackle engineering design problems by applying physics principles. While this approach has its benefits, research shows that students do not always effectively apply scientific concepts, but instead rely on trial-and-error approaches, and end up 'gadgeteering' their way to a solution. This leads to what is commonly referred to as the "design-science gap" -- that students do not always consciously apply science concepts while solving a design problem. However, as obvious as the notion of a `gap' may appear, there seems to exist no consensus on the definitions of `design' and `science', further complicating the understanding of this `gap'. This qualitative study addresses the notion of the design-science gap by examining student-groups' discussions and written lab reports from a multi-week ED-based undergraduate introductory physics laboratory task. Building on our earlier studies, we developed and employed a nuanced, multi-layered coding scheme inspired by the Gioia Framework to characterize `design thinking' and `science thinking'. We discuss how student-groups engage in various aspects of design and how they apply concepts physics principles to solve the problem. In the process, we demonstrate the interconnectedness of students' design thinking and science thinking. We advocate for the usage of the term "design-science connection" as opposed to "design-science gap" to deepen both design and scientific thinking. Our findings offer valuable insights for educators in design-based science education.</description>

      <title>Presenting a STEM Ways of Thinking Framework for Engineering Design-based Physics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science and engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing student learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has gained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students approach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies and contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper introduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based Physics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science, mathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an undergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel perspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to foster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based projects. A key takeaway is that this framework serves as a practical tool for educators and researchers to design, implement, and analyze interdisciplinary STEM activities in physics classrooms. We describe the development of WoT4EDP, situate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and provide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare WoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English (2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote interdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP framework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in real-world, ED-based physics projects.</description>
