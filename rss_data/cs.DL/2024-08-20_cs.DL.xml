      <title>An Analysis of the Impact of Gold Open Access Publications in Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been some concern about the impact of predatory publishers on scientific research for some time. Recently, publishers that might previously have been considered `predatory' have established their bona fides, at least to the extent that they are included in citation impact scores such as the field-weighted citation impact (FWCI). These are sometimes called `grey' publishers (MDPI, Frontiers, Hindawi). In this paper, we show that the citation landscape for these grey publications is significantly different from the mainstream landscape and that affording publications in these venues the same status as publications in mainstream journals may significantly distort metrics such as the FWCI.</description>

      <title>Optical Music Recognition in Manuscripts from the Ricordi Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ricordi archive, a prestigious collection of significant musical manuscripts from renowned opera composers such as Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, has been digitized. This process has allowed us to automatically extract samples that represent various musical elements depicted on the manuscripts, including notes, staves, clefs, erasures, and composer's annotations, among others. To distinguish between digitization noise and actual music elements, a subset of these images was meticulously grouped and labeled by multiple individuals into several classes. After assessing the consistency of the annotations, we trained multiple neural network-based classifiers to differentiate between the identified music elements. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of these classifiers, with the ultimate goal of using them for the automatic categorization of the remaining unannotated data set. The dataset, complemented by manual annotations, models, and source code used in these experiments are publicly accessible for replication purposes.</description>
