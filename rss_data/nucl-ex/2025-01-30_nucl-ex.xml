      <title>Relativistic chiral nuclear forces: status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear structure, reactions, and the properties of neutron stars from \textit{ab initio} calculations from the nucleon degrees of freedom has always been a primary goal of nuclear physics, in which the microscopic nuclear force serves as the fundamental input. So far, the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, first proposed by the Nobel laureate Weinberg, has become the \textit{de facto} standard input for nuclear \textit{ab initio} studies. However, compared to their non-relativistic counterparts, relativistic \textit{ab initio} calculations, which describe better nuclear observables, have only begun. The lack of modern relativistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is an important issue restricting their development. In this work, we briefly review the development and status of the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, as well as its limitations. We further present a concise introduction to the relativistic chiral nuclear force, show its description of the scattering phase shifts and observables such as differential cross sections, and demonstrate its unique features. Additionally, we show that the relativistic framework could be naturally extended to the antinucleon-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>Zubarev response approach to polarization phenomena in local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the expansion of Zubarev's density operator, we develop a linear response approach to study various spin physics in a locally equilibrated medium, particularly focusing on various polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we connect familiar correlation functions and diagrammatic methods to the Zubarev formalism, enabling the use of established techniques like the Matsubara/imaginary time formalism to facilitate calculations. For a spin-1/2 particle, we re-derive its vector polarization using this Zubarev response approach, which exactly reproduces with our previous results based on Luttinger's method. For a spin-1 particle, we calculate the vector polarization and find the expected contributions from vorticity, temperature gradients, and shear, which are identical to those for spin-1/2 particles except for a factor of 4/3 as expected. For the tensor polarization and spin alignment of a spin-1 boson, we explicitly prove that the non-dissipative contribution is zero at leading order in gradients, and briefly reiterate our previous findings for the dissipative contribution with further discussions on several concerns. Additionally, we discuss several relevant subtleties and questions, including an alternative derivation for Zubarev response approach, the covariance issues of different spin density matrix definitions, a further explanation of slow and fast modes, the mode selection scheme, etc. We also discuss skeleton expansions, higher-order contributions, and non-perturbative methods, particularly their potential connection to lattice field theory. In summary, this work discusses the foundations and subtleties of Zubarev response approach, with specific examples from spin physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Decay spectroscopy of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>

      <title>Exploring Particle Production and Thermal-Like Behavior through Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <title>Ion manipulation from liquid Xe to vacuum: Ba-tagging for a nEXO upgrade and future $0 \nu \beta \beta$ experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay {($0\nu\beta\beta$)} provides a way to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The upcoming nEXO experiment will search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{136}$Xe with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years at the 90\% confidence level using a liquid xenon (LXe) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with 5 tonnes of Xe enriched to $\sim$90\% in the {$\beta \beta$}-decaying isotope $^{136}$Xe. In parallel, a potential future upgrade to nEXO is being investigated with the aim to further suppress radioactive backgrounds and to confirm $\beta \beta$-decay events. This technique, known as Ba-tagging, comprises extracting and identifying the $\beta \beta$-decay daughter $^{136}$Ba ion. One tagging approach being pursued involves extracting a small volume of LXe in the vicinity of a potential $\beta \beta$-decay using a capillary tube and facilitating a liquid-to-gas phase transition by heating the capillary exit. The Ba ion is then separated from the accompanying Xe gas using a radio-frequency (RF) carpet and RF funnel, conclusively identifying the ion as $^{136}$Ba via laser-fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, an accelerator-driven Ba ion source is being developed to validate and optimize this technique. The motivation for the project, the development of the different aspects, along with the current status and results, are discussed here.</description>
