      <title>Integrable open elliptic Toda chain with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we discuss the classical integrable elliptic Toda chain proposed by I. Krichever. Our goal is to construct an open elliptic Toda chain with boundary terms. This is achieved using the factorized form of the Lax matrix and gauge equivalence with the XYZ chain.</description>

      <title>Compatible pairs of Hamiltonian operators of the first and third orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute general compatibility conditions between a weakly nonlocal
  homogeneous Hamiltonian operator and a third-order homogeneous Hamiltonian
  operator. Such operators determine a bi-Hamiltonian structure for many
  integrable PDEs (Korteweg--De Vries, Camassa--Holm, dispersive water waves,
  Dym, WDVV and others). Remarkably, the full set of conditions is purely
  algebraic and the first-order operator is completely determined by commuting
  systems of conservation laws that are Hamiltonian with respect to a
  third-order operator. We illustrate the above results with several examples,
  some of which, concerning WDVV equations, are new.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'{e} XXXIV asymptotics for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a finite-genus algebro-geometric background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation with a finite genus algebro-geometric background. Long-time asymptotics of the solution are derived in four space-time regions. It comes out that the leading-order term in the expansion is, up to a constant, given by the background solution with a shift of the parameter. The subleading term, however, decays at different rates for different regions. We particularly highlight that in the two transition regions, they are of order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ and the coefficients involve an integral of the Painlev\'e XXXIV transcendent. We establish our results by applying a nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problems.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painlev\'e solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painlev\'e solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painlev\'e transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a \textit{different} symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painlev\'e IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painlev\'e IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda and elliptic Toda chains: classical r-matrix structure and relation to XYZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>
