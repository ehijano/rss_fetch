      <title>The Dissipation Theory of Aging: A Quantitative Analysis Using a Cellular Aging Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level. We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data, incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings, we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with molecular resolution.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Risk of HPAIV Transmission to Danish Cattle via Wild Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) panzootic has severely impacted wild bird populations worldwide, with documented (zoonotic) transmission to mammals, including humans. Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have raised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in other countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool, coordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in wild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the cattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This study aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV) spillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in Denmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is developed by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and Bird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated quantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial distribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark. The highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The estimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48, 4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025. These risk estimates provide valuable insights to support veterinary contingency planning and enable targeted allocation of resources in highrisk areas for the early detection of HPAIV in cattle.</description>

      <title>Negative feedback and oscillations in a model for mRNA translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</description>

      <title>De Novo Generation of Hit-like Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a hybrid neural network, HNN2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed HNN2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</description>
