      <title>Drawing Reeb Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reeb graphs are simple topological descriptors which find applications in many areas like topological data analysis and computational geometry. Despite their prevalence, visualization of Reeb graphs has received less attention. In this paper, we bridge an essential gap in the literature by exploring the complexity of drawing Reeb graphs. Specifically, we demonstrate that Reeb graph crossing number minimization is NP-hard, both for straight-line and curve representations of edges. On the other hand, we identify specific classes of Reeb graphs, namely paths and caterpillars, for which crossing-free drawings exist. We also give an optimal algorithm for drawing cycle-shaped Reeb graphs with the least number of crossings and provide initial observations on the complexities of drawing multi-cycle Reeb graphs. We hope that this work establishes the foundation for an understanding of the graph drawing challenges inherent in Reeb graph visualization and paves the way for future work in this area.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>

      <title>Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Flexible and Probabilistic Topology Tracking with Partial Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a flexible and probabilistic framework for tracking topological features in time-varying scalar fields using merge trees and partial optimal transport. Merge trees are topological descriptors that record the evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar fields. We present a new technique for modeling and comparing merge trees using tools from partial optimal transport. In particular, we model a merge tree as a measure network, that is, a network equipped with a probability distribution, and define a notion of distance on the space of merge trees inspired by partial optimal transport. Such a distance offers a new and flexible perspective for encoding intrinsic and extrinsic information in the comparative measures of merge trees. More importantly, it gives rise to a partial matching between topological features in time-varying data, thus enabling flexible topology tracking for scientific simulations. Furthermore, such partial matching may be interpreted as probabilistic coupling between features at adjacent time steps, which gives rise to probabilistic tracking graphs. We derive a stability result for our distance and provide numerous experiments indicating the efficacy of our framework in extracting meaningful feature tracks.</description>

      <title>Best of two worlds: Cartesian sampling and volume computation for distance-constrained configuration spaces using Cayley coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volume calculation of configurational spaces acts as a vital part in configurational entropy calculation, which contributes towards calculating free energy landscape for molecular systems. In this article, we present our sampling-based volume computation method using distance-based Cayley coordinate, mitigating drawbacks: our method guarantees that the sampling procedure stays in lower-dimensional coordinate space (instead of higher-dimensional Cartesian space) throughout the whole process; and our mapping function, utilizing Cayley parameterization, can be applied in both directions with low computational cost. Our method uniformly samples and computes a discrete volume measure of a Cartesian configuration space of point sets satisfying systems of distance inequality constraints. The systems belong to a large natural class whose feasible configuration spaces are effectively lower dimensional subsets of high dimensional ambient space. Their topological complexity makes discrete volume computation challenging, yet necessary in several application scenarios including free energy calculation in soft matter assembly modeling. The algorithm runs in linear time and empirically sub-linear space in the number of grid hypercubes (used to define the discrete volume measure) \textit{that intersect} the configuration space. In other words, the number of wasted grid cube visits is insignificant compared to prevailing methods typically based on gradient descent. Specifically, the traversal stays within the feasible configuration space by viewing it as a branched covering, using a recent theory of Cayley or distance coordinates to convexify the base space, and by employing a space-efficient, frontier hypercube traversal data structure. A software implementation and comparison with existing methods is provided.</description>
