      <title>Homotopy types of complexes of hyperplanes in quasi-median graphs and applications to right-angled Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that, given two finite connected graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, if the two right-angled Artin groups $A(\Gamma_1)$ and $A(\Gamma_2)$ are quasi-isometric, then the infinite pointed sums $\bigvee_\mathbb{N} \Gamma_1^{\bowtie}$ and $\bigvee_\mathbb{N} \Gamma_2^{\bowtie}$ are homotopy equivalent, where $\Gamma_i^{\bowtie}$ denotes the simplicial complex whose vertex-set is $\Gamma_i$ and whose simplices are given by joins. These invariants are extracted from a study, of independent interest, of the homotopy types of several complexes of hyperplanes in quasi-median graphs (such as one-skeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes). For instance, given a quasi-median graph $X$, the \emph{crossing complex} $\mathrm{Cross}^\triangle(X)$ is the simplicial complex whose vertices are the hyperplanes (or $\theta$-classes) of $X$ and whose simplices are collections of pairwise transverse hyperplanes. When $X$ has no cut-vertex, we show that $\mathrm{Cross}^\triangle(X)$ is homotopy equivalent to the pointed sum of the links of all the vertices in the prism-completion $X^\square$ of $X$.</description>

      <title>Higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores foliated differential graded algebras (dga) and their role in extending fundamental theorems of differential geometry to foliations. We establish an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, demonstrating that the classical quasi-isomorphism between singular cochains and de Rham forms lifts to an $A_{\infty}$ quasi-isomorphism in the foliated setting. Furthermore, we investigate the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, building upon the established higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for manifolds. By constructing an integration functor, we prove a higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, revealing an equivalence between $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids within the context of foliations. This work generalizes the classical Riemann-Hilbert correspondence to foliations, providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between representations of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids in this framework.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>Characterization of differential K-theory by hexagon diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a canonical topology on differential K-theory induced from the Frech\'et space topology on differential forms and the discrete topology on topological K-theory, we prove that differential K-theory is uniquely determined by the character diagram up to a unique natural equivalence, thus giving an affirmative answer to a question asked by Simons and Sullivan in \cite{SS10}. We further deduce rigidity results including that there is a unique way of realizing $\RR/\ZZ$-K-theory as the flat theory, strengthening the results of \cite{BS10}.</description>

      <title>The stratified Grassmannian and its depth-one subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a tangential theory for linked manifolds of depth $1$, i.e., for spans $\mathfrak{S}=(M\overset{\pi}{\twoheadleftarrow} L\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow}N)$ of smooth manifolds where $\pi$ is a fibre bundle and $\iota$ is a closed embedding. The tangent classifier of $\mathfrak{S}$ is given as a topological span map $\mathfrak{S}\to B\mathrm{O}(n,m)$ where $B\mathrm{O}(n,m)=(B\mathrm{O}(n)\twoheadleftarrow B\mathrm{O}(n)\times B\mathrm{O}(m)\hookrightarrow B\mathrm{O}(n+m))$. We show that this recovers and generalises the tangential theory introduced by Ayala, Francis and Rozenblyum for conically smooth stratified spaces by constructing fully faithful functors $\mathbf{EX}(B\mathrm{O}(n,m))\hookrightarrow\mathbf{V}^{\hookrightarrow}$ of quasi-categories, where $\mathbf{EX}$ takes the exit path quasi-category of the span, and $\mathbf{V}^{\hookrightarrow}$ is a quasi-category model of the infinite stratified Grassmannian of AFR. This result has analogues for other classical structure groups and for Stiefel manifolds. As an application, we reduce the classification of conically smooth bundles in depth $1$ to the classification of ordinary bundles on linked manifolds.</description>

      <title>Linked spaces and exit paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce explicit exit path $\infty$-categories (EPCs) for linked spaces, i.e., spans $M\xleftarrow{\pi} L\xrightarrow{\iota}N$ of spaces where $\pi$ is a fibration and $\iota$ is a cofibration, and prove that this induces a fully faithful functor from an $\infty$-category of linked spaces to the $\infty$-category of all $\infty$-categories whose essential image includes the EPCs of conically smooth stratified spaces (CSSs) of depth $1$, reducing the stratified topology of depth-$1$ CSSs to the ordinary topology of linked spaces. Finally, using linked smooth manifolds we resolve various versions of a conjecture of Ayala-Francis-Rozenblyum in the negative by exhibiting $\infty$-categories with conservative functors to $\{0&lt;1\}$ satisfying certain finiteness conditions but which are not equivalent to EPCs of CSSs.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing decomposition of multiparameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While decomposition of one-parameter persistence modules behaves nicely, as demonstrated by the algebraic stability theorem, decomposition of multiparameter modules is known to be unstable in a certain precise sense. Until now, it has not been clear that there is any way to get around this and build a meaningful stability theory for multiparameter module decomposition. We introduce new tools, in particular $\epsilon$-refinements and $\epsilon$-erosion neighborhoods, to start building such a theory. We then define the $\epsilon$-pruning of a module, which is a new invariant acting like a ``refined barcode'' that shows great promise to extract features from a module by approximately decomposing it.
  Our main theorem can be interpreted as a generalization of the algebraic stability theorem to multiparameter modules up to a factor of $2r$, where $r$ is the maximal pointwise dimension of one of the modules. Furthermore, we show that the factor $2r$ is close to optimal. Finally, we discuss the possibility of strengthening the stability theorem for modules that decompose into pointwise low-dimensional summands, and pose a conjecture phrased purely in terms of basic linear algebra and graph theory that seems to capture the difficulty of doing this. We also show that this conjecture is relevant for other areas of multipersistence, like the computational complexity of approximating the interleaving distance, and recent applications of relative homological algebra to multipersistence.</description>
