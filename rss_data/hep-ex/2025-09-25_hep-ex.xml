      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.</description>

      <title>The Pareto Frontier of Resilient Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.</description>

      <title>Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis with Spontaneous $CP$ Violation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) are among the most compelling indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Studies on Response Uniformity of RPC and Exploring Oscillation Dip and Valley, Non-Standard Interactions, and Earth's Core using Atmospheric Neutrinos at ICAL-INO detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth's core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.</description>

      <title>Configuration and Benchmarking of $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ Processes with K4GeneratorsConfig</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of electron-positron colliders will require unprecedented precision in both theory and experiment. Sophisticated software frameworks are essential to evaluate detector concepts, optimize designs, and simulating physical processes. In this context, Monte Carlo (MC) event generators play a central role, enabling realistic simulations of Standard Model processes and providing the basis for physics studies. However, technical consistency across different generators remains critical, particularly in domains where agreement is expected. To address this need, we present K4GeneratorsConfig, a Python-based package that automates the benchmarking process for MC generators. The tool translates universal physics inputs into generator-specific configurations, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and reduced human error. Its modular design allows for straightforward integration of additional generators, supports batch processing, and provides compatibility with the Key4hep software stack</description>

      <title>Studies of beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV within a transport model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy proton proton ($pp$) collisions at the LHC, non-prompt charm hadrons, originating from beauty hadron decays, provide a valuable probe for beauty quark dynamics, particularly at low transverse momentum where direct beauty measurements are challenging. We employ A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT) of string melting version coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions to study the beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this work, the beauty quark mass during the generation stage has been increased to reproduce the measured $b\bar{b}$ cross section, and a beauty flavor specific coalescence parameter $r_{BM}^b$ is introduced to match LHCb measurements of beauty baryon to meson ratios. With these refinements, AMPT achieves a reasonable agreement with experimental data on beauty hadron yields and non-prompt charm hadron production from ALICE and LHCb. We present the transverse momentum and multiplicity dependence of non-prompt to prompt charm hadron ratios, providing new insights into the interplay between beauty quark production and hadronization process. We emphasize that the multiplicity dependence of the non-prompt to prompt charm hadron productions can be useful to constrain the flavor dependences of the coalescence dynamics. This work establishes a unified framework for future studies of heavy quark transport and collective flow behavior in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Beyond the Standard Model Scenarios in Long-baseline and Astrophysical Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation model into the NEUT event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of a model for charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering in the NEUT Monte Carlo event generator. This model employs relativistic momentum distributions obtained from mean field theory and relativistic distorted waves to describe the initial and final nucleon states. Final state interactions, both elastic and inelastic, are modelled by combining distorted waves with the NEUT intranuclear cascade, offering a more accurate representation of the interactions experienced by scattered nucleons. The model and its implementation in NEUT are described in detail and benchmarked against $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{12}$C scattering cross-section measurements from T2K and MINER$\nu$A, as well as $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{40}$Ar measurements from MicroBooNE. Results, including transverse kinematic imbalance variables and scattered nucleon kinematics, show improved $\chi^2$ values compared to other CCQE models in NEUT. Furthermore, the model consistently predicts lower cross sections in CCQE-dominated regions, indicating potential for further refinement, such as incorporating two-body currents or the use of more advanced nucleon axial form factors consistent with lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Hybrid Particle Detectors to the Energy Spectra of Air Shower Components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the energy spectrum of air shower components crucial for understanding primary cosmic rays and the physical processes governing their interactions in the atmosphere. However, accurately measuring the energy of shower particles reaching the ground is challenging due to the inherent simplicity of typical cosmic ray experiments.
  This study takes advantage of a hybrid detector station and introduces an analysis for assessing the energy spectra of air shower components. The station is composed of a scintillator surface detector (SSD), a water-Cherenkov detector (WCD), and resistive plate chambers (RPCs). Our results demonstrate that the combination of data from these detectors enables precise assessment of the energy spectrum of electromagnetic particles and low-energy muons, independent of potential detector ageing effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is performed for dark matter particles produced in association with a resonant pair of Higgs bosons using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This signature is expected in some extensions of the Standard Model predicting the production of dark matter particles, and is interpreted in terms of a dark Higgs model containing a $Z'$ mediator in which the dark Higgs boson $s$ decays into a pair of Higgs bosons. The dark Higgs boson is reconstructed through final states with at least three $b$-tagged jets, produced by the pair of Higgs boson decays, in events with significant missing transverse momentum consistent with the presence of dark matter. The observed data are found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions, constraining scenarios with dark Higgs boson masses within the range of 250 to 400 GeV and $Z'$ mediators up to 2.3 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02867v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FAIR Universe HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focused on measuring the physical properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators. Participants were required to compute and report confidence intervals for a parameter of interest regarding the Higgs boson while accounting for various systematic (epistemic) uncertainties. The dataset is a tabular dataset of 28 features and 280 million instances. Each instance represents a simulated proton-proton collision as observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. The features of these simulations were chosen to capture key characteristics of different types of particles. These include primary attributes, such as the energy and three-dimensional momentum of the particles, as well as derived attributes, which are calculated from the primary ones using domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, a label feature designates each instance's type of proton-proton collision, distinguishing the Higgs boson events of interest from three background sources. As outlined in this paper, the permanent release of the dataset allows long-term benchmarking of new techniques. The leading submissions, including Contrastive Normalising Flows and Density Ratios estimation through classification, are described. Our challenge has brought together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic uncertainties within AI techniques.</description>

      <title>Doubly charmed hexaquarks in the diquark picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate doubly charmed hexaquark states within the diquark picture, by employing the constituent quark model and the quark-interchange model as our theoretical frameworks. Using the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically study these states, with calculating various properties such as mass spectra, internal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii, and two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no stable state in this system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest that the doubly charmed hexaquark states exhibit a compact configuration. By examining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable states and their primary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase space, we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the structures and interactions of doubly charmed hexaquark states and offers valuable insights for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory: An innovative framework for eliminating renormalization ambiguities in QCD and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), an innovative framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion through Effective Dynamical Renormalization (EDR) with Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM) constraints. This approach yields completely scale and scheme invariant observables whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to the experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD and QED, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with scheme-independent equations, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$ through EDR implementation. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05262 \pm 0.0005$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring calculation that are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approaches. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76)$), differing from the experiment by only $-1.2(81) \times 10^{-13}$ representing an excellent 0.15$\sigma$ agreement. The framework enables the self-consistent extraction of the natural electromagnetic coupling $\alpha_{\text{eff}}^{-1}(m_e) = 137.036005301$ at the electron mass scale.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Uncertainties on Neural Density Ratios with wifi Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce wifi ensembles as a novel framework to obtain asymptotic frequentist uncertainties on density ratios, with a particular focus on neural ratio estimation in the context of high-energy physics. When the density ratio of interest is a likelihood ratio conditioned on parameters, wifi ensembles can be used to perform simulation-based inference on those parameters. After training the basis functions f_i(x), uncertainties on the weights w_i can be straightforwardly propagated to the estimated parameters without requiring extraneous bootstraps. To demonstrate this approach, we present an application in quantum chromodynamics at the Large Hadron Collider, using wifi ensembles to estimate the likelihood ratio between generated quark and gluon jets. We use this learned likelihood ratio to estimate the quark fraction in a synthetic mixed quark/gluon sample, showing that the resultant uncertainties empirically satisfy the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <title>Search for the chiral magnetic effect through beam energy dependence of charge separation using event shape selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy, heavy-ion collisions can create local domains of chirality-imbalanced quarks, reflecting the topological features of quantum chromodynamics. The chiral magnetic effect (CME) predicts an electric charge separation of quarks in such topological domains along the magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) generated by the passing of two high-$Z$ nuclei. We use a correlation observable $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ between charged meson pairs to detect the CME-induced charge separation and a novel event shape selection (ESS) method to mitigate the background effects related to elliptic flow ($v_2$). The ESS method classifies events based on the emission pattern of final-state particles and determines $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ from the zero-flow limit. We reconstruct the $\vec{B}$ field direction from the spectator nucleons, which minimizes backgrounds unrelated to the collective motion of the system. In this work, we report the measurements of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ and a background indicator $\Delta\gamma^{132}$ in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase II and at the top RHIC energy. After background suppression, $\Delta\gamma^{132}_{\rm ESS}$ aligns with zero, and $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ is reduced to no more than 20\% of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$. We observe a finite residual charge separation with $2.6\sigma$, $3.1\sigma$, and $3.3\sigma$ significance in the 20\%--50\% centrality range of Au+Au collisions at 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV. The results at 17.3 and 27 GeV also show positive values but with a lower significance of $1.3\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$, respectively. The corresponding $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ values at 7.7, 9.2, and 200 GeV are consistent with zero within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A Simple Apparatus for Testing PMT Humidity Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a low-cost apparatus to extend a photomultiplier tube (PMT) testing setup to operations at high humidity and/or at an elevated temperature. This setup allows a determination of whether a PMT can successfully operate for an extended period of time in a high-humidity environment, such as the waterline of a water Cherenkov detector.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show using the Hamiltonian formalism that if parity is a good symmetry of QCD, then the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta}$ must be $0$ or $\pi$. We find that for $P$ to be a physical symmetry, it must leave the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum invariant ($P: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$), which is possible only for $\theta = 0$ or $\pi$. We also show that forming linear combinations of states from different $\theta$-sectors produces only classical statistical mixtures, consistent with superselection rules, confirming that $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ is the most general Hilbert space for the quantum theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that requiring $[P,\Omega]=0$, where $\Omega$ is the generator of large gauge transformations, independently enforces $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$), and that for complex quark mass matrix $M$, if a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$ is a symmetry, then the value of $\theta$ gets determined so that it exactly cancels $Arg Det M$, again giving $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$). These results establish the equivalence of the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches to the strong CP problem.</description>
