      <title>Modeling and Simulating Agent-Based City Migration Using Conway's Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become a cornerstone of complexity science, enabling the study of heterogeneous agents interacting within dynamic environments. Among ABM frameworks, John Conway's Game of Life (GoL) stands out for its simplicity and ability to generate emergent macroscopic patterns from basic microscopic rules. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel GoL-based framework to simulate urban migration dynamics. Using a grid-within-a-grid approach, our approach encodes probabilistic tendencies for out-migration due to densification and sparsification, simulating the evolution of population centers. By initializing GoL grids with different distributions and parameterizing migration preferences, we explore how urban structures emerge and stabilize over time. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that even with simple rules, this framework shows promise for understanding emergent urban phenomena, providing insights into city growth and structure. Methodologically, our framework offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying urban migration patterns, contributing to the broader application of ABMs in computational urban social science.</description>

      <title>The Shortest Interesting Binary Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will show that there exist two binary words (one of length 4 and one of length 6) that play a special role in many different problems in combinatorics on words. They can therefore be considered \textit{the shortest interesting binary words}. My claim is supported by the fact that these two words appear in dozens of papers in combinatorics on words.</description>

      <title>Optimal L-Systems for Stochastic L-system Inference Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two novel theorems that address two open problems in stochastic Lindenmayer-system (L-system) inference, specifically focusing on the construction of an optimal stochastic L-system capable of generating a given sequence of strings. The first theorem delineates a method for crafting a stochastic L-system that has the maximum probability of a derivation producing a given sequence of words through a single derivation (noting that multiple derivations may generate the same sequence). Furthermore, the second theorem determines the stochastic L-systems with the highest probability of producing a given sequence of words with multiple possible derivations. From these, we introduce an algorithm to infer an optimal stochastic L-system from a given sequence. This algorithm incorporates advanced optimization techniques, such as interior point methods, to ensure the creation of a stochastic L-system that maximizes the probability of generating the given sequence (allowing for multiple derivations). This allows for the use of stochastic L-systems as a model for machine learning using only positive data for training.</description>

      <title>The Decision Problem for Regular First-Order Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Entscheidungsproblem}, or the classical decision problem, asks whether a given formula of first-order logic is satisfiable. In this work, we consider an extension of this problem to regular first-order \emph{theories}, i.e., (infinite) regular sets of formulae. Building on the elegant classification of syntactic classes as decidable or undecidable for the classical decision problem, we show that some classes (specifically, the EPR and Gurevich classes), which are decidable in the classical setting, become undecidable for regular theories. On the other hand, for each of these classes, we identify a subclass that remains decidable in our setting, leaving a complete classification as a challenge for future work. Finally, we observe that our problem generalises prior work on automata-theoretic verification of uninterpreted programs and propose a semantic class of existential formulae for which the problem is decidable.</description>
