      <title>Rethinking how randomness is taught in K-12 statistics subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective teaching and learning of statistics persist as a challenge in K-12 education and has clear impacts in developing competence and confidence of students in entering STEM fields especially in today's digital age of data science. In this paper, it is proposed that the current pedagogy around teaching the concept of randomness, a core element of statistics, is incomplete. It is argued that expanding on the observer-relative nature of randomness will address commonly existing ambiguities on what is and what is not random, help in explaining more complex statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, and impart greater awareness on the practical value of the practice of statistics in data science.</description>

      <title>Graph Colouring: A Visual Tour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph colouring is a combinatorial optimisation problem with applications in several important domains, including sports scheduling, cartography, street map navigation, and timetabling. It is also of significant theoretical interest and a standard subject in university-level courses on graph theory, algorithms, and combinatorics. In this paper, we consider the topics of node, edge, and face colouring along with their associated algorithms. Theoretical results are reviewed and brought to life through a collection of detailed, visually engaging figures designed to enhance understanding and appeal.</description>
