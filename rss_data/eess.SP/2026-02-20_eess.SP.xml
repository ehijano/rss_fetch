      <title>A New Perspective on Scale: A Novel Transform for NMR Envelope Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envelope extraction in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental step for processing the data space generated by this technique. Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals.</description>

      <title>Odor Communication with Green Leaf Volatiles for Stress Signalling in the Internet of Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an end-to-end odor communication model for stress signaling between plants using Green Leaf Volatiles (GLV). A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $\beta$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region. These findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of plant-plant communication and for developing next-generation precision farming technologies.</description>

      <title>BrainRVQ: A High-Fidelity EEG Foundation Model via Dual-Domain Residual Quantization and Hierarchical Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

      <title>Covert Routing with DSSS Signaling Against Cycle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates covert multi-hop communication in wireless networks where an adversary employs a cyclostationary (cycle) detector to reveal hidden transmissions. The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part I: Traffic-Aware Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part II: Geometry-Aware Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters.</description>

      <title>Assessing Ionospheric Scintillation Risk for Direct-to-Cellular Communications using Frequency-Scaled GNSS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key issues facing Direct-to-Cellular (D2C) satellite communication systems is ionospheric scintillation on the uplink and downlink, which can significantly degrade link quality. This work investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of amplitude scintillation at D2C frequencies by scaling L-band scintillation observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to bands relevant to D2C operation, including the low-band, and 3GPP's N255 and N256. These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Secure Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Design for Multi-Layer Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote and resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments often lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, motivating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with onboard multiaccess edge computing (MEC) capabilities. Nevertheless, in the presence of malicious actors, authentication needs to be performed to avoid non-authorized nodes from draining the computing resources of the NTN nodes. As a solution, we propose a four-layer MEC-enabled NTN with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as access nodes, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as coordinator and authenticator, and a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) acting as remote MEC servers. We consider a tag-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme to authenticate legitimate users, and formulate a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation for the admitted tasks, which is solved via block coordinate descent. Numerical results show that the PLA scheme is efficient and performs better than the benchmark schemes. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints.</description>

      <title>A Novel Near-Field Dictionary Design for Hybrid MIMO with Uniform Planar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field ultra-massive MIMO (U-MIMO) systems provide enhanced spatial resolution but present challenges for channel estimation, particularly when hybrid architectures are employed. Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Failure Detection for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signal processing-based framework is proposed for detecting random segment failures in segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna systems. To decouple the passively combined uplink signal and to provide per-segment observability, tagged pilots are employed. A simple tag is attached to each segment and is used to apply a known low-rate modulation at the segment feed, which assigns a unique signature to each segment. Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Rate Maximization in RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems Using a Practical Hardware Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for secure wireless communication, in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) sends confidential messages to a multi-antenna receiver (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values.</description>

      <title>Analytical Derivation of Quantization Error in Threshold Level Quantizers Using Bipolar PFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform quantization is a topic that has been extensively studied. However and although an analytical description of quantization noise has been proposed, most descriptions of the spectral properties of quantization error resort to statistical descriptions. In this paper, we show how the spectrum of a quantized signal can be expressed using pulse frequency modulation. We first establish the equivalence of a uniform quantizer with a system based on the bipolar pulse frequency modulation and we define afterwards the Fourier transform of the quantized signal using pulse frequency modulation properties. This model brings a more intuitive understanding of the spectral structure of quantization noise and complements prior research in the topic. The results of the paper can be directly applied to level crossing ADCs with zero-order-hold interpolators, giving an accurate estimation of their performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Implicit Representations for 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.</description>

      <title>Device-Centric ISAC for Exposure Control via Opportunistic Virtual Aperture Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory limits on Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) require handheld devices to reduce transmit power when operated near the user's body. Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers.

Abstract: In today's world, modern infrastructures are being equipped with information and communication technologies to create large IoT networks.
  It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations.
  This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides competitive results compared to the state of the art while being computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17640v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Contact-Anchored Proprioceptive Odometry for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-based End-to-End Learning for Multi-User MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) learning has recently been proposed to jointly design the modulator and symbol detector by using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, existing schemes lack sufficient capability to cancel multi-user interference (MUI) in uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based E2E learning scheme that employs a GNN-based modulator to generate learned constellation points, and a GNN-based detector to cancel MUI. They are jointly optimized to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed E2E outperforms existing schemes with a predefined modulator. Specifically, it achieves an approximate 2 dB gain in a high MUI environment and surpasses even the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector in a low MUI condition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Sparse Bayesian Learning Methods with Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Hardware Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for realizing the performance gains of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditional approaches to channel estimation typically assume ideal receiver hardware and linear signal models. However, practical receivers suffer from impairments such as nonlinearities in the low-noise amplifiers and quantization errors, which invalidate standard model assumptions and degrade the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a nonlinear channel estimation framework that models the distortion function arising from hardware impairments using Gaussian process (GP) regression while leveraging the inherent sparsity of massive MIMO channels. First, we form a GP-based surrogate of the distortion function, employing pseudo-inputs to reduce the computational complexity. Then, we integrate the GP-based surrogate of the distortion function into newly developed enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methods, enabling distortion-aware sparse channel estimation. Specifically, we propose two nonlinear SBL methods based on distinct optimization objectives, each offering a different trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate significant gains over the Bussgang linear minimum mean squared error estimator and linear SBL, particularly under strong distortion and at high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Enhanced by Feature Reconstruction for Semantic Communication Module Updates of Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in semantic communication have primarily focused on image transmission, where neural network-based joint source-channel coding modules play a central role. However, such systems often experience semantic communication errors due to mismatched knowledge bases between agents and performance degradation from outdated models, necessitating regular model updates. To address these challenges in vector quantization (VQ)-based image semantic communication systems, we propose FedSFR, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates semantic feature reconstruction (FR). FedSFR introduces an FR step at the parameter server and allows a subset of clients to transmit compact feature vectors in lieu of sending full local model updates, thereby improving training stability and communication efficiency. To enable effective FR learning, we design a loss function tailored for VQ-based image semantic communication and demonstrate its validity as a surrogate for image reconstruction error. We further establish a rigorous convergence analysis of FedSFR. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of FedSFR over existing baselines, especially in capacity-constrained settings, confirming both its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Wireless Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.</description>

      <title>AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.</description>

      <title>Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals</title>

Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Th\'{e}orie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00292v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable MCP algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We prove a novel conformal Neyman-Pearson lemma, motivating practical classifier-based choices for our conformal score function. Finally, we exemplify the MCP algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images, text, and accelerometer data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable audio capture.</description>
