      <title>Nonresonance for problems involving $(p,q)$-Laplacian equations with nonlinear perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solvability of $(p,q)$-Laplacian problems with nonlinear reaction terms and non-homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. First, we provide a complete description of the spectrum of the eigenvalue problem involving the $(p,q)$-Laplacian with weights and a spectral parameter present in both the differential equation and on the boundary. Then, using variational methods and critical point theory, we prove the existence of weak solutions for the nonlinear problem when the nonlinearities involved remain asymptotically, in some sense, below the first eigenvalue of the $q$-Laplacian problem with weights and a spectral parameter present in both the differential equation and on the boundary. We also establish an existence result for the nonlinear problem when the nonlinearities involved remain asymptotically below the first Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue-line, which is a line connecting the first Steklov and first Neumann eigenvalues for $q$-Laplacian problems with weights and a spectral parameter present either in the differential equation or on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Global in-time rough large data solution to complex-valued semilinear damped evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semilinear Cauchy problem for complex-valued damped evolution equations \begin{align*}
  \partial_t^2u+(-\Delta)^{\sigma}u+(-\Delta)^{\delta}\partial_tu=u^p,\ \ u(0,x)=u_0(x),\ \partial_tu(0,x)=u_1(x), \end{align*} with $\delta\in[0,\sigma]$, $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}_+$ and $p\in\mathbb{N}_+\backslash\{1\}$, where the initial data belong to the rough space $E^{\alpha}_s$ endowed with the norm \begin{align*}
  \|f\|_{E^{\alpha}_s}=\big\|\langle\xi\rangle^s\,2^{\alpha|\xi|}\widehat{f}(\xi)\big\|_{L^2}\ \ \mbox{with}\ \ \alpha&lt;0, \ s\in\mathbb{R}. \end{align*} Concerning $(u_0,u_1)\in E^{\alpha}_{s+\bar{\kappa}}\times E^{\alpha}_s$ when $s\geqslant\frac{n}{2}-\frac{2\kappa+\bar{\kappa}-2\delta}{p-1}-\bar{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=\min\{2\delta,\sigma\}$ and $\bar{\kappa}=\max\{2\delta,\sigma\}$ whose Fourier transforms are supported in a suitable subset of first octant, we prove a global in-time existence result without requiring the smallness of rough initial data.</description>

      <title>Global in-time existence of solutions for the complex-valued Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equations of Westervelt-type under different conditions on initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the global in-time existence of solutions for the complex-valued Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson (JMGT) equations of Westervelt-type, namely, \begin{align*} \tau\partial_t^3\psi+\partial_t^2\psi+\mathcal{A}\psi+(\delta+\tau)\mathcal{A}\partial_t\psi=(1+\tfrac{B}{2A})\partial_t[(\partial_t\psi)^2] \end{align*} in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\tau,\delta,\frac{B}{A}\in\mathbb{R}_+$ and the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{A}:=(-\Delta)^{\sigma}$ equipping $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}_+$. Our aims are twofold. For one thing, by considering the rough initial data with their Fourier support restrictions in a suitable subset of first octant, we demonstrate a global in-time existence result without requiring the smallness of initial data. For another, by removing these Fourier support restrictions, we prove another global in-time existence result for the equivalent strongly coupled JMGT systems, where the real and imaginary parts of initial data, respectively, belong to regular Sobolev spaces with different additional Lebesgue integrabilities.</description>

      <title>Global small data weak solutions of 2-D semilinear wave equations with scale-invariant damping, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $2$-D semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping $\square u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $t\geq 1$, $\mu&gt;0$ and $p&gt;1$, it is conjectured that the global small data weak solution $u$ exists when $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu) =\frac{\mu+3+\sqrt{\mu^2+14\mu+17}}{2(\mu+1)}$ for $0&lt;\mu\le 2$ and $p&gt;p_f(2)=2$ for $\mu\geq 2$. In our previous papers, the global small solution $u$ has been obtained for $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu)$ and $0&lt;\mu&lt;2$ but $\mu\not=1$. In the present paper, by the vector field method together with the delicate analysis on the Bessel functions, we will show the global existence of small solution $u$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\mu\ge 2$. In forthcoming paper, for $\mu=1$ and $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu)=p_{s}(3)=1+\sqrt 2$, the global solution $u$ is also obtained. Therefore, this open question has been solved completely.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Characterizations and Applications of Fractional Sobolev Spaces with Partially Vanishing Traces on $(\epsilon,\delta,D)$-Domains Supporting $D$-Adapted Fractional Hardy Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an $(\epsilon,\delta,D)$-domain, with $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $\delta\in(0,\infty]$, and $D\subset \partial \Omega$ being a closed part of $\partial \Omega$, which is a general open connected set when $D=\partial \Omega$ and an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-domain when $D=\emptyset$. Let $s\in(0,1)$ and $p\in[1,\infty)$. If ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, ${\mathcal W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, and $\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$ are the fractional Sobolev spaces on $\Omega$ that are defined respectively via the restriction of $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\Omega$, the intrinsic Gagliardo norm, and the completion of all $C^\infty(\Omega)$ functions with compact support away from $D$, in this article we prove their equivalences [that is, ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)={\mathcal{W}}^{s,p}(\Omega) =\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$] if $\Omega$ supports a $D$-adapted fractional Hardy inequality and, moreover, when $sp\ne 1$ such a fractional Hardy inequality is shown to be necessary to guarantee these equivalences under some mild geometric conditions on $\Omega$. We also introduce new weighted fractional Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$. Using the aforementioned equivalences, we show that this new space $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$ is exactly the real interpolation space $(L^p(\Omega), \mathring{W}_D^{1,p}(\Omega))_{s,p}$ when $p\in (1,\infty)$. Applying this to the elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}_D$ in $\Omega$ with mixed boundary condition, we characterize both the domain of its fractional power and the parabolic maximal regularity of its Cauchy initial problem by means of $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Global existence and boundedness in an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system with nonlocal logistic source and sublinear productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system with nonlocal logistic source and sublinear productions \begin{align}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{rrll}
  &amp;&amp;u_t = d_1 \Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot(u^k \nabla v)+\xi \nabla\cdot(u^k \nabla w)+ \mu u^m \left(1-\int_\Omega u(x,t)\dx\right),\hspace*{0.5cm} &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\
  &amp;&amp;v_t = d_2 \Delta v-\alpha v+f(u), &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\
  &amp;&amp;w_t = d_3 \Delta w-\beta w+f(u), &amp;x\in\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\
  &amp;&amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial\nu} = 0, &amp;x\in\partial\Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\
  &amp;&amp;u(x,0) = u_0, \quad v(x,0)=v_0, \quad w(x,0)=w_0,&amp;x\in\Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{align} in an open, bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Assume the parameters $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, $\chi$, $\xi$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\mu$ are positive constants, initial data $(u_0, v_0, w_0)$ are nonnegative and the function $f(u)\leq K u^l\in C^1([0, \infty))$ for some $K, l&gt;0$. Under appropriate conditions on the parameter $k$, $l$ and $m$ we show that the above problem admits a unique globally bounded classical solution. Further, to illustrate the analytical results, some of numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <title>An improved version of a spectral inequality by Payne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated inequality by Payne relates the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian to the first eigenvalue of the buckling problem. Motivated by the goal of establishing a quantitative version of this inequality, we sho that Payne's original estimate - which is not sharp - can in fact be improved. Our result provides a refined spectral bound and opens the way to further investigations into quantitative enhancements of classical inequalities in spectral theory.</description>

      <title>The fuzzy Landau equation: global well-posedness and Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fuzzy variant of the inhomogeneous Landau equation and establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions for moderately soft potentials. The spatial delocalization introduced in the collision operator not only enhances regularity and prevents singularity formation, but also reveals additional structural properties of the model. In particular, we show that several forms of the Fisher information decay monotonically or remain uniformly bounded in time.</description>

      <title>Varifold solutions to Volume-Preserving Mean Curvature Flow: existence and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we introduce a novel weak solution concept for two-phase volume-preserving mean curvature flow, having both properties of unconditional global-in-time existence and weak-strong uniqueness. These solutions extend the ones proposed by Hensel-Laux [J. Differential Geom. 130, 209-268 (2025)] for the standard mean curvature flow, and consist in evolving varifolds coupled with the phase volumes by a transport equation. First, we show that, in the same setting as in Takasao [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 247, 52 (2023)], any sharp interface limit of solutions to a slightly modified nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a varifold solution according to our new definition. Secondly, we crucially introduce a new notion of volume-preserving gradient-flow calibrations, allowing the extended velocity vector field to point in the normal direction on the interface. We show that any sufficiently regular strong solution is calibrated in this sense. Finally, we prove that any classical solution to volume-preserving mean curvature flow, which is then automatically a calibrated flow, is unique in the class of our new varifold solutions.</description>

      <title>Critical Phenomena in Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As first discovered by Choptuik, the black hole threshold in the space of initial data for general relativity shows both surprising structure and surprising simplicity. Universality, power-law scaling of the black hole mass, and scale echoing have given rise to the term ``critical phenomena''. They are explained by the existence of exact solutions which are attractors within the black hole threshold, that is, attractors of codimension one in phase space, and which are typically self-similar. Critical phenomena give a natural route from smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity, and are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity, astrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general relativity. Major additions since the 2010 version of this review are numerical simulations beyond spherical symmetry, in particular of vacuum critical collapse, and new sections on mathematical results in PDE blowup (as a toy model for singularity formation) and on naked singularity formation in GR.</description>

      <title>Approximation of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta$-interactions supported on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the approximation of a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a singular $\delta$-potential that is formally given by $(i \nabla + A)^2 + Q + \alpha \delta_\Sigma$ by Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials in the norm resolvent sense. This is done for $\Sigma$ being the finite union of $C^2$-hypersurfaces, for coefficients $A$, $Q$, and $\alpha$ under minimal assumptions such that the associated quadratic forms are closed and sectorial, and $Q$ and $\alpha$ are allowed to be complex-valued functions. In particular, $\Sigma$ can be a graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the boundary of a piecewise $C^2$-domain. Moreover, spectral implications of the mentioned convergence result are discussed.</description>

      <title>On Axially Symmetric Perturbations of Kerr Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a positive-definite and conserved energy is a serious obstacle in the black hole stability problem. In this work, we will show that there exists a positive-definite and conserved Hamiltonian energy for axially symmetric linear perturbations of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes. In the first part, based on the Hamiltonian dimensional reduction of 3+1 axially symmetric, Ricci-flat Lorentzian spacetimes to a 2+1 Einstein-wave map system with the negatively curved hyperbolic 2-plane target, we construct a positive-definite, spacetime gauge-invariant energy functional for linear axially symmetric perturbations in the exterior of Kerr black holes, in a manner that is also gauge-independent on the target manifold. In the construction of the positive-definite energy, various dynamical terms at the boundary of the orbit space occur critically. In the second part, after setting up the initial value problem in harmonic coordinates, we prove that the positive energy for the axially symmetric linear perturbative theory of Kerr black holes is strictly conserved in time, by establishing that all the boundary terms dynamically vanish for all times. This result implies a form of dynamical linear stability of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of an overdetermined heat equation and minimal helicoids in space-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\Omega$ a smooth domain of $M$. We study the following heat diffusion problem: assume that the initial temperature is equal to $1$, uniformly on $\Omega$, and is $0$ on its complement. Heat will then flow away from $\Omega$ to its complement, and we are interested in the temperature on the boundary of $\Omega$ at all positive times $t&gt;0$. In particular we ask: are there domains for which the temperature at the boundary is a constant $c$, for all positive times $t$ and for all points of the boundary? If they exist, what can we say about their geometry?
  This is a typical example of overdetermined heat equation. It is readily seen that if $c$ exists it must be $\frac 12$, and domains with constant boundary temperature will be said to have the $\frac 12$-property. Previous work by \cite{MPS06} and \cite{CSU23} show that, on $\mathbb R^3$, the only such domains (up to congruences) have boundary which is a plane or (a bit surprisingly) the right helicoid.
  In this paper we first show that, in great generality, the boundary of a $\frac 12$-domain must be minimal; we then extend (with a different proof) the above classification from $\mathbb R^3$ to the other $3$-dimensional space-forms. We prove that, in $\mathbb S^3$, $\frac 12$-domains are bounded by a totally geodesic surface or the Clifford torus, and in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb H^3$ are bounded by a totally geodesic surface or by an (embedded) minimal hyperbolic helicoid. %(there is a one-parameter family of such surfaces) As a by-product, we extend (with a different proof) a result by Nitsche on uniformly dense domains from $\mathbb R^3$ to $3$-dimensional space-forms.</description>

      <title>Some More Sparse Bounds for Rough and Smooth Pseudodifferential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: D.~Beltran and L.~Cladek (arXiv:1711.02339) use $L^r$ to $L^s$ bounds to prove sparse form bounds for pseudodifferential operators with H\"ormander symbols in $S^m_{\rho,\delta}$ up to, but not including, the sharp end-point in decay $m$. We further develop their technique, obtaining pointwise sparse bounds for rough pseudodifferential operators that are merely bounded in their spatial variables and an alternative proof of their results which avoids proving geometrically decaying sparse bounds. We also provide sufficient conditions for sparse form bounds to hold and verify those conditions in a limited number of cases at the sharp endpoint value of $m$ for the composition of a pseudodifferential operator with the sharp maximal function.</description>

      <title>Genericity of Polyak-Lojasiewicz Inequalities for Entropic Mean-Field Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the behavior of idealized deep residual neural networks (ResNets), modeled via an optimal control problem set over continuity (or adjoint transport) equations. The continuity equations describe the statistical evolution of the features in the asymptotic regime where the layers of the network form a continuum. The velocity field is expressed through the network activation function, which is itself viewed as a function of the statistical distribution of the network parameters (weights and biases). From a mathematical standpoint, the control is interpreted in a relaxed sense, taking values in the space of probability measures over the set of parameters. We investigate the optimal behavior of the network when the cost functional arises from a regression problem and includes an additional entropic regularization term on the distribution of the parameters. In this framework, we focus in particular on the existence of stable optimizers --that is, optimizers at which the Hessian of the cost is non-degenerate. We show that, for an open and dense set of initial data, understood here as probability distributions over features and associated labels, there exists a unique stable global minimizer of the control problem. Moreover, we show that such minimizers satisfy a local Polyak--Lojasiewicz inequality, which can lead to exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient descent when the initialization lies sufficiently close to the optimal parameters. This result thus demonstrates the genericity (with respect to the distribution of features and labels) of the Polyak--Lojasiewicz condition in ResNets with a continuum of layers and under entropic penalization.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., to appear].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new class of asymptotically self-similar finite-time blowups that have two collapsing spatial scales for the 1D Constantin-Lax-Majda model. The larger spatial scale measures the decreasing distance between the bulk of the solution and the eventual blowup point, while the smaller scale measures the shrinking size of the bulk of the solution. Similar multi-scale blowup phenomena have recently been discovered for many higher dimensional equations. Our study may provide some understanding of the common mechanism behind these multi-scale blowups.</description>

      <title>Construction of smooth chiral finite-time blow-up solutions to Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS), which is an $L^{2}$-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with explicit solitons, self-duality, and pseudo-conformal symmetry. More importantly, this equation is known to be completely integrable in the Hardy space $L_{+}^{2}$ and the solutions in this class are referred to as \emph{chiral} solutions. A rigorous PDE analysis of this equation with complete integrability was recently initiated by G\'erard and Lenzmann.
  Our main result constructs smooth, chiral, and finite energy finite-time blow-up solutions with mass arbitrarily close to that of a soliton, answering the global regularity question for chiral solutions raised by G\'erard and Lenzmann. The blow-up rate obtained for these solutions is different from the pseudo-conformal rate. Our proof also gives a construction of a codimension one set of smooth finite energy initial data (but without addressing chirality) leading to the same blow-up dynamics. Our blow-up construction in the Hardy space might also be contrasted with the global well-posedness of the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS), which is another integrable $L^{2}$-critical Schr\"odinger equation.
  The overall scheme of our proof is the forward construction of blow-up dynamics with modulation analysis. We begin with developing a linear theory for the near-soliton dynamics. We discover a nontrivial conjugation identity, which unveils a surprising connection from the linearized (CM-DNLS) to the 1D free Schr\"odinger equation, which is a crucial ingredient for overcoming the difficulties from the nonlocal nonlinearity. Another principal challenge in this work, the slow decay of the soliton, is overcome by introducing a trick of decomposing solutions depending on topologies, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-posedness and higher regularity of the heat equation with Robin boundary conditions in an unbounded two-dimensional wedge is established in an $L^{2}$-setting of monomially weighted spaces. A mathematical framework is developed which allows to obtain arbitrarily high regularity without a smallness assumption on the opening angle of the wedge. The challenging aspect is that the resolvent problem exhibits two breakings of the scaling invariance, one in the equation and one in the boundary condition.</description>

Abstract: We consider the boundedness and exponential integrability of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the degenerate elliptic equation \[ -v^{-1}\mathrm{Div}(|\sqrt{Q}\nabla u|^{p-2}Q\nabla u)=f|f|^{p-2}- v^{-1}\mathrm{Div}(v|g|^{p-2}g \mathbf{t}), \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty, \] assuming that there is a Sobolev inequality of the form \[ \|\varphi\|_{L^N(v,\Omega)}\leq S_N\|\sqrt{Q} \varphi\|_{L^p(\Omega)}, \] where $N$ is a power function of the form $N(t)=t^{\sigma p}$, $\sigma\geq 1$, or a Young function of the form $N(t)=t^p\log(e+t)^\sigma$, $\sigma&gt;1$. In our results we study the interplay between the Sobolev inequality and the regularity assumptions needed on $f$ and $g$ to prove that the solution is bounded or is exponentially integrable. Our results generalize those previously proved in previous work by the authors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider three-dimensional water waves with vorticity, under the action of gravity. We discuss a generalized Zakharov-Craig-Sulem formulation of the problem introduced by Castro and Lannes, which involves a generalized Dirichlet-Neumann operator. We study this operator in detail, extending some well-known results about the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator for irrotational water waves, such as the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, the computation of its differential and a paralinearization result. We stress the fact that no geometric condition on either the velocity field or the vorticity is assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove $L^p$-Hardy inequalities with distance to the boundary for domains in the Heisenberg group ${\mathbb{H}}^n$, $n\geq 1$. Our results are based on a certain geometric condition. This is first implemented for the Euclidean distance in certain non-convex domains. It is then implemented for the distance defined by the gauge quasi-norm related to the fundamental solution of the horizontal Laplacian when the domain is a half-space or a convex polytope. Finally it is implemented for the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance on half-spaces and arbitrary bounded convex domains of ${\mathbb{H}}^n$. In all cases the constant $((p-1)/p)^p$ is obtained. In the more general context of a stratified Lie group of step two we study the superharmonicity and the weak $H$-concavity of the Euclidean distance to the boundary, thus obtaining an alternative proof for the $L^2$-Hardy inequality on convex domains.</description>

In the present paper, we will show the global existence of small solution $u$ for $p\geq p_{conf}(2,\mu)$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. In forthcoming papers, we shall show the global existence of small solution $u$ for the remaining cases of $\mu&gt;2, p&gt;2$ or $\mu=1, p&gt;p_s(\mu+2)=1+\sqrt 2$.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the stability conditions for the well-posedness of the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of conducting perfect fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. Due to the counterexamples constructed by C. Hao and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286], the plasma-vacuum problems violating the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition and without surface tension are believed to be highly unstable or even ill-posed. However, based on a geometric perspective, we demonstrate that, although the initial data provided therein are ill-posed in the Lagrangian framework characterizing the regularity of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with such initial data can still be stable/well-posed in the Eulerian setting without involving flow maps, under the hypothesis that the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. This discloses the essential difference of the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks of MHD free boundary problems and the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. Moreover, we also consider the consider the surface tension effect and establish the local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces in this case. Furthermore, under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure, we prove vanishing surface tension limits. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, and the stabilizing effect of surface tension is stronger than that of the tangential magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and leapfrogging phenomena of multiple helical vortices for 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of helical vortices without swirl for the incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb R^3$ under general initial assumptions. Assume the initial helical vorticity is sharply concentrated in $N$ distinct $\ep$-neighborhoods, whose mutual distances vanish as $O(1/|\ln \ep|)$, and each vortex core possesses vorticity mass of order $1/|\ln \ep|^{1+b}$ for an arbitrary fixed $b\in\mathbb R$. We prove that as $\ep\to 0$, the motion of these helical vortices converges uniformly to a dynamical system derived herein over a time interval of order $1/|\ln\varepsilon|^{1-b}$. In the particular case $b=-1$, our results establish the evolution counterpart for interacting vortex helices constructed in [I. Guerra, M. Musso, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'aire, 2025]. Notably, for two interacting helical vortices with initial mutual distance $ \rho_0/|\ln \ep|$, by choosing $\rho_0$ sufficiently small, our analysis extends to timescales covering multiple periods. This result provides the first mathematical justification for the numerically observed phenomenon termed ``leapfrogging of Kelvin waves" reported in [N. Hietala et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2016].</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of solutions to the semilinear equation with a slightly supercritical exponent in dimension three,
  \begin{align*}
  -\Delta u=K(x) u^{5+\mu},\quad u&gt;0 ~\text{in}~ \mathbf{B}, \quad u=0 ~\text{on}~ \partial \mathbf{B},
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu &gt;0$, $\mathbf{B}$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $K(x)$ is a nonnegative radial function under suitable condition on $K$. We prove the existence of positive multi-peak solutions for $\mu&gt;0$ small enough. All peaks of our solutions approach the boundary $\partial\mathbf{B}$ as $\mu\rightarrow 0$. Moreover, the number of peaks varies with the parameter $\mu$ as $\mu$ goes to $0^+$.
  Note that the case $n\geq 4$ was considered by Liu and Peng \cite{LiuPeng2016}.</description>

Abstract: The Constantin-Lax-Majda (CLM) model and the De Gregorio model which is a modification of the CLM model are well-known for their ability to emulate the behavior of the 3D Euler equations, particularly their potential to develop finite-time singularities. The stability properties of the De Gregorio model on the torus near the ground state $-\sin\theta$ have been well studied. However, the stability analysis near excited states $-\sin k\theta$ with $k\ge 2$ remains challenging. This paper focuses on analyzing the stability and instability of the De Gregorio model on torus around the first excited state $-\sin 2\theta$. The linear and nonlinear instability are established for a broad class of initial data, while nonlinear stability is proved for another large class of initial data in this paper. Our analysis reveals that solution behavior to the De Gregorio model near excited states demonstrates different stability patterns depending on initial conditions. One of new ingredients in our instability analysis involves deriving a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the Fourier coefficients of solutions and examining the spectral properties of a positive definite quadratic form emerging from this ODE. The approach of this paper would be applicable to other related models and problems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Lavrentiev Phenomenon in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify and extend insights from Lavrentiev's seminal paper. We examine the original theorem on the absence of the Lavrentiev's phenomenon and a counterexample offering a detailed analysis of its proof and providing a new, concise, and complete reasoning. In the appendix, we also provide additional details to supplement the original proof.</description>
