      <title>Constraining symmetron fields with a levitated optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetron, one of the light scalar fields introduced by dark energy theories, is thought to modify the gravitational force when it couples to matter. However, detecting the symmetron field is challenging due to its screening behavior in the high-density environment of traditional measurements. In this paper, we propose a scheme to set constraints on the parameters of the symmetron with a levitated optomechanical system, in which a nanosphere serves as a testing mass coupled to an optical cavity. By measuring the frequency shift of the probe transmission spectrum, we can establish constraints for our scheme by calculating the symmetron-induced influence. These refined constraints improve by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to current force-based detection methods, which offer new opportunities for the dark energy detection.</description>

      <title>Constraining model parameters in f(Q,C) gravity: Observational analysis and geometric diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of $f(Q,C)$ gravity with $f(Q,C)=\alpha Q+\beta C$, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $C$ encapsulates cosmological expansion terms. Three parameterizations of the EoS for dark energy, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\omega_{1}z$, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z(1+z)}{1+z^{2}}$ and $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z^{2}}{1+z^{2}}$ are tested using the Hubble, Hubble plus BAO, and Hubble plus BAO plus Pantheon datasets to constrain model parameters. The resulting Hubble and deceleration parameters reveal a transition from deceleration to acceleration, supporting current cosmic acceleration observations. Analysis of the energy density and pressure confirms positive energy density and a negative pressure for dark energy, potentially driving the late-time acceleration. We examine energy conditions, showing compliance with NEC, WEC and DEC, while SEC remains negative, supporting an accelerated expansion. Statefinder diagnostics suggest that two of the EoS parameterizations lead to Quintessence-like behavior with a time-varying dark energy component, while the third closely approaches $\Lambda$CDM showing slight deviations consistent with recent observations. Sound speed analysis demonstrates the physical stability of all parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Extremal Kerr-Schild Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel ansatz, where the full black hole geometry is written as a linear in mass perturbation of the associated extremal black hole base. Contrary to its "standard" version, the corresponding "extremal Kerr-Schild form" is no longer restricted to special algebraic type spacetimes, and is applicable to numerous black hole solutions with matter, such as the charged Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes, black holes of $D=5$ minimal gauged supergravity, or the charged dilaton-axion rotating solutions. This ansatz is likely to find its applications in black hole perturbation theory, shed new light on the CFT description of non-extremal black holes, as well as be useful for constructing new exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Ringdown Analysis of Rotating Black Holes in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes were recently computed in a generic effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with higher-derivative corrections. We exploit this breakthrough to perform the most complete search for signatures of new physics in black hole spectra to date. We construct a template that describes the post-merger gravitational-wave emission in comparable-mass binary black hole mergers at current detector sensitivity, notably including isospectrality breaking. The analysis of all events with detectable quasinormal-driven ringdown signatures yields no evidence of higher-derivative corrections in the spectra, and we set an upper bound $\ell \lesssim$ 35 km on the length scale of new physics. Looking ahead, our scheme enables new studies on the capabilities of future detectors to robustly search for signatures of new gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>$C^{k}$-regular extremal black holes in maximally-symmetric spacetime and the third law of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the proof of Ryan Unger and Christoph Kehle's work, "Gravitational collapse to extremal black holes and the third law of black hole thermodynamics", to construct examples of black hole formation from regular, one-ended asymptotically flat Cauchy data for the Einstein-Maxwell charged scalar field system in maximally-symmetric 3+1 dimensional spacetime which are exactly isometric to $dS_{4}/AdS_{4}$ Reissner N\"ordstrom black holes after a finite advanced time along the event horizon. Furthermore, the apparent horizon coincides with that of a vacuum at finite advanced time.
  This paper exists as an extension of the aforementioned work done by Unger and Kehle which disproves the "third law of black hole thermodynamics" originally posed by Hawking and Bardeen's "The Four Laws of Black Hole Mechanics". We begin with a brief introduction to the history of black hole thermodynamics, tracing the the lineage of the third law of black hole thermodynamics up to Kehle &amp; Unger's 2022 work; the basepoint for our extension to dS/AdS spacetime. We adapt the machinery from Kehle and Unger to Schwarzschild and Reissner-N\"ordstrom solutions in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$ spacetime. Then, we study the relevant manifold gluing theory and reprove necessary gluing theorems in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$. Finally, we provide analysis of the third law of black hole thermodynamics in these maximally symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests the nonlinearity of the gravitation, reflects the degenerate gravitational vacua, and indicates the types of the asymptotic symmetries. However, by the received wisdom, it would be challenging to detect it. In this Letter, we envisioned employing the space-borne interferometer, especially DECIGO, to detect memory signals generated by the stellar-mass binary black hole (BBHs) systems, the conventional targets of the ground-based detectors. We estimated that during its 5 years' observation, DECIGO could detect nearly 2,258 loud enough memory signals. Among them, 102 have signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8. Our prediction was obtained with the BBH population model constrained by the recent gravitational wave observations in GWTC-3. The Power Law + Peak mass model and the DEFAULT spin model were employed, and the merger rate was chosen to be proportional to the Madau-Dickinson formation rate. In the analysis, the impact of the orbital eccentricity was also considered. The high rate is due to the sufficiently strong memory signal right at the bandwidth of DECIGO, and also because of the humongous number of the surely existing stellar-mass BBHs. The substantial, and yet conservative, number of detections enables to leverage statistical approaches to harness the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Black hole tunneling in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Perturbative black-hole and horizon solutions in gravity with explicit spacetime-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present static and spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the mass-dimension $d\leq 4$ action of an effective-field theory, choosing the diffeomorphism symmetry to be broken explicitly. By using the reduced-action method with a Schwarzschild seed-solution, we find static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions to the field equations to linear order in the symmetry-breaking coefficients, which are consistent solutions to the modified Einstein equations at the same order. Using several ans\"atze for the symmetry-breaking coefficient we classify the allowed solutions, and we compute standard consequences and observables, including horizons, thermodynamics, photon geodesics, and perihelion precession. We find that the horizon structure of some of our solutions are similar to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, and that several of them exhibit physical singularities at $r=2M$. We note in particular that introducing more than one non-zero coefficient for spacetime-symmetry breaking coefficient leads to a solution with three horizons; the aim is to obtain observables that can be confronted to black holes observational data.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <title>First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scale factor Duality Symmetry in Symmetric Teleparallel Scalar-tensor FLRW Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry for the dilaton field in scalar-tensor theory and its extension in teleparallelism. Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric cosmology. For the three possible connections, we write the corresponding point-like Lagrangians for the gravitational field equations, and we construct discrete transformations which generalize the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry. The discrete transformations depend on the parameter which defines the coupling between the scalar field and the nonmetricity scalar. The Gasperini-Veneziano duality symmetry is recovered for a specific limit of this free parameter. Furthermore, we derive the conservation laws for the classical field equations for these models, and we present the origin of the discrete transformations. Finally, we discuss the integrability properties of the model, and exact solutions are determined.</description>

      <title>A one-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable post processing which allows us to formulate a generic semi-analytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies here discussed will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions in teleparallel $F(T,B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find several teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for a Robertson-Walker (TRW) cosmological spacetime. We first set and solve the $F(T,B)$-type field equations for a linear perfect fluid. Using similar techniques, we then find new $F(T,B)$ solutions for non-linear perfect fluids with a weak-quadratic correction term to the linear equation of state (EoS). Finally, we solve for new classes of $F(T,B)$ solutions for a scalar field source by assuming a power-law scalar field and then an exponential scalar field in terms of the time-coordinate. For flat cosmological cases ($k=0$ cases), we find new exact and approximate $F(T,B)$ solutions. For non-flat cases ($k=\pm 1$ cases), we only find new teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for some specific and well-defined cosmological expansion subcases. We conclude by briefly discussing the impact of these new teleparallel solutions on cosmological processes such as dark energy quintessence and phantom energy models.</description>

Abstract: This series of three lectures was presented at ``Escola de Cosmologia e Gravita\c{c}\~ao" \url{https://cosmosecontexto.org.br/ecg-inscricoes} and webcast at \url{https://shorturl.at/2ZSI7} -- in Portuguese, but slides in English.
  We will go through a brief review on $f(R)$ theories (in the metric approach) and the usual requirements for successful modifications of General Relativity. Then we will open a large parenthesis to talk about a non-standard approach to Phase Transitions: the Catastrophe Theory. Finally, we will connect the previous lectures to introduce a new Thermodynamic interpretation of $f(R)$ theories.</description>

      <title>Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Mimicking a rotating black hole with nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit the first analogue model of a rotating black hole constructed in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The background electromagnetic field is assumed to be algebraically special and adapted to a geodesic shear-free congruence of null rays in Minkowski spacetime, the Kerr congruence. The corresponding optical metric has a Kerr-Schild form and, it is shown to be characterized by three parameters, thus predicting the existence of an ergosurface, a horizon, and a slice identical to one also present in the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <title>On the evidence of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in capturing the dynamical behavior of dark energy, we assess the model dependence of the evidence for dynamical dark energy inferred from the DESI BAO data. While the DESI BAO data slightly tightens the constraints on model parameters and increases the tension between the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the influence of DESI BAO data on the constraint of $w_0$ is small in the SSLCPL model. In comparison to the CPL model, the tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model is reduced for the SSLCPL model, suggesting that the evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI BAO data is dependent on cosmological models. The inclusion of spatial curvature has little impact on the results in the SSLCPL model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic censorship in a (dual) collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter space in holographic models in which the ground state is described by a good singularity. These include supersymmetric truncations of string/M-theory, for which a positive-energy theorem holds. At the boundary, our solutions describe a boost-invariant fluid in which the temperature decreases monotonically with time. On the gravity side, they correspond to black-brane spacetimes with a receding horizon. In classical gravity, curvature invariants at the horizon grow without bound. In the full theory this regime may or may not be reached. In some cases it is avoided by a phase transition to a regular geometry. In others it is reached but the boundary hydrodynamic evolution can be continued, provided the equation of state at parametrically small energies is known. Both cases require the inclusion of finite-$N$ or finite-coupling effects.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-Luminosity Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux, photon ring radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.</description>

      <title>A Novel Test for MOND: Gravitational Lensing by Disc Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a number count of disc galaxy lenses of one order of magnitude higher than the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we show that disc galaxy gravitational lensing can be used to strongly constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider magnetically charged AdS black branes with vanishing entropy at zero temperature. We argue that in the presence of a large enough Chern-Simons coupling the quasi normal modes of the brane will have a diminishing imaginary part. Since our result is agnostic to the matter content of the theory it implies that, generically, the boundary theory will possess long lived modes which should be observable in a proper setting.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study a holographic diffeomorphism invariant higher-derivative extension of Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) cosmological gravity in the context of Wald's formalism. We calculate the entropy, mass and angular momentum of warped anti-de Sitter (WAdS$_3$) black holes in ghost-free BHT massive gravity and its extension using the covariant phase space method. We also compute the central charges of the dual boundary conformal field theories (CFT) from the thermodynamics method.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Electromagnetic radiation with an angular frequency equal to half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: We identify a minisuperspace of complex deformations of ABJM theory for which the partition function specifies the amplitude of an eternally inflating universe. The boundary theory predicts that the bosonic bulk is effectively in the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary state, with a subleading 'tunneling' contribution. This holographic model of inflation also reveals a close connection between the swampland distance and cobordism conjectures, and the condition for the asymptotic wave function to predict classical behavior in geometry and fields.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of one-loop corrections on long CMB scale modes in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase is under debate. In this work, we investigate the regularization and renormalization of the one-loop corrections of curvature perturbation power spectrum. Employing the UV-IR regularizations and performing the in-in analysis, we calculate the regularized one-loop corrections, including tadpole, in the power spectrum associated with cubic and quartic Hamiltonians. We show that the fully regularized and renormalized fractional loop correction in the power spectrum is controlled by the peak of the power spectrum at the end of USR phase, scaling like $ e^{6 \Delta {\cal N}}$ in which $\Delta {\cal N} $ is the duration of the USR phase. This confirms the original conclusion that the loop corrections can get out of perturbative control if the transition from the intermediate USR phase to the final SR phase is instantaneous and sharp.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation in this work is due to the great importance of relativistic boson stars as fierce competitors of black holes. From theoretical perspective, they described by complex Klein Gordon (KG) scalar fields interacting with curved background in general form. In this work we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (EKG) scalar tensor gravity in presence of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential to study formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation of its stability. We choose the CW potential because of its important role in description of cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Loop Quantum Gravity: symmetry reduction preserving gauge degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we successfully identify a cosmological sector for General Relativity in Ashtekar variables, which preserves the SU(2) gauge structure of the theory. As a consequence, we proceed to quantize it using the machinery of Loop Quantum Gravity, uncovering that the resulting Hilbert space is generated by spin-network states that exhibit distinctive symmetry properties and encompass the usual states of Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Toward regular black holes in sixth-derivative gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric static solutions of the most general sixth-derivative gravity using series expansions. Specifically, we prove that the only solutions of the complete theory (i.e., with generic coupling constants) that possess a Frobenius expansion around the origin, $r=0$, are necessarily regular. When restricted to specific branches of theories (i.e., imposing particular constraints on the coupling constants), families of potentially singular solutions emerge. By expanding around $r=r_0 \neq 0$, we identify solutions with black hole horizons. Finally, we argue that, unlike in fourth-derivative gravity, the conditions $R=0$ and $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ are too restrictive for sixth-derivative gravity solutions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phase description of charged 4D Gauss-Bonnet black holes in a quantum regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glavan and Lin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081301 (2020)] have recently proposed a model of GB gravity in four spacetime dimensions. This model predicts significant contributions of the GB coupling parameter $\alpha$ to gravitational dynamics, while circumventing the Lovelock theorem and avoiding Ostrogradsky instability. As a powerful competitor to general relativity (GR), the model has been examined on various phenomenological grounds. Here, we employ a technique from information geometry to analyze the thermodynamic phase structure of a charged black hole with a quantum gravity-inspired entropy relation in this novel modified gravity theory scenario. Based on the sign and magnitude of thermodynamic curvature, we demonstrate that while the theory does not significantly impact larger black holes, it may lead to multiple phase transitions and accelerate the formation of black hole remnants at short-distance scales compared to GR. Our analysis focuses solely on the non-extremal geometry case where $M&gt;\sqrt{Q^2+\alpha}$, with $M$ and $Q$ representing the mass and charge of the black hole, respectively. Moreover, since black hole thermodynamics can be effectively analyzed through quantum thermodynamics at microscopic scales, we compute the quantum work associated with the evaporation process of a black hole and demonstrate its intricate behavior in smaller geometric regimes. We believe that these results may offer insights for testing the phenomenological consistency of the theory as a potential alternative to the standard Einstein paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows the analysis of perturbations with Kerr-like asymptotics well inside the Melvin radius, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically compute the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in Type III hilltop inflation models under the slow-roll approximation. The model parameters are constrained using current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The curvature perturbations that exit the horizon at small scales show sufficiently large amplitudes to produce primordial black holes (PBHs). We then consider the quantum one-loop corrections in these models from both the self-interaction of the inflaton and its interaction with the waterfall field. We show the loop corrections in both cases for 60 e-folds of inflation are negligible, ensuring the tree-level results are reliable within the chosen parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes of neutron stars are an exciting prospect for analyzing the internal composition of NSs and studying matter at high densities. In this work, we focus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple with gravitational waves. We construct two different equation of state ensembles, one without and one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes might help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions in the $65\%$ and $95\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time relations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order oscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are beyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The quasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective in differentiating the equation of state ensembles, as they obscure the details of the equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach to embedding the renormalization group running of Newton's constant and the cosmological constant in gravity is proposed. This approach is based on a gravitational Lagrangian that gives rise to a new class of modified gravity theories where $G$ and $\Lambda$ are spacetime-dependent functions. The Lagrangian formulation can be interpreted as an effective gravitational action that encapsulates the scale dependence of $G$, arising from quantum effects in the early universe. We show that the new formalism can be discussed in the framework of Horndeski modified gravity and apply to explore a non-singular cosmology featuring power-law inflation. In particular, we discuss the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations within this framework.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian observables for aligned-spin binaries to sixth order in spin from gravitational self-force and Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of compact binaries is essential for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, with spin being an important effect to include in waveform models. In this paper, we derive new post-Newtonian (PN) results for the conservative aligned-spin dynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order for the spin$^3$ and spin$^4$ contributions, in addition to the next-to-leading order (NLO) spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ contributions. One approach we follow is the Tutti Frutti method, which relates PN and gravitational self-force results through the redshift and spin-precession invariants, by making use of the simple dependence of the scattering angle on the symmetric mass ratio. However, an ambiguity arises at the NLO spin$^5$ contribution, due to transcendental functions of the Kerr spin in the redshift; this is also the order at which Compton amplitudes calculations are affected by spurious poles. Therefore, we follow an additional approach to determine the NLO spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ dynamics: using on-shell Compton amplitudes obtained from black hole perturbation theory. The Compton amplitude used in this work is composed of the unambiguous tree-level far-zone part reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084071 (2024)], as well as the full, non-interfering with the far-zone, $\ell=2$ partial wave contributions from the near zone, which are responsible for capturing Kerr finite-size effects. Other results in this paper include deriving the scattering angle of a spinning test body in a Kerr background from a parametrized worldline action, and computing the redshift and spin-precession invariants for eccentric orbits without an eccentricity expansion.</description>

      <title>Probing the Effective Quantum Gravity via Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two quantum-corrected black hole models have recently been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraints approach to quantum gravity, maintaining general covariance \cite{Zhang:2024khj}. We have studied the quasinormal spectra of these black holes using four methods: the higher-order WKB approach with Pad\'e approximants, time-domain integration, Frobenius, and pseudospectral methods. The Frobenius method, in particular, allows us to determine precise values of the frequencies, including the overtones. The two models differ in their choice of quantum parameter $\xi$, and we can distinguish them by their quasinormal spectra. In the first model, increasing the quantum parameter results in higher real oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the fundamental mode. In contrast, the second model shows a decrease in the oscillation frequency of the least-damped mode when the quantum parameter is introduced. We have shown that, while the fundamental mode changes relatively gradually with the quantum parameter, the first few overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild limits at an increasing rate. This results in a qualitatively new behavior: the real parts of the frequencies of the first and higher overtones tend to zero as the quantum parameter increases. In addition to the branch of modes that are perturbative in the quantum parameter, we observe some non-perturbative modes at moderate values of the quantum parameter.
  Additionally, we have calculated the radii of the shadows cast by these black holes and discussed possible constraints based on observations of Sgt $A^*$. As a byproduct, we tested the method of calculating quasinormal modes of this kind based on a recent agnostic parametrization and showed that while the parametrized formalism could be used for estimating the fundamental mode at small values of the coupling, it is insufficient even for the lowest overtones.</description>

Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>Interacting Models of Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the interacting models between the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field and the dark matter fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic background. A key feature of GB coupling models is the varying speed of gravitational waves (GWs). We utilize recent constraints on the GW speed and conduct our analysis in two primary scenarios: model-dependent and model-independent. In the model-dependent scenario, where determining the GW speed requires a specific GB coupling functional form, we choose an exponential GB coupling. We adopt a dynamical system analysis to obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters that describe different phases of the universe and produce a stable late-time accelerating solution following the GW constraint, and find that to satisfy all these constraints, fine-tuning of the free parameters involved in the models is often needed. In the model-independent scenario, the GW speed is fixed to one, and we construct the autonomous system to identify the late-time stable accelerating critical points. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian inference method using late-time observational data sets, including 31 data points from cosmic chronometer data (Hubble data) and 1701 data points from Pantheon+ and find that all the observational constraints can be satisfied without fine-tuning. In addition, we also utilize simulated binned Roman and LSST data to study the evolution of the universe in the model-independent scenario. We find that the model shows significant deviation at higher redshifts from $\Lambda$CDM and fits the current data much better than $\Lambda$CDM within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and demonstrate that an analogue gravity model going beyond the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This requires that one expands to second order in perturbation amplitude and thus takes the intrinsic nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that, as a result, significant modifications of the standard paradigm occur. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal mean-field expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh acoustic spacetime metric and, to subleading order $1/N$, two emergent vector fields and a mass term. Both the renormalized metric as well as the vector fields and the mass then keep track of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to the quantum many-body backreaction exerted by the excitation cloud.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of high order correction for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Measurements with the Photon Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes, including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent ($\gamma$) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the time delay ($\tau$) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter ($\delta$) relates their relative orientations on the image plane. Our investigation reveals distinct responses of these critical parameters to black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination: $\gamma$ is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, $\tau$ is strongly affected by inclination, especially for near-extremal black holes, and $\delta$ is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in $\gamma$, $\tau$, and $\delta$ across all possible inclinations is $\lesssim 10\%$, $\lesssim 20\%$, and $\lesssim 60\%$, respectively. By contrast, the Kerr shadow size varies by only $\lesssim 8\%$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Stability of Euclidean 3-space for the positive mass theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stable for the Positive Mass Theorem in the following sense. Let $(M_i,g_i)$ be a sequence of complete asymptotically flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and suppose that the ADM mass $m(g_i)$ of one end of $M_i$ converges to $0$. Then for all $i$, there is a subset $Z_i$ in $M_i$ such that $M_i\setminus Z_i$ contains the given end, the area of the boundary $\partial Z_i$ converges to zero, and $(M_i\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology for any choice of basepoints. This confirms a conjecture of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen. Additionally, we find an almost quadratic upper bound for the area of $\partial Z_i$ in terms of $m(g_i)$. As an application of the main result, we also prove R. Bartnik's strict positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Classification of higher grade $\ell$ graphs for $\mathrm{U}(N)^2\times \mathrm{O}(D)$ multi-matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The authors studied in [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e D 9, 367-433, (2022)], a complex multi-matrix model with $\mathrm{U}(N)^2 \times \mathrm{O}(D)$ symmetry, and whose double scaling limit where simultaneously the large-$N$ and large-$D$ limits were taken while keeping the ratio $N/\sqrt{D}=M$ finite and fixed. In this double scaling limit, the complete recursive characterization of the Feynman graphs of arbitrary genus for the leading order grade $\ell=0$ was achieved. In this current study, we classify the higher order graphs in $\ell$. More specifically, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ with arbitrary genus, in addition to a specific class of two-particle-irreducible (2PI) graphs for higher $\ell \geqslant 3$ but with genus zero. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each 2PI graph with a single $\mathrm{O}(D)$-loop with an arbitrary $\ell$ corresponds to a reduced alternating knot diagram with $\ell$ crossings as listed in the Rolfsen knot table, or a resulting alternating knot diagram obtained after performing the Tait flyping moves. We generalize to 2PR by considering the connected sum and the Reidemeister move I.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays require hierarchical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array projects have found evidence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) using data from an ensemble of pulsars. In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise. These assumptions are encoded as uninformative priors in Bayesian searches, though Frequentist approaches make similar assumptions. Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both Frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this letter, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble. Results by Pulsar Timing Array projects should be re-evaluated using Hierarchical Models.</description>

The latest version improves package efficiency and implements new physical models. We discover recurrent relations between metric factors that enhance computational efficiency.

      <title>Use Model Averaging instead of Model Selection in Pulsar Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)] proposed a universal classification scheme that interprets black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space, and then divides black hole solutions into four distinct classes, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$, offering insights into deeper aspects of black hole thermodynamics and gravity. In this paper, we investigate the universal thermodynamic topological classification of the singly rotating Kerr black holes in all dimensions, as well as the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole. We show that the innermost small black hole states of the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable, while those of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, the outermost large black holes exhibit unstable behavior in all these cases. At the low-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have one large thermodynamically unstable black hole, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes feature one large unstable branch and one small stable branch. Conversely, at the high-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes exhibit a small unstable black hole state, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have no black hole states at all. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{1-}$, whereas the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman and $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{0+}$, thereby further support the conjecture proposed in [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)].</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Here we give it a possible description via probability distributions of energy and/or degrees of freedom. There are parameter spaces that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It has been recently suggested that EMRIs and IMRIs can both form in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Considering the likely encounter between a sBH and an IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I showed that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with a more sophisticated model. We first use 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration of a sBH in the vicinity of an IMBH. We find that the gaseous torque, together with the tidal torque exerted by the IMBH, can drive synchronized migration until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body code to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime. We find that the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in either two subsequent IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. These events will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>

Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>
