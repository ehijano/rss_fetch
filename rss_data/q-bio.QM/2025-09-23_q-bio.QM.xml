      <title>TF-DWGNet: A Directed Weighted Graph Neural Network with Tensor Fusion for Multi-Omics Cancer Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration and analysis of multi-omics data provide valuable insights for cancer subtype classification. However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities. These results highlight TF-DWGNet's potential for effective and interpretable multi-omics integration in cancer research.</description>

      <title>Comment on "mbtransfer: Microbiome intervention analysis using transfer functions and mirror statistics": Implementation errors, theoretical misapplication, and methodological flaws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a number of errors in "mbtransfer: Microbiome intervention analysis using transfer functions and mirror statistics" PLOS Comp Bio (2024) spanning multiple aspects of the paper. The wrong inputs were provided to comparator methods for model training, when forecasting one method was provided initial conditions in the wrong units, and performance metrics were calculated without proper unit conversion. The false discovery rate and power analysis conclusions provided in the text are not supported by theory or the empirical testing that was performed within the paper. The paper also has data leakage issues, equations are written down incorrectly, and incorrect definitions/terminology are used.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Antimicrobial Molecule Prediction via Dynamic Routing Capsule Networks and Multi-Source Molecular Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibiotics are a vital class of drugs closely associated with the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Accurate prediction of molecular antimicrobial activity remains a key challenge in the pursuit of novel antibiotic candidates. However, laboratory-based antimicrobial compounds identification is costly, time-consuming, and prone to rediscovering known antibiotics, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate computational models. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced the ability to explore chemical space and identify potential antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we particularly emphasize deep learning models and employ five chemistry language models tailored for chemical data to encode small molecules. Our model incorporates a unique capsule network architecture and introduces innovations in loss function selection and feature processing modules, demonstrating superior performance in predicting inhibitory activities against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. We conducted a series of ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of network design and input features. Case studies validated the usability and effectiveness of our model.To facilitate accessibility, we developed an intuitive web portal to disseminate this novel tool. Our results indicate that the proposed approach offers improved predictive accuracy and enhanced interpretability, underscoring the potential of interpretable artificial intelligence methods in accelerating antibiotic discovery and addressing the urgent challenge of antimicrobial resistance.</description>

      <title>Discrete Heat Kernels on Simplicial Complexes and Its Application to Functional Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks constitute fundamental organizational structures across biological systems, although conventional graph-theoretic analyses capture exclusively pairwise interactions, thereby omitting the intricate higher-order relationships that characterize network complexity. This work proposes a unified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending classical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and higher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel on a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals on $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\partial_k$. Computationally efficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed to implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology generalizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary structure to localize topological features while maintaining homological invariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement across vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to parcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that simplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying coherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for computational neuroscience applications.</description>

      <title>A Sensitivity Analysis Methodology For Rule-Based Stochastic Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.
  Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.
  Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software M{\O}D for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.</description>

      <title>Why we need all the organisms: an exploration of the Monarch knowledge graph to aid mechanism discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research done using model organisms has been fundamental to the biological understanding of human genes, diseases and phenotypes. Model organisms provide tractable systems for experiments to enhance understanding of biological mechanisms conserved across the evolutionary tree. Decades of model organism research has generated vast amounts of data; however, this data is split across many domains, organisms, and biological fields of research. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a computational way to aggregate and compile disparate information in a parsable format. By unifying data across studies, organisms and time points, KG researchers can create novel targeted hypotheses. Here we demonstrate how model organisms are connected to humans and other organisms through genes, diseases and phenotypes allowing for a broader understanding of genetic biology than just one organism alone can provide. Utilizing resources such as the Monarch KG is a great way to reduce redundant experiments and find directions previously unexplored.</description>

      <title>Causality-Induced Positional Encoding for Transformer-Based Representation Learning of Non-Sequential Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength &amp; causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/CAPE.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Discovery of Neural Circuits in Spatially Patterned Neural Responses with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</description>

      <title>Rational Multi-Modal Transformers for TCR-pMHC Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is fundamental to adaptive immunity and central to the development of T cell-based immunotherapies. While transformer-based models have shown promise in predicting TCR-pMHC interactions, most lack a systematic and explainable approach to architecture design. We present an approach that uses a new post-hoc explainability method to inform the construction of a novel encoder-decoder transformer model. By identifying the most informative combinations of TCR and epitope sequence inputs, we optimize cross-attention strategies, incorporate auxiliary training objectives, and introduce a novel early-stopping criterion based on explanation quality. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance while simultaneously improving explainability, robustness, and generalization. This work establishes a principled, explanation-driven strategy for modeling TCR-pMHC binding and offers mechanistic insights into sequence-level binding behavior through the lens of deep learning.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and Computational Radiobiology for Precision Radiopharmaceutical Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews the evolving field of radiobiology, emphasizing the need for advanced multiscale, mechanistic models to optimize radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). While the traditional linear-quadratic (LQ) model underpins external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), RPT's unique biological and spatial complexities demand new approaches. First-principles simulations of DNA damage, repair, and multicellular responses are crucial for understanding therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The integration of these models into personalized, digital twin frameworks promises transformative clinical applications, but progress depends on deep mechanistic insights, experimental validation, and balancing model complexity with practicality for clinical use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) has emerged as a powerful simulation-based approach for estimating complex mechanistic models, offering fast posterior sampling via generative neural networks. However, extending ABI to hierarchical models, a cornerstone of modern Bayesian analysis, remains a major challenge due to the need to simulate massive data sets and estimate thousands of parameters. In this work, we build on compositional score matching (CSM), a divide-and-conquer strategy for Bayesian updating using diffusion models. To address existing stability issues of CSM in dealing with large data sets, we couple adaptive solvers with a novel, error-damping compositional estimator. Our estimator remains stable even with hundreds of thousands of data points and parameters. We validate our approach on a controlled toy example, a high-dimensional autoregressive model, and a real-world advanced microscopy application involving over 750,000 parameters.</description>

      <title>Randomness in appendage coordination facilitates strenuous ground self-righting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is common in biological and artificial systems, resulting either from stochasticity of the environment or noise in organisms or devices themselves. In locomotor control, randomness is typically considered a nuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain leads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system around limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is beneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation modeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in cockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is present. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating similar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg coordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to the time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was for the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to self-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase between wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting outcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited the system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the metastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and had a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study complements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize locomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a situation common in strenuous locomotion.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Clinical Decision-Making: Integrating Multi-Agent Systems with Ethical AI Governance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the data-driven medicine approach, which integrates ethically managed and explainable artificial intelligence into clinical decision support systems (CDSS), are critical to ensure reliable and effective patient care. This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59\%, 56\%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</description>

      <title>DPASyn: Mechanism-Aware Drug Synergy Prediction via Dual Attention and Precision-Aware Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug combinations are essential in cancer therapy, leveraging synergistic drug-drug interactions (DDI) to enhance efficacy and combat resistance. However, the vast combinatorial space makes experimental screening impractical, and existing computational models struggle to capture the complex, bidirectional nature of DDIs, often relying on independent drug encoding or simplistic fusion strategies that miss fine-grained inter-molecular dynamics. Moreover, state-of-the-art graph-based approaches suffer from high computational costs, limiting scalability for real-world drug discovery. To address this, we propose DPASyn, a novel drug synergy prediction framework featuring a dual-attention mechanism and Precision-Aware Quantization (PAQ). The dual-attention architecture jointly models intra-drug structures and inter-drug interactions via shared projections and cross-drug attention, enabling fine-grained, biologically plausible synergy modeling. While this enhanced expressiveness brings increased computational resource consumption, our proposed PAQ strategy complements it by dynamically optimizing numerical precision during training based on feature sensitivity-reducing memory usage by 40% and accelerating training threefold without sacrificing accuracy. With LayerNorm-stabilized residual connections for training stability, DPASyn outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods on the O'Neil dataset (13,243 combinations) and supports full-batch processing of up to 256 graphs on a single GPU, setting a new standard for efficient and expressive drug synergy prediction.</description>
