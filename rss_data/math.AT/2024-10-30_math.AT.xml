      <title>Sectional number of a morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genus of a fibration was introduced by Schwarz in 1962. Given a continuous map $g:A\to B$, the usual sectional number $\text{sec}_u(g)$ is the least integer~$m$ such that $B$ can be covered by $m$ open subsets, each of which admits a local section of~$g$. Likewise, the sectional category $\text{secat}(g)$ is the least integer~$m$ such that $B$ can be covered by $m$ open subsets, each of which admits a local homotopy section of~$g$. In the case that $g$ is a fibration, the usual sectional number and the sectional category of $g$ coincide with the Schwarz's genus of $g$. In this paper, we introduce a notion of sectional number for a morphism in a category with covers, which extends the usual sectional number and sectional category (and, of course, Schwarz's notion). We study the invariance property, the behaviour under weak pullbacks and continuous functors, and present upper bounds in terms of a notion of LS category and projective covering number for an object. In addition, we introduce a notion of multiplicative cohomology theory on a category with covers, and we use it to present a cohomological lower bound for the sectional number. Several examples of this invariant are presented to support this theory. For instance, our sectional number yields a family of new numerical invariants in Top; we also express the twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture in terms of sectional numbers in the category of sets. Our unified concept is relevant in this new setting because it provides a foundation for sectional theory in category theory and builds bridges between new areas in mathematics.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>The connective KO-theory of the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z_2,2), I: the E_2 page</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $E_2$ page of the Adams spectral sequence converging to the connective KO-theory of the second mod 2 Eilenberg-MacLane space, $ko_*(K(Z/2,2))$. This required a careful analysis of the structure of $H^*(K(Z/2,2);Z_2)$ as a module over the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by $Sq^1$ and $Sq^2$. Complete analysis of the spectral sequence will be performed in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Derived $q$-Hodge complexes and refined $\operatorname{TC}^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a consequence of Efimov's proof of rigidity of the $\infty$-category of localising motives, Scholze and Efimov have constructed refinements of localising invariants such as $\operatorname{TC}^-$. In this article we compute the homotopy groups of the refined invariants $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{ku})$ and $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{KU})$. The computation involves a surprising connection to $q$-de Rham cohomology. In particular, it suggests a construction of a $q$-Hodge filtration on $q$-de Rham complexes in certain situations, which can be used to construct a functorial derived $q$-Hodge complex for many rings. This is in contrast to a no-go result by the second author, who showed that such a $q$-Hodge complex (and thus also a $q$-Hodge filtration) cannot exist in full generality.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for MCI Classification: A Comparative Analysis between Graph and Vietoris-Rips Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often linked to early neurodegeneration, is characterized by subtle cognitive declines and disruptions in brain connectivity. The present study offers a detailed analysis of topological changes associated with MCI, focusing on two subtypes: Early MCI and Late MCI. This analysis utilizes fMRI time series data from two distinct populations: the publicly available ADNI dataset (Western cohort) and the in-house TLSA dataset (Indian Urban cohort). Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis method, is employed with two distinct filtration techniques - Vietoris-Rips and graph filtration-for classifying MCI subtypes. For Vietoris-Rips filtration, inter-ROI Wasserstein distance matrices between persistent diagrams are used for classification, while graph filtration relies on the top ten most persistent homology features. Comparative analysis shows that the Vietoris-Rips filtration significantly outperforms graph filtration, capturing subtle variations in brain connectivity with greater accuracy. The Vietoris-Rips filtration method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 85.7\% for distinguishing between age and gender matched healthy controls and MCI, whereas graph filtration reached a maximum accuracy of 71.4\% for the same task. This superior performance highlights the sensitivity of Vietoris-Rips filtration in detecting intricate topological features associated with neurodegeneration. The findings underscore the potential of persistent homology, particularly when combined with the Wasserstein distance, as a powerful tool for early diagnosis and precise classification of cognitive impairments, offering valuable insights into brain connectivity changes in MCI.</description>

      <title>A twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for localising invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the classical Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the K-theory of (twisted) Laurent algebras to a splitting for general localising invariants of certain categories of twisted automorphisms. As an application, we obtain splitting formulas for Waldhausen's A-theory of mapping tori and for the K-theory of certain tensor algebras. We identify the Nil-terms appearing in this splitting in two ways. Firstly, as the reduced K-theory of twisted endomorphisms. Secondly, as the reduced K-theory of twisted nilpotent endomorphisms. Finally, we generalise classical vanishing results for Nil-terms of regular rings to our setting.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies &amp; bordism of non-supersymmetric strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions provide a handle on quantum gravity away from the supersymmetric lamppost. However, they have not been shown to be fully consistent; although local anomalies cancel due to versions of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, there could be global anomalies, not cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism, that could become fatal pathologies. We compute the twisted string bordism groups that control these anomalies via the Adams spectral sequence, showing that they vanish completely in two out of three cases (Sugimoto and $SO(16)^2$) and showing a partial vanishing also in the third (Sagnotti 0'B model). We also compute lower-dimensional bordism groups of the non-supersymmetric string theories, which are of interest to the classification of branes in these theories via the Cobordism Conjecture. We propose a worldvolume content based on anomaly inflow for the $SO(16)^2$ NS5-brane, and discuss subtleties related to the torsion part of the Bianchi identity. As a byproduct of our techniques and analysis, we also reprove that the outer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ automorphism swapping the two $E_8$ factors in the supersymmetric heterotic string is also non-anomalous.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of higher-categorical diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a book on higher-categorical diagrams, including pasting diagrams. It aims to provide a thorough and modern reference on the subject, collecting, revisiting and expanding results scattered across the literature, informed by recent advances and practical experience with higher-dimensional diagram rewriting.
  We approach the subject as a kind of directed combinatorial topology: a diagram is a map from a "directed cell complex", encoded combinatorially as a face poset together with orientation data. Unlike previous expositions, we adopt from the beginning a functorial viewpoint, focussing on morphisms and categorical constructions. We do not tie ourselves to a specific model of higher categories, and instead treat diagrams as independent combinatorial structures that admit functorial interpretations in various contexts.
  Topics covered include the theory of layerings of diagrams; acyclicity properties and their consequences; constructions including Gray products, suspensions, and joins; special shapes such as globes, oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes; the interpretation of diagrams in strict omega-categories and their geometric realisation as simplicial and CW complexes; and Steiner's theory of directed chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing unitary cohomology of low-rank integral special linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit finite-dimensional orthogonal representations $\pi_N$ of $\operatorname{SL}_{N}(\mathbb{Z})$ for $N \in \{3,4\}$ all of whose invariant vectors are trivial, and such that $H^{N - 1}(\operatorname{SL}_{N}(\mathbb{Z}),\pi_N)$ is non-trivial. This implies that for $N$ as above, the group $\operatorname{SL}_{N}(\mathbb{Z})$ does not have property $(T_{N-1})$ of Bader-Sauer and therefore is not $(N-1)$-Kazhdan in the sense of De Chiffre-Glebsky-Lubotzky-Thom, both being higher versions of Kazhdan's property $T$.</description>
