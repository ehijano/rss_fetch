      <title>Resonance of black hole quasinormal modes in coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) can exhibit resonant excitations associated with avoided crossings in their complex frequency spectrum. Such resonance phenomena can serve as novel signatures for probing new physics, where additional degrees of freedom are commonly introduced. Motivated by this possibility, we investigate QNMs in systems where multiple degrees of freedom are coupled with each other, and introduce a definition of excitation factors suitable for such systems. To demonstrate our formulation, we apply it to a black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory, where we find that avoided crossings can appear even between longest-lived modes originating from the fundamental modes of different degrees of freedom, in contrast to the Kerr case in General Relativity. We show that the excitation factors are indeed amplified as a manifestation of resonance at parameter values corresponding to the avoided crossings.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of perturbations in quasi-Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric deviations of quasinormal modes~(QNMs) is a common feature of beyond General Relativity (GR) theories. For theories with additional degrees of freedom, such as scalars and vectors, new family of modes might appear, usually called scalar-led and vector-led modes. Although a power series expansion in terms of the new parameters entering the potential is usually suitable to describe the frequency of the modes, the time-evolution of signals might present a richer structure, with different behavior in the tail, the presence of new modes (such as massive modes), or even instabilities. All these features are not explicitly exposed by a pure frequency domain analysis and might give hints of new physics. In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of signals considering potentials that slightly deviate from the ones coming from GR, looking into scalar, vector and metric perturbations. We focus on deviations that can be parametrized by a sum of $\sim 1/r^j$ terms in the effective potential, analyzing the effect of each term on the time domain profile.</description>

      <title>Do Black Holes With Generalized Entropy Violate Bekenstein Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general yes, but also not quite. It is known that if the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by some kind of generalized entropy, then the Bekenstein bound may be grossly violated. In this work, we show that this undesired violation can be avoided if we employ the equivalence between generalized entropy and varying-$G$ gravity (GEVAG). In this approach, modifying entropy necessarily also modifies gravity (as one should expect if gravity is indeed inherently tied to thermodynamics), which leads to an effective gravitational "constant" $G_\text{eff}$ that is area-dependent, and a thermodynamic energy that is distinct from the ADM mass. We show that a relaxed Bekenstein bound of the form $S \leqslant CRE$ is always satisfied, albeit the coefficient $C$ is no longer $2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories at different scales: averaging the scalar sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the averaging of a scalar degree of freedom that couples universally to matter. It quantifies the approximation of smoothing the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. In the case of Yukawa theories, which enjoy a linear Klein--Gordon equation, the averaging commutes with the field equation as one might expect. While all small-scale distributions of matter lead to field distributions with the same mean, the latter can have different energy densities and pressures when the Compton wavelength of the field is smaller than the smoothing scale. In the non-linear case, such as chameleon theories, this study quantifies the error made by averaging the matter distribution before solving the Klein--Gordon equation. While field fluctuations can become arbitrarily large when the matter source is screened, the commutativity property of linear theories is recovered in the unscreened regime. Implications for cosmology -- and in particular the equation of state in extended quintessence models -- and for laboratory experiments in low density medium are discussed. This analysis, although based on a simplifying description, sheds light on the effects of the small-scale distribution of matter as well as on the care required to define their equation of state and their cosmological signature.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamics of General Relativistic Binary-Single and Binary-Binary Encounters of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate the capability of the numerical-relativity code BAM to simulate fully relativistic black-hole binary-single and binary-binary encounters that result in flybys, delayed or accelerated eccentric mergers, exchanges, and other more complex dynamical interactions of initially non-spinning, equal-mass black holes. Our results show that we are able to simulate the time evolution of $N$ black holes in relativistic scattering scenarios, which exhibit interesting dynamics and gravitational-wave signals. The dynamics of these systems show noticeable differences compared to analogous systems in post-Newtonian approximations up to 2.5PN. A key result is that the gravitational waveforms exhibit remarkable features that could potentially make them distinguishable from regular binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in Horndeski gravity: a renormalized approach to effective gravitational coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a renormalized perturbation theory framework for nonlinear structure formation in a broad class of modified gravity models that exhibit Vainshtein screening, with a focus on a viable subclass of Horndeski theories. We extend earlier perturbative methods, originally applied to DGP model, to construct a self-consistent treatment that captures both the linear modifications to gravity at large scales and the nonlinear screening effects at small scales. In the framework, the response of the gravitational potential to matter density fluctuations is characterized by renormalized propagators, leading to the definition of a nonlinear (or renormalized) effective gravitational constant. The paper details several numerical strategies to compute this renormalized gravitational constant. Numerical examples illustrate how the effective gravitational constant evolves with scale and redshift. These results are key to accurately predicting cosmological observables such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum in modified gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Galactic Spacetime Solutions with a Varying Newton's Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a new family of galactic metrics corresponding to flat rotation curves at the outer radii. These are vacuum solutions to a gravity theory where the Newton's coupling varies mildly in space. The effective `mass', whose origin is purely geometric, receives a negative non-baryonic contribution. The angle of deflection of a light ray propagating in this geometry is found to be diminished rather than enhanced compared to the Einsteinian bending, the effect being highly suppressed though. Hence, these spacetimes are observationally dintinguishable from other geometric or `dark matter' based alternatives invoked to explain mass discrepancies in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the relativistic Lagrangian from the non-relativistic multiplicative Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian introduce an additional parameter that, despite its variation, results in identical equations of motion as those derived from the standard Lagrangian. This intriguing property becomes even more striking in the case of a free particle. By manipulating the parameter and integrating out, the statistical average of the multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian naturally arises. Astonishingly, from this statistical viewpoint, the relativistic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian emerge with remarkable elegance. On the action level, this formalism unveils a deeper connection: the spacetime of Einstein's theory reveals itself from a statistical perspective through the action associated with the multiplicative Lagrangian. This suggests that the multiplicative Lagrangian/Hamiltonian framework offers a profound and beautiful foundation, one that reveals the underlying unity between classical and relativistic descriptions in a way that transcends traditional formulations. In essence, the multiplicative approach introduces a richer and more intricate structure to our understanding of physics, bridging the gap between different theoretical realms through a statistical perspective.</description>

      <title>Master Functions of Reissner-Nordstrom Black Hole Perturbations and Their Darboux Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenzi and Sopuerta developed a new method to construct master functions for the perturbation of vacuum black holes. We extend this method to black holes coupled with electromagnetic field and cosmological constant by allowing the master functions to be linear combinations of the metric and electromagnetic-potential perturbations, as well as their first-order derivatives. Requiring these master functions satisfy wave equations with yet-to-be-determined effective potentials, we reduce the linearized Einstein-Maxwell system to a set of algebraic-differential constraints. Solving these constraints reveals four master function branches in each parity sector: two standard branches, which coincide with the Zerilli-Moncrief formalism, and two Darboux branches, characterized by their effective potentials. Within each parity sector, a Darboux transformation exists which connects the standard and Darboux branches, preserving the quasinormal mode spectrum and confirming their physical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>The relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

      <title>Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame, revealing a breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling a non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial components of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and clipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill the equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that this defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum conservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and flat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the drawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero the local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its presence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as a central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.</description>

      <title>Cosmology inside a black hole: adding matter on the brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16997v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braneworlds inside an AdS black hole provide simple models where a closed cosmology can be encoded in a dual field theory. Previous studies have focused on pure-tension branes, where the only matter in the cosmology is that dual to the holographic bulk. We consider models with additional explicit matter fields on the brane. Both for perfect fluid matter and for an axion field on the brane, we show that this can avoid a self-intersection problem in the Euclidean construction of such geometries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring amplitude criteria for weak gravity in electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between weak gravity conjecture (WGC) bounds and scattering positivity have been extensively studied over the past decade. This work further explores these connections by proposing positivity as a potential amplitude criterion for weak gravity, with the aim of unifying various weak gravity bounds within a single framework. We illustrate this criterion by analyzing two-body elastic scatterings of photons and Higgs bosons in the forward limit of an electroweak (EW)-like theory. This leads to an amplitude-based criterion that extends magnetic WGC-type bounds to include not only the Abelian gauge coupling but also the non-Abelian gauge and the Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, a version of the species bound naturally emerges within this setup, suggesting that this amplitude criterion may extend to broader Swampland conjectures beyond the WGC.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 2.5$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>A new framework for classical double copies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy relates gauge and gravitational theories, with widespread application to quantum scattering amplitudes and classical perturbative results. It also connects exact classical solutions of abelian gauge and gravitational theories in a small number of specific examples, known as classical double copies. These have a number of special properties, such as being algebraically special. It remains an open question if classical doubles copies exist for algebraically general spacetimes, or those which possess nontrivial dynamics. Here we provide a novel framework for understanding classical double copies at the level of the metric, both organizing the known examples and exploring their properties under a new lens. Utilizing Killing vectors as natural gauge fields on a spacetime, we propose a procedure for generating new classical double copies. As a proof of concept, we provide a flat space single copy for the Kasner metric, an algebraically general spacetime. This example is also a double copy at the level of its curvature, and provides the first type I Weyl double copy, confirming expectations from perturbation theory. This provides a promising avenue for extending exact double copies to a broader class of general, physically relevant spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>In search of an interaction in the dark sector through Gaussian Process and ANN approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$) or phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.</description>

      <title>Warming up the Fibres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2]. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L.
  In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the Black String is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric.
  Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness, i.e. there exist no other Ricci-flat metrics near the Black String, and we give bounds for the size of the neighborhood in which the Black String is unique.
  We compare this with the toy problem of a scalar field satisfying an elliptic equation that was already solved in arXiv:2410.20967 using different methods.
  In this case we can use the fixed point theorem method to prove not just a local but a global statement.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this issue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars to FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend sensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\odot$ star, the deviation is up to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The deviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that the universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for boson particle mass $m_b \geq 26.8\times10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV}$. This effectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it becomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the I-Love-Q relation violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a topological quantum field theory phase for four-dimensional gravity. We show it is able to generate, not only General Relativity, but the whole family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity. This is accomplished due to the existence of a topological symmetry which, when explicitly broken via the introduction of a mass scale, releases the local degrees of freedom of gravity. Additionally, we introduce an extended notion of the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge conditions to evaluate the Ward identities, counterterms, and prove the quantum stability of the model, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the algebraic renormalization technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field equations of general relativity can be derived from the Einstein action, which is quadratic in connection coefficients, rather than the standard action involving the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and counterterm. We show that it is possible to construct a new counterterm directly for the Einstein action, which removes divergences and naturally introduces a flat reference spacetime. The total action is then covariant under simultaneous transformation of both the spacetime and reference tetrads, and argue that this is analogous to the Gibbons-Hawking action. We then explore different perspectives arising naturally from different uses of the reference tetrad, and explore implications of viewing gravity as fundamentally described in terms of non-covariant connection coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial isocurvature perturbations, which can arise from various sources in the early Universe, have the potential to leave observable imprints on the gravitational-wave background and provide insights into the nature of primordial fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the gauge dependence of induced gravitational waves (IGWs) sourced by these isocurvature perturbations during radiation dominated era and the kination period in the early universe. We analyze the energy density spectra of IGWs in three different gauges: synchronous, Newtonian, and uniform curvature gauges. To facilitate this analysis, we derive analytical solutions for the perturbations that contribute to the IGW spectra and a general gauge transformation from Newtonian gauge to an arbitrary gauge. Our results reveal significant differences in the energy spectra across these gauges. We find that the energy density of IGWs during radiation domination increases with conformal time as $\eta^8$ and $\eta^4$ for synchronous and uniform curvature gauges, respectively, while it converges in the Newtonian gauge. These findings highlight the importance of gauge choice in calculating IGWs and have implications for the interpretation of future observations of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Schwarzschild-Melvin solution within Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories to include non-null scalar charges, while remaining embedded in a magnetic or electric field \textit{\`a la Melvin}. We then use this general solution to obtain the solution in the specific case of Entangled Relativity after a conformal transformation. This notably enables us to verify that the analytical solution used in [Arruga \&amp; Minazzoli 2021] in order to represent compact objects such as neutron stars in Entangled Relativity is indeed a good approximation of the exact solutions of Entangled Relativity when the background field goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Overtones behavior of higher dimensional black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, proposed by Boulware and Deser, have been extensively studied in numerous works, primarily focusing on the fundamental mode. These studies have shown that for sufficiently small black holes, comparing to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter, a dynamical instability arises. In this work, for the first time, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of overtones. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode remains largely unchanged due to the limited stability region, the first few overtones deviate from their Tangherlini limits at an increasing rate. This deviation reflects the impact of the coupling parameter on the near-horizon structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants and Large Gauge Effects in Flat and AdS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can, in principle, be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry, and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum, etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under consideration. This becomes quite important, especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor, will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole. We lift this construction to the cosmological event horizon of an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <title>Light trajectories and wave dynamics in optical wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \(\rho = 0\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \(\rho\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\(m\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \(m\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \(m \neq 0\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine time-delayed differential equations, discussing first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We derive their characteristic equations and solve them using the Laplace transform. We derive a modified evolution equation for the Hubble parameter incorporating a viscosity term modeled as a function of the delayed Hubble parameter within Eckart's theory. We extend this equation using the last-step method of fractional calculus, resulting in Caputo's time-delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations.</description>

      <title>Corrections of the GR eikonal limit by a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ is studied in the eikonal limit, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, studied in [1]-[6]. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears enhanced. However, for these new models, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, as the introduction of new scales may change the allowed center of mass and impulse transfer scales. This issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work however should be taken with care, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. The results presented here, in our opinion, are in agreement with the suppression of corrections pointed out \cite{brandhuber}, \cite{fradkin} and \cite{deser} in for the Stelle gravity. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, this order generically is non vanishing. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Time in Topological Quantum Gravity of the Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly "shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.</description>

      <title>An interference-based method for the detection of strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strongly lensed gravitational wave (SLGW) is a promising transient phenomenon. However, the long-wave nature of gravitational waves poses a significant challenge in identification of its host galaxy. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method triggered by the wave optics effect of microlensing. The microlensing interference introduce frequency-dependent fluctuations in the waveform. Our method consists of three steps. First, we reconstruct the waveforms by using the template-independent and template-dependent methods. The mismatch of two reconstructions serves as an indicator of SLGWs. This step can identify approximately $10\%$ SLGWs. Second, we pair the SLGWs' multiple-images by employing the sky localization overlapping. Because we have pre-identified at least one image through microlensing, the false alarm probability for pairing SLGWs is significantly reduced. Third, we search the host galaxy by requiring the consistency of time-delays between galaxy-galaxy lensing and SLGW. By combing the stage-IV galaxy survey and the third-generation gravitational wave detectors, we expect to find, on average, 1 quadruple-image system per 3 years. The merit of this method can significantly facilitate the pursuit of time-delay cosmography, discovery of compact objects and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from primordial first-order phase transitions are a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. They represent one of the best prospects for observing or constraining new physics with the LISA gravitational wave observatory. However, the large foreground population of galactic binaries in the same frequency range represents a challenge, and will hinder the recovery of a stochastic background. To test the recoverability of a stochastic gravitational wave background, we use the LISA Simulation Suite to generate data incorporating both a stochastic background and an annually modulated foreground modelling the galactic binary population, and the Bayesian analysis code Cobaya to attempt to recover the model parameters. By applying the Deviance Information Criterion to compare models with and without a stochastic background we place bounds on the detectability of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions. By further comparing models with and without the annual modulation, we show that exploiting the modulation improves the goodness-of-fit and gives a modest improvement to the bounds on detectable models.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Population Constraints with TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a massive black hole and a stellar compact object, are one of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Their population study can be used to constrain astrophysical models that interpret the EMRI formation mechanisms. In this paper, as an initial attempt, we employ a parametrization method to describe the EMRI population model in the loss cone formation channel. This approach, however, can be extended to other models such as the accretion disc driven formation channel. We present the phenomenological characteristic of the MBH mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Then, we investigate the posterior distribution of the hyper-parameters that describe this population model. The optimistic results show that TianQin could recover almost all the posterior of the hyper-parameters within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. The hyper-parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, b$, which describe the MBH mass distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $46.4\%$, $12.6\%$, and $3\%$, respectively. The hyper-parameters $\mu_z$, and $\sigma_z$, which describe the redshift distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $15.4\%$ and $21.1\%$. With this estimation accuracy, the EMRI population characteristics can be effectively demonstrated, potentially serving as evidence for EMRI formation in the future studies. Furthermore, with an increasing number of detectable events, the parameter estimation for the hyper-parameters will improve and the confidence intervals will be narrowed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted by the linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter by assuming that it satisfies a law of motion described by an autonomous second-order differential equation, with the limit of the cosmological constant as an equilibrium point. We determine the asymptotic solutions of this equation and use them to construct two families of parametric dark energy models, employing both linear and logarithmic parametrization with respect to the scale factor. We perform observational constraints by using the Supernova, the Cosmic Chronometers and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations of DESI DR2. The constraint parameters are directly related with the initial value problem for the law of motion and its algebraic properties. The analysis shows that most of the models fit the observational data well with a preference to the models of the logarithmic parametrization. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of models as generalizations of the CPL model, for which the equilibrium point is a constant value rather than the cosmological constant. These models fit the data in a similar or better way to the CPL and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>
