      <title>A relativistic coupled-cluster treatment of magnetic hyperfine structure of the $X^2\Pi$ and $A^2\Sigma^+$ states of OH isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Ab initio}$ calculations of the parallel component of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant have been carried out for hydroxyl radical isotopologues ($^{16,17}$OH(D)) over the internuclear distance range $R \in [0.6, 1.8]$ \r{A}. For the ground electronic state $X^2\Pi$, the HFS functions were evaluated for contributions induced by both oxygen and hydrogen nuclei. In addition, the hydrogen-induced HFS curve was calculated for the excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ state. The quantum-chemistry study employs a four-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations up to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes was studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative calculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions represent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date exhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced HFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational levels ($v\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged $\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within $1\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range over which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous studies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of higher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and non-adiabatic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Numerically exact quantum dynamics with tensor networks: Predicting the decoherence of interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the quantum dynamics of promising solid-state and molecular quantum technology candidates remains a formidable challenge. Yet, accessing these dynamics is key to understanding and controlling decoherence mechanisms -- a prerequisite for designing better qubits, sensors, and memories. We leverage a matrix product state representation to introduce a numerically exact and scalable method to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments. Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.</description>

      <title>MLIP Arena: Advancing Fairness and Transparency in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials via an Open, Accessible Benchmark Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular and materials modeling, but existing benchmarks suffer from data leakage, limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at https://github.com/atomind-ai/mlip-arena.</description>

      <title>MolCluster: Integrating Graph Neural Network with Community Detection for Coarse-Grained Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling simplifies molecular systems by mapping groups of atoms into representative units. However, traditional CG approaches rely on fixed mapping rules, which limit their ability to handle diverse chemical systems and require extensive manual intervention. Thus, supervised learning-based CG methods have been proposed, enabling more automated and adaptable mapping. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from limited labeled datasets and the inability to control mapping resolution, which is essential for multiscale modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose MolCluster, an unsupervised model that integrates a graph neural network and a community detection algorithm to extract CG representations. Additionally, a predefined group pair loss ensures the preservation of target groups, and a bisection strategy enables precise, customizable resolution across different molecular systems. In the case of the downstream task, evaluations on the MARTINI2 dataset demonstrate that MolCluster, benefiting from its label-free pretraining strategy, outperforms both traditional clustering and supervised models. Overall, these results highlight the potential of MolCluster as a core model for customizable and chemically consistent CG mapping.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoabsorption Spectra of Icy Isoprene and its Oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and $\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.</description>

      <title>Text-Augmented Multimodal LLMs for Chemical Reaction Condition Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying reaction conditions that are broadly applicable across diverse substrates is a longstanding challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical research. While many methods are available to generate conditions with acceptable performance, a universal approach for reliably discovering effective conditions during reaction exploration is rare. Consequently, current reaction optimization processes are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, relying heavily on trial-and-error experimentation. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design and chemical reasoning tasks. Here, we report the design, implementation and application of Chemma-RC, a text-augmented multimodal LLM to identify effective conditions through task-specific dialogue and condition generation. Chemma-RC learns a unified representation of chemical reactions by aligning multiple modalities-including text corpus, reaction SMILES, and reaction graphs-within a shared embedding module. Performance benchmarking on datasets showed high precision in identifying optimal conditions, with up to 17% improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction was investigated experimentally to evaluate the functionalities of the Chemma-RC in practice. Our findings suggest that Chemma-RC holds significant potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Beyond asymptotic reasoning: the practicalities of a quantum ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approachs. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</description>
