      <title>Recent open heavy flavor studies for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate a series of high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($\textit{e + A}$) collisions to study several fundamental questions in the high energy and nuclear physics field. Heavy flavor hadron and jet production at the EIC plays an important role in exploring both potential modification on the initial-state nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and final-state parton propagation and hadronization processes under different nuclear medium conditions. The current design of the EIC ePIC detector has good performance of vertex and track reconstruction, particle identification and energy determination in the pseudorapidity region of $-3.5&lt;\eta&lt;3.5$, which will enable a series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements. Latest simulation studies of the projected nuclear modification factor $R_{eA}$ of heavy flavor jets and heavy flavor hadron inside jets in $e+p$ and $\textit{e + Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 28.6 GeV and 63.2 GeV as well as the projected statistical accuracy of inclusive and differential charm baryon over meson ratio measurements in $e+p$ collisions will be presented. The impacts of these proposed EIC measurements on constraining the heavy quark propagation properties in cold nuclear medium and exploring the heavy quark hadronization process will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos in IceCube and KM3NeT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino observatories such as IceCube, Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), and Super-Kamiokande cover a broad energy range that enables the study of both atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos. IceCube and KM3NeT focus on a similar energy range, from a few GeV to PeV, and have conducted competitive work on the atmospheric neutrino flux, three-flavor oscillation parameter measurements, searches beyond the Standard Model, and investigations of cosmic-ray accelerators using high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. Recent IceCube findings of evidence of neutrino signals from NGC~1068 have triggered a series of follow-up studies. These studies provide evidence that a subset of Seyfert galaxies may produce high-energy neutrinos. The emerging candidates are NGC~4151, NGC~3079, CGCG~420-015, and Circinus Galaxy. Furthermore, a stacking analysis of 13 selected sources in the Southern Hemisphere reported a cumulative neutrino signal at 3.0\,$\sigma$, offering independent evidence that some X-ray-bright Seyfert galaxies could be potential high-energy neutrino sources. KM3NeT, still under construction, continues to accumulate data that will support future studies of astrophysical neutrino sources. However, with its currently deployed detection units, it has detected an ultra-high-energy event of several tens of PeV originating from approximately 1 degree above the horizon. This contribution highlights and summarizes recent findings from IceCube and KM3NeT in both neutrino physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>RIO EPICS device support application case study on an ion source control system (ISHP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is a software tool that during last years has become relevant as a main framework to deploy distributed control systems in large scientific environments. At the moment, ESS Bilbao uses this middleware to perform the control of their Ion Source Hydrogen Positive (ISHP) project. The implementation of the control system was based on: PXI Real Time controllers using the LabVIEW-RT and LabVIEW-EPICS tools; and RIO devices based on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Intended to provide a full compliant EPICS IOCs for RIO devices and to avoid additional efforts on the system maintainability, a migration of the current system to a derivative Red Hat Linux (CentOS) environment has been conducted. This paper presents a real application case study for using the NIRIO EPICS device support (NIRIO-EDS) to give support to the ISHP. Although RIO FPGA configurations are particular solutions for ISHP performance, the NIRIO-EDS has permitted the control and monitoring of devices by applying a well-defined design methodology into the previous FPGA configuration for RIO/FlexRIO devices. This methodology has permitted a fast and easy deployment for the new robust, scalable and maintainable software to support RIO devices into the ISHP control architecture.</description>

      <title>Reactor antineutrinos CE$\nu$NS on germanium: CONUS+ and TEXONO as a new gateway to SM and BSM physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties. Following its first detection by the COHERENT collaboration, recent reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle, neutrino electromagnetic properties - including charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment - as well as non-standard interactions and light mediators. We also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are influential machine learning models that have gained prominence across various research fields, including high-energy physics (HEP) simulations. Among them, Conditional GANs (CGANs) offer a unique advantage by conditioning on specific parameters, making them particularly well-suited for meson studies. Given the limited size of the available meson dataset$ - $based on the quark content, quantum numbers, mass, and width$ - $this study, for the first time, applies the CGAN framework to augment the dataset of mesons, while preserving the inherent characteristics of the original data. Using this enhanced dataset, we employ the CGAN model to estimate the mass and width of both ordinary and exotic mesons, based solely on their quark content and quantum numbers. Our CGAN$ - $based predictions highlight the framework's potential as a reliable tool for meson property estimation, providing valuable insights for future research in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Search for charged-lepton flavor violation in the production and decay of top quarks using trilepton final states in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is performed for charged-lepton flavor violating processes in top quark (t) production and decay. The data were collected by the CMS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The selected events are required to contain one opposite-sign electron-muon pair, a third charged lepton (electron or muon), and at least one jet of which no more than one is associated with a bottom quark. Boosted decision trees are used to distinguish signal from background, exploiting differences in the kinematics of the final states particles. The data are consistent with the standard model expectation. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed in the context of effective field theory on the Wilson coefficients, which range between 0.024-0.424 TeV$^{-2}$ depending on the flavor of the associated light quark and the Lorentz structure of the interaction. These limits are converted to upper limits on branching fractions involving up (charm) quarks, t $\to$ e$\mu$u (t $\to$ e$\mu$c), of 0.032 (0.498) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, 0.022 (0.369) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, and 0.012 (0.216) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ for tensor-like, vector-like, and scalar-like interactions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Flavor Tagger and measurement of $\mathrm{sin}2\beta$ at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GFlaT, a new algorithm that uses a graph-neural-network to determine the flavor of neutral B mesons produced in $\mathrm{\Upsilon(4S)}$ decays. We evaluate its performance using $B$ decays to flavor-specific hadronic final states reconstructed in a $362$ $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ sample of electron-positron collisions recorded at the $\mathrm{\Upsilon(4S)}$ resonance with the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB collider. We achieve an effective tagging efficiency of $(37.40 \pm 0.43 \pm 0.36) \%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic, which is $18\%$ better than the previous Belle II algorithm. Demonstrating the algorithm, we use $B^0 \to J/\psi K_\mathrm{S}^0$ decays to measure the direct and mixing-induced CP violation parameters, $C = (-0.035 \pm 0.026 \pm 0.013)$ and $S = (0.724 \pm 0.035 \pm 0.014)$, from which we obtain $\beta = (23.2 \pm 1.5 \pm 0.6)^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>A panorama of new-physics explanations to the MiniBooNE excess</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MiniBooNE low-energy excess stands as an unexplained anomaly in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. It has been shown that it can be explained in the context of dark sector models. Here, we provide an overview of the possible new-physics solutions based on electron, photon, and dilepton final states. We systematically discuss the various production mechanisms for dark particles in neutrino-nucleus scattering. Our main result is a comprehensive fit to the MiniBooNE energy spectrum in the parameter space of dark neutrino models, where short-lived heavy neutral leptons are produced in neutrino interactions and decay to $e^+e^-$ pairs inside the detector. For the first time, other experiments will be able to directly confirm or rule out dark neutrino interpretations of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess.</description>

      <title>Measurement of in-medium jet modification using direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from energetic direct-photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral-pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in p+p and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ GeV over a broad kinematic range, for jet resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. Medium-induced jet yield suppression is observed to be larger for $R$=0.2 than for 0.5, reflecting the angular range of jet energy redistribution due to quenching. The predictions of model calculations incorporating jet quenching are not fully consistent with the observations. These results provide new insight into the physical origins of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models for fast and high-fidelity whole-event simulation in high-energy heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, and normalizing flows, have been widely used and studied as efficient alternatives for traditional scientific simulations. However, they have several drawbacks, including training instability and inability to cover the entire data distribution, especially for regions where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event, full-detector simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact with the detector. This work investigates the effectiveness of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for the sPHENIX experiment that includes the heavy-ion event generation and response of the entire calorimeter stack. DDPM performance in sPHENIX simulation data is compared with a popular rival, GANs. Results show that both DDPMs and GANs can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low-to-medium calorimeter energies). Nonetheless, DDPMs significantly outperform GANs, especially in high-energy regions where data are rare. Additionally, DDPMs exhibit superior stability compared to GANs. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy-ion collision events. Moreover, DDPMs offer a substantial speedup of approximately a factor of 100 compared to the traditional Geant4 simulation method.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions from COHERENT, PandaX-4T and XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the effective field theory framework, using data from the first measurement of solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) in the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments and data from the COHERENT experiment. The impacts of neutrino NSIs on the CE$\nu$NS cross section and the matter effect in the propagation of solar neutrinos are included, while we obtain that the expected number of CE$\nu$NS events is more sensitive to neutrino NSIs appearing in the cross section. Due to relatively large statistical uncertainties, the sensitivities of the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments to the neutrino NSIs are currently limited, compared to the COHERENT experiment. Besides, we find that since the central value of the measured CE$\nu$NS counts significantly differs from the Standard Model prediction, the sensitivity of PandaX-4T experiment is even more restricted compared to XENONnT. However, the measurements of PandaX-4T and XENONnT are uniquely sensitive to the neutrino NSIs for the $\tau$ flavor due to oscillation feature of the solar $^8$B neutrinos. We also assess how the experimental central value, exposure, and systematic uncertainties will affect the constraints on neutrino NSIs from various CE$\nu$NS measurements in the future.</description>

Abstract: The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will utilize high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($e+A$) collisions to solve several fundamental questions including searching for gluon saturation and studying the proton/nuclear structure. Complementary to the ongoing EIC project detector technical prototype carried out by the ePIC collaboration, a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (i.e., MALTA2) based fast timing silicon tracking detector (FMT) has been proposed to provide additional hits for track reconstruction in the forward and backward region at the EIC to improve the overall track reconstruction quality. The fast timing resolution of the MALTA2 technology will help reject background events at the EIC as well. Progress of latest MALTA2 R$\&amp;$D, the development of a new MALTA2 quad-sensor prototype module and impacts of the proposed FMT in EIC physics studies will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Light scalar beyond the Higgs mixing limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the interactions of a light scalar singlet, which mixes with the Standard Model~(SM) Higgs, also receive other UV contributions of comparable size. We focus, in particular, on the flavor aligned limit, where couplings of the light scalar to the SM are almost flavor diagonal, but not necessarily proportional to the Higgs Yukawa couplings. The phenomenology of such a general flavor aligned light scalar differs from both the Higgs-mixed scalar, as well as from a general axion-like particle. We explore this for light scalar masses below a few hundred MeV, such that they can be produced in kaon decays, and in decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, and the transitions described using chiral perturbation theory. We then derive constraints on the light scalar interactions, assuming that light scalar decays are either just into photons or are invisible. We also discuss several UV examples of such light scalar models: a two-Higgs doublet model extended by a light scalar, a light dilaton from the dark sector, and a SM extended by heavy vector-like quarks and a light scalar. For the latter we also performed matching onto low energy theory at one-loop.</description>
