      <title>Relating Apartness and Branching Bisimulation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geuvers and Jacobs (LMCS 2021) formulated the notion of apartness relation on state-based systems modelled as coalgebras. In this context apartness is formally dual to bisimilarity, and gives an explicit proof system for showing that certain states are not bisimilar. In the current paper, we relate apartness to another classical element of the theory of behavioural equivalences: that of turn-based two-player games. Studying both strong and branching bisimilarity, we show that winning configurations for the Spoiler player correspond to apartness proofs, for transition systems that are image-finite (in the case of strong bisimilarity) and finite (in the case of branching bisimilarity).</description>

      <title>Conformance Games for Graded Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic characterizations of process equivalences traditionally form a central topic in concurrency; for example, most equivalences on the classical linear-time / branching-time spectrum come with such characterizations. Recent work on so-called graded semantics has led to a generic behavioural equivalence game that covers the mentioned games on the linear-time~/ branching-time spectrum and moreover applies in coalgebraic generality, and thus instantiates also to equivalence games on systems with non-relational branching type (probabilistic, weighted, game-based etc.). In the present work, we generalize this approach to cover other types of process comparison beyond equivalence, such as behavioural preorders or pseudometrics. At the most general level, we abstract such notions of behavoiural conformance in terms of topological categories, and later specialize to conformances presented as relational structures to obtain a concrete syntax. We obtain a sound and complete generic game for behavioural conformances in this sense. We present a number of instantiations, obtaining game characterizations of, e.g., trace inclusion, probabilistic trace distance, bisimulation topologies, and simulation distances on metric labelled transition systems.</description>

      <title>Formal Logic-guided Robust Federated Learning against Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27\% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.

      <title>Designing Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Social Welfare and Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In game theory, mechanism design is concerned with the design of incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</description>

      <title>The Vanilla Sequent Calculus is Call-by-Value (Fresh Perspective)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Curry-Howard interpretations of call-by-value evaluation for the $\lambda$-calculus are either based on ad-hoc modifications of intuitionistic proof systems or involve additional logical concepts such as classical logic or linear logic, despite the fact that call-by-value was introduced in an intuitionistic setting without linear features.
  This paper shows that the most basic sequent calculus for minimal intuitionistic logic -- dubbed here vanilla -- can naturally be seen as a logical interpretation of call-by-value evaluation. This is obtained by establishing mutual simulations with a well-known formalism for call-by-value evaluation.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{\'{a}}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces.
  We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning Formal Mathematics From Intrinsic Motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How did humanity coax mathematics from the aether? We explore the Platonic view that mathematics can be discovered from its axioms - a game of conjecture and proof. We describe Minimo (Mathematics from Intrinsic Motivation): an agent that jointly learns to pose challenging problems for itself (conjecturing) and solve them (theorem proving). Given a mathematical domain axiomatized in dependent type theory, we first combine methods for constrained decoding and type-directed synthesis to sample valid conjectures from a language model. Our method guarantees well-formed conjectures by construction, even as we start with a randomly initialized model. We use the same model to represent a policy and value function for guiding proof search. Our agent targets generating hard but provable conjectures - a moving target, since its own theorem proving ability also improves as it trains. We propose novel methods for hindsight relabeling on proof search trees to significantly improve the agent's sample efficiency in both tasks. Experiments on 3 axiomatic domains (propositional logic, arithmetic and group theory) demonstrate that our agent can bootstrap from only the axioms, self-improving in generating true and challenging conjectures and in finding proofs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Generate Verifiable Specifications in VeriFast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static verification is a powerful method for enhancing software quality, but it demands significant human labor and resources. This is particularly true of static verifiers that reason about heap manipulating programs using an ownership logic. LLMs have shown promise in a number of software engineering activities, including code generation, test generation, proof generation for theorem provers, and specification generation for static verifiers. However, prior work has not explored how well LLMs can perform specification generation for specifications based in an ownership logic, such as separation logic.
  To address this gap, this paper explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT models, in generating fully correct specifications based on separation logic for static verification of human-written programs in VeriFast. Our first experiment employed traditional prompt engineering and the second used Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting to identify and address common errors generated across the GPT models. The results indicate that GPT models can successfully generate specifications for verifying heap manipulating code with VeriFast. Furthermore, while CoT prompting significantly reduces syntax errors generated by the GPT models, it does not greatly improve verification error rates compared to prompt engineering.</description>
