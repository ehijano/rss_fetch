      <title>Discretization anisotropy in micromagnetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite difference based micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for the computational investigation of magnetic structures. In this paper, we demonstrate how the discretization of continuous micromagnetic equations introduces a numerical 'discretization anisotropy'. We demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, this anisotropy operates on an energy scale comparable to that of intrinsic physical phenomena. Furthermore, we illustrate that selecting appropriate finite difference stencils and minimizing the size of the discretization cells are effective strategies to mitigate discretization anisotropy.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 13 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>Vacancy and Antisite-Induced Ferromagnetism in Liquid-Phase Exfoliated Bi$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth Telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) is a widely studied topological insulator, recognized for its unique surface states, low electronic bandgap, and low thermal conductivity. In this study, we characterize exfoliated Bi$_2$Te$_3$ dispersions produced via solvothermal intercalation, where ferromagnetism was measured at room temperature. DFT simulations show that this ferromagnetic behavior is attributed to the presence of vacancies and antisites in both the bulk material and the exfoliated crystals. Additionally, the DFT results were complemented by experimental measurements of the optical bandgap using UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing a broadening of the bandgap as the material becomes thinner.</description>

      <title>rt-TDDFT modeling of thermal emission by laser-heated glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the laser processing of glass, a ~50-1000 $\mu$m-thick layer of glass is heated to a high temperature by the laser beam. Due to the shallow depth of this hot layer, the infrared emission and absorption spectra may deviate from the black-body spectra and can be influenced by the vibrational structure of the material. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) modeling of the thermal radiation by such hot layers allows us to calculate the emissivity and thus to evaluate the reliability of the measurements conducted with thermal cameras at specific wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Domain-Pair Intertwined Topological Domain Structure in Elemental Bi Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain structures, separated by domain walls, often display unconventional physics and hold significant potential for applications in nano-devices. Most naturally growth domain walls are charge-neutral to avoid increased electrostatic energy, while the intrinsically stable charged 180{\deg} domain walls in Bi monolayer challenged this conventional knowledge and emerged an unexplored field. Here, using machine-learning potential and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated the finite-temperature dynamics of domain walls and discovered a domain-pair intertwined topological domain structure in Bi monolayer. In 180{\deg} domain walls, a unique polarization switching mechanism is observed, characterized by the out-of-plane shuffle of Bi atoms without bond breaking. This shuffle mechanism reverses the charge properties of Bi atoms, transforming Bi anions into cations and vice versa, ultimately reversing the polarization. Then, we observed a topological multi-domain structure with two groups of domain pairs intertwined. The charged 180{\deg} domain walls form local domain pairs, with the 90{\deg} domain walls emerge between different domain pairs. This multi-domain maintains a stable topological structure within the strain range ({\epsilon}_x = 0 to 4.70%) and exhibits rich domain wall reactions under further applied strain. Our findings provide insights into the charged 180{\deg} domain walls and the related topological domain structures, enabling new opportunities for applications in electronic and nano-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Understanding the role of defects in the lattice transport properties of half-Heusler compounds: a machine learning analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the effect of intrinsic defects on the electronic properties of half-Heusler compounds has been extensively discussed in literature, their effect on the lattice vibrations has received much less attention, due to the prohibitive computational demands. This may lead to an erroneous description of the lattice thermal conductivity, which plays a crucial role in the thermoelectric efficiency, and for which there exists a significant discrepancy between ideal theoretical values and available experimental measurements. In this article, we employ a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to investigate how intrinsic defects affect the phonon spectra and lattice thermal conductivity of TaFeSb, alongside its electronic structure. The calculation of the formation energies of various defects identifies Fe interstitial atoms sitting at the vacant side of the HH crystal structure as the most likely to form, immediately followed by Sb substitution at Ta sites and by other antisite configurations. Phonon calculations illustrate that both defects generate localized phonon modes that significantly lower the lattice thermal conductivity, especially around room temperature. This reduction aligns the calculated values with available measurements, underscoring the critical role of intrinsic defects in reconciling the existing discrepancies between theory and experiment. Our findings also reveal that these defects introduce localized electronic states, effectively reducing the theoretical electronic band gap and bringing it closer to the experimentally observed values. Finally, our analysis demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of machine-learning-based approaches to investigate defect-induced properties in complex materials for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of half-metallic ferromagnetism and valley polarization in transition metal substituted WSTe monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials hold a great importance in spintronic and valleytronic applications due to their unique lattice structures and emergent properties. They intrinsically exhibit both an in-plane inversion and out-of-plane mirror symmetry breakings, which offer a new degree of freedom to electrons in the material. One of the main limitations in the multifunctional applications of these materials is, however, that, they are usually non-magnetic in nature. Here, using first-principles calculations, we propose to induce magnetic degree of freedom in non-magnetic WSTe via doping with transition metal (TM) elements -- Fe, Mn and Co. Further, we comprehensively probe the electronic, spintronic and valleytronic properties in these systems. Our simulations predict intrinsic Rashba and Zeeman-type spin splitting in pristine WSTe. The obtained Rashba parameter is $\sim$ 422 meV\AA\; along the $\Gamma - K$ direction. Our study shows a strong dependence on uniaxial and biaxial strains where we observe an enhancement of $\sim$ 2.1\% with 3\% biaxial compressive strain. The electronic structure of TM-substituted WSTe reveals half-metallic nature for 6.25 and 18.75\% of Fe, 25\% of Mn, and 18.75 and 25\% of Co structures, which leads to 100\% spin polarization. The obtained values of valley polarization 65, 54.4 and 46.3 meV for 6.25\% of Fe, Mn and Co, respectively, are consistent with the literature data for other Janus materials. Further, our calculations show a strain dependent tunability of valley polarization, where we find an increasing (decreasing) trend with uniaxial and biaxial tensile (compressive) strains. We observed a maximum enhancement of $\sim$ 1.72\% for 6.25\% of Fe on application of 3\% biaxial tensile strain.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Colloidal Nanocrystal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals usually includes complex chemical reactions and multi-step crystallization processes. Despite the great success in the past 30 years, it remains challenging to clarify the correlations between synthetic parameters of chemical reaction and physical properties of nanocrystals. Here, we developed a deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model that correlates synthetic parameters with the final size and shape of target nanocrystals, using a dataset of 3500 recipes covering 348 distinct nanocrystal compositions. The size and shape labels were obtained from transmission electron microscope images using a segmentation model trained with a semi-supervised algorithm on a dataset comprising 1.2 million nanocrystals. By applying the reaction intermediate-based data augmentation method and elaborated descriptors, the synthesis model was able to predict nanocrystal's size with a mean absolute error of 1.39 nm, while reaching an 89% average accuracy for shape classification. The synthesis model shows knowledge transfer capabilities across different nanocrystals with inputs of new recipes. With that, the influence of chemicals on the final size of nanocrystals was further evaluated, revealing the importance order of nanocrystal composition, precursor or ligand, and solvent. Overall, the deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model offers a powerful tool to expedite the development of high-quality nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of the dissipation of surface acoustic waves by ferromagnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry of the coupling between surface acoustic waves and ferromagnetic resonance in a thin magnetic film of CoFeB deposited on top of a piezoelectric Z-cut LiNbO3 substrate. We vary the orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the wavevector of the surface acoustic wave. Experiments indicate an unexpected 2-fold symmetry of the absorption of the SAW energy by the magnetic film. We discuss whether this symmetry can arise from the magnetoelastic torque of the longitudinal strain and the magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic resonance. We find that one origin of the 2-fold symmetry can be the weak in-plane uniaxial anisotropy present within the magnetic film. This phenomena adds to the previously identified other source of 2-fold symmetry but shall persist for ultrathin films when the dipolar interactions cease to contribute to the anisotropy of the slope of the spin wave dispersion relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct a Wannier tight-binding model for TaS$_2$ under a superlattice potential modulation, based on the Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations database established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, so as to study the electronic properties of the structure. Our computational method enables direct calculation of the energy bands from the Hamiltonian without any additional assumptions. We observed a pair of dispersionless flat bands, significant interactions between energy bands, and nontrivial modification of band dispersion at low modulated electric potentials. This work provides a valuable reference for researchers investigating two-dimensional condensed matter materials under superlattice potential modulation.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Accelerated Discovery of Intercalation-type Cathode Materials for Magnesium Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium-ion batteries hold promise as future energy storage solution, yet current Mg cathodes are challenged by low voltage and specific capacity. Herein, we present an AI-driven workflow for discovering high-performance Mg cathode materials. Utilizing the common characteristics of various ionic intercalation-type electrodes, we design and train a Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network model that can accurately predicts electrode voltages for various ions with mean absolute errors (MAE) between 0.25 and 0.33 V. By deploying the trained model to stable Mg compounds from Materials Project and GNoME AI dataset, we identify 160 high voltage structures out of 15,308 candidates with voltages above 3.0 V and volumetric capacity over 800 Ah/L. We further train a precise NequIP model to facilitate accurate and rapid simulations of Mg ionic conductivity. From the 160 high voltage structures, the machine learning molecular dynamics simulations have selected 23 cathode materials with both high energy density and high ionic conductivity. This AI-driven workflow dramatically boosts the efficiency and precision of material discovery for multivalent ion batteries, paving the way for advanced Mg battery development.</description>

      <title>Giant Nernst Angle in Self-Intercalated van der Waals Magnet Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials has propelled advancements in technological devices. The Nernst effect, which generates a transverse electric voltage in the presence of a longitudinal thermal gradient, shows great promise for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we report the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$, a layered self-intercalated vdW material which exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN ~ 191 K followed by a ferromagnetic-like phase transition at TC ~171 K. We observe a prominent topological Hall effect and topological Nernst effect between TC and TN, which is ascribable to non-coplanar spin textures inducing a real-space Berry phase due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we show that Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ exhibits a substantial anomalous Nernst effect, featuring a giant Nernst angle of ~37% near TC and a maximum Nernst thermoelectric coefficient of 0.52 uV/K. These results surpass those of conventional ferromagnets and other two-dimensional vdW materials, highlighting Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ as a promising candidate for advanced thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic properties of CoTeMoO6 revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a comprehensive investigation into the magnetic properties of the chiral multiferroic material CoTeMoO6. In contrast with the previous claim of canted antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnetic components, our investigation reveals an antiferromagnetic ground state with compensated moments, providing an interesting platform for exploring exotic material properties. Through careful measurements of magnetization under a series of applied field, we demonstrate that there exist two sequential field-induced magnetic transitions in CoTeMoO6, with one occurring at $H_{c1}$=460 Oe along the a-axis, and the other at $H_{c2}$=1.16 T with the field along the b-axis. The values of H_c1 and H_c2 exhibit strong angular dependence and diverge with different rates as the applied field is rotated 90 degrees within the ab plane. This reflects the distinct nature of these transitions, which is further supported by the different critical behavior of $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, characterized by the values of $\gamma$,in the function of $H_c=H_0\times(1-\frac{T}{T_c})^n$. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that there exist structural and magnetic twin domains in CoTeMoO6 that strongly affect the experimental measurement of their macroscopic properties. Intriguingly, these twin domains can be related to the orthorhombicity/chirality of the crystal structure with the space group $P2_1 2_1 2$. We further explored the magnetic and structural domains with uniaxial pressure and polarized light microscopy. Our results suggest that CoTeMoO6 could be used as a unique platform for investigating the intriguing physics involving intertwined degrees of freedom. The tunability of the underlying domain distribution and its strong anisotropy could also be useful for developing functional devices and applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting altermagnetism in RuO2: a study of laser-pulse induced charge dynamics by time-domain terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of magnetic material with great potential for applications in the field of spintronics, owing to their non-relativistic spin-splitting and simultaneous antiferromagnetic order. One of the most studied candidates for altermagnetic materials is rutile structured RuO2. However, it has recently come under significant scrutiny as evidence emerged for its lack of any magnetic order. In this work, we study bilayers of epitaxial RuO2 and ferromagnetic permalloy (Fe19Ni81) by time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, probing for three possible mechanisms of laser-induced charge dynamics: the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), electrical anisotropic conductivity (EAC), and inverse altermagnetic spin-splitting effect (IASSE). We examine films of four common RuO2 layer orientations: (001), (100), (110), and (101). If RuO2 is altermagnetic, then the (100) and (101) oriented samples are expected to produce anisotropic emission from the IASSE, however, our results do not indicate the presence of IASSE for either as-deposited or field annealed samples. The THz emission from all samples is instead consistent with charge dynamics induced by only the relativistic ISHE and the non-relativistic and non-magnetic EAC, casting further doubt on the existence of altermagnetism in RuO2. In addition, we find that in the (101) oriented RuO2 sample, the combination of ISHE and EAC emission mechanisms produces THz emission which is tunable between linear and elliptical polarization by modulation of the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ electron-phonon coupling theory of elastic helium atom scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully $ \textit{ab initio} $ approach to predicting thermal attenuation in elastic helium atom scattering amplitudes, validated through strong agreement with experiments on Nb(100) and (3$\times$1)-O/Nb(100) surfaces. Our results reveal the relative contributions from bulk, resonant, and surface phonon modes, as well as from different surface mode polarizations, providing insights into differences between smooth and corrugated surfaces. These findings advance understanding of surface dynamics and electron-phonon coupling, laying groundwork for future studies on surface superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superionic Ionic Conductor Discovery via Multiscale Topological Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium superionic conductors (LSICs) are crucial for next-generation solid-state batteries, offering exceptional ionic conductivity and enhanced safety for renewable energy and electric vehicles. However, their discovery is extremely challenging due to the vast chemical space, limited labeled data, and the understanding of complex structure-function relationships required for optimizing ion transport. This study introduces a multiscale topological learning (MTL) framework, integrating algebraic topology and unsupervised learning to tackle these challenges efficiently. By modeling lithium-only and lithium-free substructures, the framework extracts multiscale topological features and introduces two topological screening metrics-cycle density and minimum connectivity distance-to ensure structural connectivity and ion diffusion compatibility. Promising candidates are clustered via unsupervised algorithms to identify those resembling known superionic conductors. For final refinement, candidates that pass chemical screening undergo ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for validation. This approach led to the discovery of 14 novel LSICs, four of which have been independently validated in recent experiments. This success accelerates the identification of LSICs and demonstrates broad adaptability, offering a scalable tool for addressing complex materials discovery challenges.</description>

      <title>Effect of UHV annealing on morphology and roughness of sputtered $Si(111)-(7\times7)$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Ar^+$ ion has been used regularly for the cleaning of semiconductor, metal surfaces for epitaxial nanostructures growth. We have investigated the effect of low-energy $Ar^+$ ion sputtering and subsequent annealing on the $Si(111)-(7\times7)$ surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition. Using $in-situ$ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) we have compared the morphological changes to the $Si(111)-(7\times7)$ surfaces before and after the sputtering process. Following $500~eV Ar^+$ ion sputtering, the atomically flat $Si(111)-(7\times7)$ surface becomes amorphous. The average root mean square (rms) surface roughness $({\sigma}_{avg})$ of the sputtered surface and that following post-annealing at different temperatures $(500^\circ-700^\circ)C$ under UHV have been measured as a function of STM scan size. While, annealing at $\sim 500^\circ C$ shows no detectable changes in the surface morphology, recrystallization process starts at $\sim 600^\circ C$. For the sputtered samples annealed at temperatures $\geq 600^\circ C, \,log~\sigma_{avg}$ varies linearly at lower length scales and approaches a saturation value of $\sim 0.6 nm$ for the higher length scales confirming the self-affine fractal nature. The correlation length increases with annealing temperature indicating gradual improvement in crystallinity. For the present experimental conditions, $650^\circ C$ is the optimal annealing temperature for recrystallization. The results offer a method to engineer the crystallinity of sputtered surface during nanofabrication process.</description>

      <title>Specific Heat Anomalies and Local Symmetry Breaking in (Anti-)Fluorite Materials: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the high-temperature properties of materials with (anti-)fluorite structures is crucial for their application in nuclear reactors. In this study, we employ machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to investigate the high-temperature thermal properties of thorium dioxide, which has a fluorite structure, and lithium oxide, which has an anti-fluorite structure. Our results show that MLMD simulations effectively reproduce the reported thermal properties of these materials. A central focus of this work is the analysis of specific heat anomalies in these materials at high temperatures, commonly referred to as Bredig, pre-melting, or $\lambda$-transitions. We demonstrate that a local order parameter, analogous to those used to describe liquid-liquid transitions in supercooled water and liquid silica, can effectively characterize these specific heat anomalies. The local order parameter identifies two distinct types of defective structures: lattice defect-like and liquid-like local structures. Above the transition temperature, liquid-like local structures predominate, and the sub-lattice character of mobile atoms disappears.</description>

      <title>SFFT-based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenization is a key technique for approximating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. The FFT-based Homogenization method has gained widespread usage due to its computational efficiency and accuracy in handling complex microstructures. However, despite its advantages, the method is limited by speed and memory constraints, particularly when applied to high-resolution discretizations. These limitations affect its scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale simulations or when dealing with highly detailed microstructures. These challenges arise from the fundamental reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, which imposes inherent restrictions on further advancements. In this paper, we propose a novel SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that utilizes a Quantized Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. This method is tailored to the geometry under consideration and offers significant improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based approach while remaining executable on classical hardware. The method is applicable only if a suitable Quantized Tensor Train representation exists for the stiffness operator associated with the underlying geometry.</description>

      <title>Highly Polarizable Semiconductors and Universal Origin of Ferroelectricity in Materials with a Litharge-Type Structural Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover that a large family of [Pb$_2$F$_2$]- and [Bi$_2$O$_2$]-based mixed-anion materials with a litharge-type structural unit are highly polarizable layered semiconductors on the edge of ferroelectricity. First-principles calculations demonstrate that in this family of materials, compounds as diverse as PbFBr, BiOCl, BiCuOSe, Bi$_2$OS$_2$, and Bi$_5$O$_4$S$_3$Cl exhibit static dielectric constants an order of magnitude higher than typical semiconductors. Additionally, they undergo a ferroelectric transition when subjected to a few percent of tensile strain. The ferroelectric transitions of these materials are found to have a universal origin in the strong cross-bandgap hybridization of the cation $p$ orbitals, enabled by the cation 6s$^2$ lone-pair electrons and the litharge-type structure of the [Pb$_2$F$_2$] and [Bi$_2$O$_2$] layers, as demonstrated by the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in the archetypal litharge $\alpha$-PbO. These results establish materials with a litharge-type structural unit as a large and versatile family of highly polarizable layered semiconductors in proximity to ferroelectricity, offering vast opportunities for multifunctional materials design.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Linker-Born Electron Spin Qubits in UiO-66-NH$_2$ MOF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH$\cdot$ radical spin center in UiO-66-NH$_2$, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH$_2$) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH$\cdot$ spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH$_2$ linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH$_2$ family.</description>

      <title>Sodium diffusion in alkali feldspars: Towards the impact of Al/Si ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracer diffusion of Na in natural alkali feldspars including sanidine, adularia and orthoclase with different Na:K ratios is measured using the radiotracer technique and applying the 22Na radioisotope. The tracer diffusion measurements along the crystallographic directions perpendicular to (001) and (010) in alularia feldspar reveled a slight (within a factor of two to three) anisotropy of Na diffusion with the faster diffusion rates along the perpendicular to (001) directions, while this difference was less prominent in orthoclase. The anisotropy of Na diffusion is specifically addressed for orthoclase and the full diffusion tensor is determined. The impact of temperature and composition on diffusion in natural alkali feldspars is discussed with respect to impurities and intrinsic defects. The state of Al/Si ordering is proposed to have a significant influence on the Na diffusion rates in alkali feldspars.</description>

      <title>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced helicity and texture-dependent switching of nanoscale stochastic domains in a ferromagnetic film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic textures at ever smaller length and time scales is of key fundamental and technological interest. Achieving nanoscale control often relies on finding an external stimulus that is able to act on that small length scales, which is highly challenging. A promising alternative is to achieve nanoscale control using the inhomogeneity of the magnetic texture itself. Using a multilayered ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt thin-film structure as a model system, we employ a magnetic force microscope to investigate the change in magnetic nanotextures induced by circularly polarized picosecond laser pulses. Starting from a saturated magnetic state, we find stochastic nucleation of complex nanotextured domain networks. In particular, the growth of these domains depends not only on their macroscopic magnetization but also on the complexity of the domain texture. This helicity and texture-dependent effect contrasts with the typical homogeneous growth of magnetic domains initiated by an effective magnetic field of a circularly polarized laser pulse. We corroborate our findings with a stochastic model for the nucleation of magnetic domains, in which the nucleation and annihilation probability not only depends on the helicity of light but also on the relative magnetization orientation of neighboring domains. Our results establish a new approach to investigate ultrafast nanoscale magnetism and photo-excitation across first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Near-half-metallic state in the half Heusler PtMnSb film on a III-V substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-orbit coupling within the inversion symmetry-broken structure of half Heuslers provides an ideal platform for various spintronics functionalities. Taking advantage of good lattice matching, it is highly desired to epitaxially integrate promising Heuslers into III-V semiconductor-based devices. PtMnSb is one of the first half Heuslers predicted to be an above-room-temperature half-metal with large spin orbit coupling, however, its half-metallicity and potential as a spintronics material has remained elusive due to lack of high quality samples. Here we demonstrate epitaxial growth of single crystal PtMnSb(001) film on GaSb(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Direct observation of the band structure via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and many-body perturbation theory within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation (QPGW) reveal that PtMnSb hosts rather a near-halfmetallic state with both spin bands crossing the Fermi level and with high spin polarization over 90%. Temperature dependence of magnetization also shows an anomalous enhancement below 60 K, which can be associated with the development of such a near-half-metallic state at low temperatures. Epitaxial growth of high crystalline PtMnSb on a III-V paves the way for systematic clarification of its spin transport properties with fine-tuning of strain in heterostructure devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a ca. 20 \r{A} range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>Robust aluminum nitride passivation of silicon carbide with near-surface spin defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) hosts a number of point defects that are being explored as single-photon emitters for quantum applications. Unfortunately, these quantum emitters lose their photostability when placed in proximity to the surface of the host semiconductor. In principle, a uniform passivation of the surface's dangling bonds by simple adsorbates, such as hydrogen or mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups, should remove detrimental surface effects. However, the usefulness of atomic and molecular passivation schemes is limited by their lack of long-term chemical and/or thermal stability. In this first principles work, we use aluminum nitride (AlN) to passivate SiC surfaces in a core-shell nanowire model. By using a negatively charged silicon vacancy in SiC as the proof-of-principle quantum emitter, we show that AlN-passivation is effective in removing SiC surface states from the band gap and in restoring the defect's optical properties. We also report the existence of novel silicon vacancy-based defects at the SiC-AlN interface.</description>

      <title>On the importance of Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion in the formation of a Ni-Au / p-GaN ohmic contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</description>

      <title>Revealing trends in catalytic activity of adatoms for hydrogen adsorption on carbon: a case study of graphene and carbon nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates advancements in hydrogen storage technologies. This study investigates the hydrogen adsorption characteristics of graphene and a (8,0) carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with adatoms of various elements. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the universal interatomic potential 'PreFerred Potential' (PFP) implemented in the Matlantis framework, we explore the hydrogen storage capabilities of these doped carbon structures at 77K. We analyze the adsorption efficiency based on the position of adatoms (top, bridge, and hollow sites) and find that the group II elements, such as calcium and strontium, exhibit significant hydrogen uptake. Additionally, light elements like lithium and sodium demonstrate enhanced gravimetric hydrogen storage due to their low atomic mass. Our findings provide insights into the potential of doped graphene and CNTs for efficient hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons and polarization anisotropy in hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built from monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals with different lattice orientations, generate interlayer potentials leading to unique excitonic properties. However, the ability to tune the interlayer potential is limited by the fixed covalent 2D lattice geometries. Synthetically substituting one of the layers with an atomically thin molecular crystal could substantially expand the design space for tuning the excitonic response, enabled by explicit control of chemical and electronic structures of the molecular building blocks. Here we report the large-scale synthesis of four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), comprising perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer single crystals, which show precise tuning of the HBC lattices at the molecular level. We observe near-unity anisotropic photoluminescence, which is directly tuned by specific molecular geometry and HBC composition. Our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations show that the anisotropic emission originates from delocalized and anisotropic hybrid excitons. These excitons inherit characteristics from states associated with both the TMD and molecular layers, resulting from a hybridized bilayer band structure of the HBC. By introducing HBCs as a scalable solid-state platform, our work paves the way for tunable interlayer energy landscapes achievable through direct synthesis, opening up new frontiers in molecule-based quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Strain Tuning of Er3+ in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Er3+ color centers are promising candidates for quantum science and technology due to their long electron and nuclear spin coherence times, as well as their desirable emission wavelength. By selecting host materials with suitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used to tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric material with known methods of engineering different domain configurations through epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin films, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is resolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the optical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the ferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks for films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these results to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3 crystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original substituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship between the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix lays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering ferroelectric order parameters</description>

      <title>Elucidating microstructural influences on fatigue behavior for additively manufactured Hastelloy X using Bayesian-calibrated crystal plasticity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity (CP) modeling is a vital tool for predicting the mechanical behavior of materials, but its calibration involves numerous (&gt;8) constitutive parameters, often requiring time-consuming trial-and-error methods. This paper proposes a robust calibration approach using Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify optimal CP model parameters under fatigue loading conditions. Utilizing cyclic data from additively manufactured Hastelloy X specimens at 500 degree-F, the BO framework, integrated with a Gaussian process surrogate model, significantly reduces the number of required simulations. A novel objective function is developed to match experimental stress-strain data across different strain amplitudes. Results demonstrate that effective CP model calibration is achieved within 75 iterations, with as few as 50 initial simulations. Sensitivity analysis reveals the influence of CP parameters at various loading points on the stress-strain curve. The results show that the stress-strain response is predominantly controlled by parameters related to yield, with increased influence from backstress parameters during compressive loading. In addition, the effect of introducing twins into the synthetic microstructure on fatigue behavior is studied, and a relationship between microstructural features and the fatigue indicator parameter is established. Results show that larger diameter grains, which exhibit a higher Schmid factor and an average misorientation of approximately 42 degrees +/- 1.67 degree, are identified as probable sites for failure. The proposed optimization framework can be applied to any material system or CP model, streamlining the calibration process and improving the predictive accuracy of such models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking large language models for materials synthesis: the case of atomic layer deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an open-ended question benchmark, ALDbench, to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in materials synthesis, and in particular in the field of atomic layer deposition, a thin film growth technique used in energy applications and microelectronics. Our benchmark comprises questions with a level of difficulty ranging from graduate level to domain expert current with the state of the art in the field. Human experts reviewed the questions along the criteria of difficulty and specificity, and the model responses along four different criteria: overall quality, specificity, relevance, and accuracy. We ran this benchmark on an instance of OpenAI's GPT-4o. The responses from the model received a composite quality score of 3.7 on a 1 to 5 scale, consistent with a passing grade. However, 36% of the questions received at least one below average score. An in-depth analysis of the responses identified at least five instances of suspected hallucination. Finally, we observed statistically significant correlations between the difficulty of the question and the quality of the response, the difficulty of the question and the relevance of the response, and the specificity of the question and the accuracy of the response as graded by the human experts. This emphasizes the need to evaluate LLMs across multiple criteria beyond difficulty or accuracy.</description>

      <title>The role of nuclear spin diffusion in dynamic nuclear polarization of crystalline nanoscale silicon particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized nanoparticles (NPs) offer high polarization levels with room temperature relaxation times exceeding half an hour. In this work, we demonstrate that the achievable hyperpolarization enhancement and relaxation (decay) time at room temperature are largely independent of the particle size contrary to previous assumptions. This is explained through first-principles spin-diffusion coefficient calculations and finite-element polarization simulations. The simulated zero-quantum (flip-flop) line width governing the spin diffusion is found to agree with the experimentally accessible single-quantum (single spin flip, e.g. radio-frequency pulse) line width. The transport of hyperpolarization from strongly hyperfine-coupled spins towards the bulk is most likelybelieved to be responsible for the slow polarization dynamics including long room temperature decay time. The line width and spin-diffusion simulations are extended to other cubic crystal structures and analytical expressions, which only require insertion of the gyromagnetic ratio, lattice constant, isotope abundance and measured spectral density distribution (nuclear line width), are fitted. The presented simulations can be adjusted to study spin diffusion in other materials.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Networks: A Lattice System Analysis Model Based on Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the intricate interactions between particles within a system is a key approach to revealing the essential characteristics of the system, whether it is an in-depth analysis of molecular properties in the field of chemistry or the design of new materials for specific performance requirements in materials science. To this end, we propose Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Network (GAHN), a neural network method that can understand the underlying structure of lattice Hamiltonian systems solely through the dynamic trajectories of particles. We can determine which particles in the system interact with each other, the proportion of interactions between different particles, and whether the potential energy of interactions between particles exhibits even symmetry or not. The obtained structure helps the neural network model to continue predicting the trajectory of the system and further understand the dynamic properties of the system. In addition to understanding the underlying structure of the system, it can be used for detecting lattice structural abnormalities, such as link defects, abnormal interactions, etc. These insights benefit system optimization, design, and detection of aging or damage. Moreover, this approach can integrate other components to deduce the link structure needed for specific parts, showcasing its scalability and potential. We tested it on a challenging molecular dynamics dataset, and the results proved its ability to accurately infer molecular bond connectivity, highlighting its scientific research potential.</description>

      <title>Room temperature exciton-polariton neural network with perovskite crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limitations of electronics have stimulated the search for novel unconventional computing platforms that enable energy-efficient and ultra-fast information processing. Among various systems, exciton-polaritons stand out as promising candidates for the realization of optical neuromorphic devices. This is due to their unique hybrid light-matter properties, resulting in strong optical nonlinearity and excellent transport capabilities. However, previous implementations of polariton neural networks have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures, limiting their practical applications. In this work, using non-equillibrium Bose-Einstein condensation in a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide, we demonstrate the first room-temperature exciton-polariton neural network. Its performance is verified in various machine learning tasks, including binary classification, and object detection. Our result is a crucial milestone in the development of practical applications of polariton neural networks and provides new perspectives for optical computing accelerators based on perovskites.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological States and Chirality by Non-Equilibrium Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonics systems opens new opportunities for developing robust low-power spin-wave-based devices. Introducing non-equilibrium antimagnon can bring additional effects to the topology and chirality. In this report, we revisit the ferromagnetic multilayers with a non-equilibrium state and generalize it to antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayers. We found that non-equilibrium states with the perturbative coupling of magnon and antimagnon can turn an originally trivial state into a non-trivial one, characterized by Chern number. Both coherent coupling and dissipative coupling are found in the band structures and can be controlled by the external magnetic field and torques. Further, in the bilayer unit cell, all four possible chirality combinations are achieved at a few GHz. Our work presents an accessible platform for realizing topological magnonic surface states, paving the way for controlling magnon chirality and facilitating various types of coupling.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for incommensurate antiferromagnetism in nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection between nonsymmorphic symmetry and electronic correlations has emerged as a platform for topological Kondo semimetallic states and unconventional spin textures. Here we report the synthesis of nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ single crystals and their structural, electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties. UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) below $T_N\simeq$ 161 K as evidenced by a sharp cusp in magnetic susceptibility, a second-order phase transition in specific heat, and an upturn in electrical resistivity, which suggests an incommensurate AFM structure that deviates from the A-type magnetism typically observed in this class of materials. Across $T_N$, Hall effect measurements reveal a change from electron-dominated to hole-dominated transport, which points to a sharp reconstruction in the electronic structure at $T_N$. Upon further cooling, a first-order transition is observed at $T_1 \simeq 30 $K in magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity but not in electrical resistivity or Hall measurements, which indicates a small change in the AFM structure that does not affect the electronic structure. Our specific heat data reveal a small Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma \simeq$13 mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$), consistent with localized 5$f$ electrons. Our results indicate that UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ hosts weak electronic correlations and is likely away from a Kondo semimetallic state. Low-temperature magnetization measurements show that the AFM structure is remarkably stable to 160 kOe and does not undergo any field-induced transitions. Neutron diffraction and magnetization experiments at higher fields would be valuable to probe the presence of unconventional spin textures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and heat transport of quantum spin liquid candidates NaYbS$_2$ and NaYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultralow-temperature thermodynamics and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of the single-crystal rare-earth chalcogenides NaYbS$_2$ and NaYbSe$_2$, which have an ideal triangular lattice of the Yb$^{3+}$ ions and have been proposed to be quantum spin liquid candidates. The magnetic specific heat divided by temperature $C_{\rm{mag}}/T$ is nearly constant at $T &lt;$ 200 mK, which is indeed the indication of the gapless magnetic excitations with a constant density of states. However, we observe a vanishingly small residual term $\kappa_0/T$, which points to the absence of mobile fermionic excitations in these materials. Both the weak temperature dependence of $\kappa$ and the strong magnetic-field dependence of $\kappa$ suggest the significant scattering between the spinons and phonons, which actually supports the existence of gapless or tiny-gapped quantum spin liquid. Moreover, the $\kappa(B)/\kappa(0)$ isotherms show a series of field-induced magnetic transitions for $B \parallel a$, confirming the easy-plane anisotropy, which is consistent with the results of ac magnetic susceptibility. We expect our results to inspire further interests in the understanding of the spinon-phonon coupling in the spin liquid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have explored the relaxation process of the spin glass phase in Bi2Fe3GaO9, a geometrically frustrated magnet with a unique structure consisting of pentagonal building blocks known as the Cairo lattice. Using dc magnetization measurements on single crystals, we estimate the relaxation time across various temperatures and fields. Our results indicate that the relaxation time of Bi2Fe3GaO9 follows the Arrhenius law as a function of temperature but remains relatively constant as the applied magnetic field varies. Further, through a carefully designed protocol, we observe significant rejuvenation and memory effects. Remarkably, the memory effects in Bi2Fe3GaO9 are found to be more similar to those observed in classical spin glasses rather than in spin jamming systems, both in terms of the magnitude of the memory effect and the value of the exponent that describes the relaxation behavior. Our findings suggest that Bi2Fe3GaO9 provides an excellent platform for investigating the time-dependent evolution of underlying magnetism using neutron scattering, paving the way for future research.</description>

      <title>Spin-transfer torque in altermagnets with magnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Polarization Uniformity in Ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ Devices within Back End of Line Thermal Budget for Memory and Neuromorphic Applications</title>

Abstract: Thin film ferroelectric devices with ultralow power operation, non-volatile data retention and fast and reliable switching are attractive for non-volatile memory and as synaptic weight elements. However, low thermal budget ferroelectric oxides suffer from crystalline inhomogeneity and defects that makes their large-scale circuit integration challenging. Here, we report on the thermally engineered way to induce wafer-scale homogeneity in Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ capacitors that can lead to high device reliability making their integration possible in ultralow power memory and neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Category-Specific Topological Learning of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials with high surface area, adjustable porosity, and structural tunability, making them ideal for diverse applications. However, traditional experimental and computational methods have limited scalability and interpretability, hindering effective exploration of MOF structure-property relationships. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a category-specific topological learning (CSTL), which combines algebraic topology with chemical insights for robust property prediction. The model represents MOF structures as simplicial complexes and incorporates elemental categorizations to enable balanced, interpretable machine learning study. By integrating category-specific persistent homology, CSTL captures both global and local structural characteristics, rendering multi-dimensional, category-specific descriptors that support a predictive model with high accuracy and robustness across eight MOF datasets, outperforming all previous results. This alignment of topological and chemical features enhances the predictive power and interpretability of CSTL, advancing understanding of structure-property relationships of MOFs and promoting efficient material discovery.</description>

      <title>Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. Until recently, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of polyhydrides severely limited the list of experimental techniques that could be used to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how 1H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. We observed a pronounced suppression of the 1H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses by the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$.Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all 1H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, indicating a superconducting transition in the sample. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. Fitting the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation data allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</description>

      <title>High dynamic-range quantum sensing of magnons and their dynamics using a superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons can endow quantum devices with new functionalities. Assessing their potential requires precise characterization of magnon properties. Here, we use a superconducting qubit to probe magnons in a ferrimagnet over a range of about 2000 excitations. Using qubit control and parametrically induced qubit-magnon interactions we demonstrate few-excitation sensitive detection of magnons and are able to accurately resolve their decay. These results introduce quantum circuits as high-dynamic range probes for magnons and provide an avenue toward sensitive detection of nontrivial magnon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Directional Swimming of B. Subtilis Bacteria Near a Switchable Polar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of swimming bacteria depend on the properties of their habitat media. Recently it was shown that the motion of swimming bacteria dispersed directly in a non-toxic water-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal can be controlled by the director field of the liquid crystal. Here we investigate whether the macroscopic polar order of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) can be recognized by bacteria B. Subtilis swimming in a water dispersion adjacent to a glassy NF film by surface interactions alone. We show that B. Subtilis tends to move in the direction antiparallel to the spontaneous electric polarization at the NF surface. Their speed was found to be the same with or without a polar NF layer. In contrast to observation on crystal ferroelectric films, the bacteria do not get immobilized. These observations may offer a pathway to creation of polar microinserts to direct bacterial motion in-vivo.</description>

      <title>Industrial-scale Prediction of Cement Clinker Phases using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped 3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low frequency 1/f noise from the environment.</description>

      <title>Simulation of dendritic-eutectic growth with the phase-field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solidification is an important process in many alloy processing routes. The solidified microstructure of alloys is usually made up of dendrites, eutectics or a combination of both. The evolving morphologies are largely determined by the solidification process and thus many materials properties are dependent on the processing conditions. While the growth of either type of microstructure is well-investigated, there is little information on the coupled growth of both microstructures. This work aims to close this gap by formulating a phase-field model capable of reproducing dendritic, eutectic as well as dendritic-eutectic growth. Following this, two-dimensional simulations are conducted which show all three types of microstructures depending on the composition and processing conditions. The effect of the dendritic-eutectic growth on the microstructural lengths, which determine materials properties, is investigated and the morphological hysteresis between eutectic growth and dendritic-eutectic growth is studied by employing solidification velocity jumps. Further, the influence of primary crystallization is investigated in large-scale two-dimensional simulations. Finally, qualitative three-dimensional simulations are conducted to test for morphological changes in the eutectic.</description>

      <title>Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases as a material platform for altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subclass of collinear antiferromagnets where spin Kramers degeneracy is broken -- resulting in ferromagnetic-like properties -- offers exciting new opportunities in magnetism and hence motivates the reasoned expansion of the material base for these so-called altermagnets. Here, we show that Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases are generic hosts for altermagnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate altermagnetism in prototypical nickel-based systems such as La$_2$NiO$_4$ and identify additional candidates, including the superconducting La$_3$Ni$_3$O$_7$ and the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. These materials span insulating, semiconducting, and metallic conduction types, with computed nonrelativistic spin splittings reaching up to 250~meV. Our analysis also reveals the presence of accidental nodes and distinct topologies in the spin-momentum texture at the Brillouin-zone boundary, suggesting a refined classification for altermagnetic materials beyond the $d$-wave or higher even-parity wave classes. In addition, we address formal inconsistencies in the traditional classification of magnetically ordered systems, proposing resolutions grounded in the altermagnetic framework, and point out the potential for altermagnetic behavior in systems beyond collinear antiferromagnets with perfectly compensated magnetization, broadening the scope for future exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and characterize a novel two-dimensional material, 2D-CRO, derived from bulk calcium-based ruthenates (CROs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, Ca$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n = 1$ and $2$). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer limit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic properties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by zero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through dimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion symmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the absence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and computational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both with and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that contribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO as a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and topological features.</description>

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) has proven to be a highly effective route for discovering new materials. Substantial advancements have been made in CSP of inorganic and molecular crystals, while hybrid materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been unfairly overlooked. The ab initio techniques adopted for the CSP of MOFs cannot be scaled to a high-throughput regime, which is required for efficient exploration of the immense chemical space. Here, we propose a data-driven method to tackle current needs of computational MOF discovery. By examining CSP through the lens of reticular chemistry, coarse-grained neural networks were implemented to predict underlying net topology of crystal graphs. The models showed satisfactory performance, which was next enhanced by limiting the applicability domain. Flue gas separation was used as an illustrative example to validate the proposed CSP approach. Several hundred in silico-generated systems revealed a notable discrepancy in adsorption capacity among competing polymorphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in tuning the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of two-dimensional materials, influenced by the number of layers, interlayer distances, and stacking order. However, its effect on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that interlayer coupling can significantly alter the magnetic easy-axis orientation, as shown by the magnetic easy-axis of monolayer 1T-MnSe2 tilting 67{\deg} from the z-axis, while aligning with the z-axis in the bilayer. This change results from variations in orbital occupations near the Fermi level, particularly involving nonmetallic Se atoms. Contrary to the traditional focus on magnetic metal atoms, our findings reveal that Se orbitals play a key role in influencing the easy-axis orientation and topological Chern numbers. Furthermore, we validated our conclusions by changing stacking orders, introducing charge doping, applying in-plane biaxial strains, and substituting non-metallic atoms. Our results highlight the pivotal role of interlayer coupling in tuning the magnetic properties of layered materials, with important implications for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kagome Materials: Theoretical Insights, Experimental Realizations, and Electronic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the discovery and construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome materials. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice model and its variants, followed by discussions on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of 2D kagome materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarons are crucial for charge transport in semiconductors, significantly impacting material properties and device performance. The dynamics of small polarons can be investigated using first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD). However, the limited timescale of these simulations presents a challenge for adequately sampling infrequent polaron hopping events. Here, we introduce a message-passing neural network combined with FPMD within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, that learns the polaronic potential energy surface by encoding the polaronic state, allowing for simulations of polaron hopping dynamics at the nanosecond scale. By leveraging the statistical significance of the long timescale, our framework can accurately estimate polaron (anisotropic) mobilities and activation barriers in prototypical polaronic oxides across different scenarios (hole polarons in rocksalt MgO and electron polarons in pristine and F-doped rutile TiO$_2$) within experimentally measured ranges.</description>

      <title>API Phonons: Python Interfaces for Phonon Transport Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: API Phonons is a Python software package to predict the transport dynamics of heat-carrying phonons. Using the powerful syntax of Python, this package provides modules and functions interfacing between different packages for atomistic simulations, lattice dynamics, and phonon-phonon interaction calculations including LAMMPS, Quippy, Phonopy, and ShengBTE. API Phonons enabled complex phonon calculations, including (1) extracting harmonic and anharmonic force constants from arbitrary interatomic potentials, which can be used as inputs for solving Boltzmann transport equations; (2) predicting thermal conductivity using Kubo's linear response theory, which captures both quasiparticle transport and inter-band coherent transport; and (3) modeling of ultrafast pump-probe thermal responses using a Green's function approach based on mode-resolved phonon properties for studying ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport dynamics. The package provides a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensive platform for modeling phonon transport physics through Python programming.</description>

      <title>Prolonging Carrier Lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC Epilayer by Thermal Oxidation and Hydrogen Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minority carrier lifetime of 25.46 $\mu$s in a P-type 4H-SiC epilayer has been attained through sequential thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing. Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advances in manufacturing making metal functionally graded materials (FGMs) more common, numerical methods for predicting fracture in ductile functionally graded materials remain limited. In this work we study the crack propagation in ductile FGMs, specifically focusing on crack propagation within the gradient region of an FGM. We investigate the direct effects of plasticity, and the exact correlations between accumulated plastic strain and crack growth patterns in an FGM. Through this, we determine key differences in crack growth patterns between well-studied brittle FGMs, and more recently developed ductile FGMs. We provide substantial insight on the influence of both the angle of incidence and the width of the gradient, and expose potential pathways for engineering crack-arresting behavior in ductile FGMs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of direct-gap optical emission in hexagonal Ge and its enhancement via strain engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of hexagonal Ge (2H-Ge) as a candidate direct-gap group-IV semiconductor for Si photonics mandates rigorous understanding of its optoelectronic properties. Theoretical predictions of a "pseudo-direct" band gap, characterized by weak oscillator strength, contrast with a claimed high radiative recombination coefficient $B$ comparable to conventional (cubic) InAs. We compute $B$ in 2H-Ge from first principles and quantify its dependence on temperature, carrier density and strain. For unstrained 2H-Ge, our calculated spontaneous emission spectra corroborate that measured photoluminescence corresponds to direct-gap emission, but with $B$ being approximately three orders of magnitude lower than in InAs. We confirm a pseudo-direct- to direct-gap transition under $\sim 2$\% [0001] uniaxial tension, which can enhance $B$ by up to three orders of magnitude, making it comparable to that of InAs. Beyond quantifying strong enhancement of $B$ via strain engineering, our analysis suggests the dominance of additional, as-yet unquantified recombination mechanisms in this nascent material.</description>

Abstract: This chapter reviews the state of the art in mutually synchronized spin-torque and spin Hall nano-oscillator (STNO and SHNO) arrays. After briefly introducing the underlying physics, we discuss different nano-oscillator implementations and their functional properties with respect to frequency range, output power, phase noise, and modulation rates. We then introduce the concepts and the theory of mutual synchronization and discuss the possible coupling mechanisms in spintronic nano-oscillators, such as dipolar, electrical, and spin-wave coupling. We review the experimental literature on mutually synchronized STNOs and SHNOs in one- and two-dimensional arrays and discuss ways to increase the number of mutually synchronized nano-oscillators. Finally, the potential for applications ranging from microwave signal sources/detectors and ultrafast spectrum analyzers to neuromorphic computing elements and Ising machines is discussed together with the specific electronic circuitry that has been designed so far to harness this potential.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-temperature spin-freezing in frustrated Kitaev magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offers an ideal platform to host non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit-driven frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the characteristic interaction energy scale of spins. The temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat exhibits Cm~ T^2 dependence near the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior of Cm below the freezing temperature implies the presence of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in the Kitaev magnets suggest a non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing. Furthermore, the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior below the spin-freezing temperature, suggesting the persistence of unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS) hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization induced by magnons and magnon Nernst effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons offer a promising path toward energy-efficient information transmission and the development of next-generation classical and quantum computing technologies. However, methods to efficiently excite, manipulate, and detect magnons remain a critical need. Here, we show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization as a result of both their spin and orbital moments. We demonstrate this by calculating the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb antiferromagnets. The electric polarization becomes finite when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is present and its magnitude can be increased by symmetries of the system. We illustrate this by computing and comparing the electric polarizations induced by the magnon Nernst effects in 2D materials with N\'eel and Zigzag ordering. Our findings show that in the Zigzag order, where the effect is dominated by the magnon orbital moment, the induced electric polarization is approximately three orders of magnitude greater than in the N\'eel phase. These findings reveal that electric fields could enable both detection and manipulation of magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could lead to more practical use of magnons for future computing and information transmission device applications.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetic Moment Dynamics and Hanle Magnetoresistance in Multilayered 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE), resulting from non-trivial quantum geometry of 2D materials, has several potential advantages over the spin Hall effect (SHE), the latter being well known for its many applications in spintronics. Like the spin Hall effect, the OHE occurs in nonmagnetic materials without stringent symmetry requirements, but unlike the SHE it does no rely on relatively weak spin-orbit interaction. In 2D materials, these advantages risk to be nullified by the difficulty of turning the orbital moment away from the out-of-plane direction. Multilayered 2D materials offer a way out of this difficulty because the fluctuating in-plane component of the orbital moment, due to motion of electrons between the layers, can latch to a magnetic field. To describe this effect we have derived a semi-phenomenological equation of motion for the density of orbital magnetic moment in stacked 2D materials subjected to a magnetic field. Unlike the equations of motion for the spin, these equations produce a strongly anisotropic dynamics, which is governed by an inverse effective mass tensor for which we provide a fully microscopic expression. As a first application, we combine our equation of motion with phenomenological drift-diffusion equations to obtain a theory of orbital Hanle magnetoresistance in multilayered 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Precise wave manipulation has undoubtedly forged the technological landscape we thrive in today. Although our understanding of wave phenomena has come a long way since the earliest observations of desert dunes or ocean waves, the unimpeded development of mathematics has enabled ever more complex and exotic physical phenomena to be comprehensively described. Here, we take wave manipulation a step further by introducing an unprecedented synthetic acoustic crystal capable of realizing simultaneous linear broadband conduction and nonlinear topological insulation, depicting a robust amplitude-dependent mode localized deep within - i.e. an amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound. The latter is achieved by means of an open acoustic waveguide lined with a chain of nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled active electroacoustic resonators. Starting from a comprehensive topological model for classical waves, we demonstrate that different topological regimes can be accessed by increasing driving amplitude and that topological robustness against coupling disorder is a direct consequence of symmetric and simultaneous response between coupled resonators. Theoretical predictions are validated by a fully programmable experimental apparatus capable of realizing the real-time manipulation of metacrystal properties. In all, our results provide a solid foundation for future research in the design and manipulation of classical waves in artificial materials involving nonlinearity, nonlocality, and non-hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Role of Wettability, Adhesion, and Instabilities in Transitions During Lubricated Sliding Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lubricated contacts in soft materials are important in various engineering systems and natural settings. Three major lubrication regimes are boundary (BL), mixed (ML), and elasto-hydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication, where the contact region is dry, partially wetted, or fully wetted, respectively. The transition between these regimes is insufficiently understood, especially for soft contacts, which impedes desired control of lubricated sliding friction. Here, we report on the role of solid wettability and adhesion on these transitions. Wettability of glycerol on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and adhesion between a glass indenter and PDMS, were varied by exposure of the PDMS to an ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-Ozone) cleaner. By combining friction tests and visualization, we demonstrate that the transition from ML to BL regime is dominated by the wettability of the lubricant; increasing wettability of glycerol makes removal of liquid from the contact region more difficult. Transition from EHL to ML is related to a series of events with increasing normal load, which are thinning of the lubricant layer, sudden jump to contact between the glass indenter and solid substrate across a gap of tens to a few hundreds of nanometers, and attendant elastic instabilities such as wrinkling and stick-slip. These results provide a deeper understanding of transitions in lubricated frictional behavior of soft materials which govern the maximum and minimum friction achievable.</description>

      <title>Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>
