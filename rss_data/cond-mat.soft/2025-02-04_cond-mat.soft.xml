      <title>The electrostatic charge on a falling water drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications in various fields, from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with apparent stochastic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by various, material-dependent electrostatic processes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relations between nearest-neighbor persistence and slow heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones model of glass-forming liquids, we examine how the decay of the normalized neighbor-persistence function $C_{\rm B}(t)$, which decays from unity at short times to zero at long times as particles lose the neighbors that were present in their original first coordination shell, compares with those of other, more conventionally utilized relaxation metrics. In the strongly-non-Arrhenius temperature regime below the onset temperature $T_{\rm A}$, we find that $C_{\rm B}(t)$ can be described using the same stretched-exponential functional form that is often utilized to fit the self-intermediate scattering function $S(q, t)$ of glass-forming liquids in this regime. The ratio of the bond lifetime $\tau_{\rm bond}$ associated with the terminal decay of $C_{\rm B}(t)$ to the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ varies appreciably and non-monotonically with $T$, peaking at $\tau_{\rm bond}/\tau_\alpha \simeq 45$ at $T \simeq T_{\rm x}$, where $T_{\rm x}$ is a crossover temperature separating the high- and low-temperature regimes of glass-formation. In contrast, $\tau_{\rm bond}$ remains on the order of the overlap time $\tau_{\rm ov}$ (the time interval over which a typical particle moves by half its diameter), and the peak time $\tau_\chi$ for the susceptibility $\chi_{\rm B}(t)$ associated with the spatial heterogeneity of $C_{\rm B}(t)$ remains on the order of $\tau_{\rm imm}$ (the characteristic lifetime of immobile-particle clusters), even as each of these quantities varies by roughly $5$ orders of magnitude over our studied range of $T$. Thus, we show that $C_{\rm B}(t)$ and $\chi_{\rm B}(t)$ provide semi-quantitative spatially-averaged measures of the slow heterogeneous dynamics associated with the persistence of immobile-particle clusters.</description>

      <title>Influence of transition mutations and disorder on charge localization and transfer along B-DNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illuminate the influence of transition mutations and disorder on charge localization and transfer along B-DNA sequences. Homopolymers are the best for charge transfer (cf. Refs.~ \cite{LVBMS:2018, MLTS:2019}). Hence, we consider as flawless a homopolymer sequence and then disturb it, introducing transition mutations and disorder. We exclude the possibility of charge transfer via the backbone that will be addressed soon in another work. We employ the Tight Binding (TB) Wire model to study the influence of transition mutations and the TB Fishbone Wire model to evaluate the influence of disorder emanating either from the $\pi$ path or from the backbone. For the TB Wire parameters, we employ the parametrization created in Ref.~\cite{MLS:2023}, where another TB at atomic level was used, considering all valence orbitals of all atoms. We calculate the HOMO and LUMO regime eigenenergies and eigenvectors, the participation ratio (a measure of the localization of each eigenstate), the time-dependent probability to find the carrier at each site, the mean over time probability at each site, and the mean transfer rate from site to site. Transition mutations increase localization in terms of participation ratio and impede charge transfer in terms of mean probability and transfer rates, provided the TB parameters involving mutated sites are significantly modified relative to the original. Disorder leads to severe modifications of participation ratios, i.e., increase of localization. Relevant changes occur on eigenenergies, mean probabilities at each site, and transfer rates.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of nonlinear elastic moduli of polystyrene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear elastic properties of polymers and polymeric composites are essential for accurate prediction of their response to dynamic loads, which is crucial in a wide range of applications. These properties can be affected by strain rate, temperature, and pressure. The temperature susceptibility of nonlinear elastic moduli of polymers remains poorly understood. We have recently observed a significant frequency dependence of the nonlinear elastic (Murnaghan) moduli of polystyrene. In this paper we expand this analysis by the temperature dependence. The measurement methodology was based on the acousto-elastic effect, and involved analysis of the dependencies of velocities of longitudinal and shear single-frequency ultrasonic waves in the sample on the applied static pressure. Measurements were performed at different temperatures in the range of 25-65 {\deg}C and at different frequencies in the range of 0.75-3 MHz. The temperature susceptibility of the nonlinear moduli $l$ and $m$ was found to be two orders of magnitude larger than that of linear moduli $\lambda$ and $\mu$. At the same time, the observed variations of $n$ modulus with temperature were low and within the measurement tolerance. The observed tendencies can be explained by different influence of pressure on relaxation processes in the material at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Nonaffine motion in flowing highly polydisperse granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the particle-scale motion of highly polydisperse hard disks flowing in a two-dimensional bent channel. We use various size distributions of particles, in which the largest particles are up to five times larger than the smallest. The disks are pushed through an L-shaped channel to drive the particle rearrangements. Although the mean flow is essentially independent of the polydispersity, the motion of individual particles becomes more nonaffine on average for higher polydispersity samples. We characterize the nonaffine motion, finding a qualitative difference in the behavior of small and larger particles: the smaller disks have more nonaffine motion, induced by the larger particles.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Discrete Differential Geometry: A Virtual Playground for the Bilayer Soft Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications across various domains. A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the Discrete Elastic Rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry (DDG), the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), particularly in handling contact interactions -- an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. Our simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and inter-layer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of slow earthquake statistics in low-friction soft granular shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and limited size distribution. What mechanisms cause slow earthquakes that manifest these unique statistics? We experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. Using a hydrogel particle layer floated on lubricating fluid, we conducted stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with monotonous structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may monitor pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.</description>

      <title>Robustness of stress focusing in soft lattices under topology-switching deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in topological mechanics have demonstrated the ability of Maxwell lattices to effectively focus stress along domain walls between differently polarized domains. The focusing ability can be exploited to protect the lattice bulk from accidental stress concentration -- and eventually onset and propagation of fracture -- at structural hot spots such as defects and cracks. A recent study has revisited the problem for structural lattices featuring non-ideal hinges, showing that the focusing remains robust, albeit diluted in strength. Realizing that the problem of domain wall localization has been traditionally framed in the context of linear elasticity, in this work we extend the study to the realm of soft structures undergoing nonlinear finite deformation. Through experiments performed on silicone hyperelastic prototypes, we assess and quantify the robustness of the phenomenon against the macroscopic shape changes induced by large deformation, with special attention to deformation levels that alter the topology of the bulk, lifting the topological protection. Furthermore, we identify a simple geometric indicator for this transition.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Mixing by squirmers in stratified fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</description>

      <title>Scalability of Graph Neural Network in Accurate Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Surface polarization strongly influences electrostatics in a nonlocal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear shallow-water waves with vertical odd viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</description>

Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anistropic spheres and ellipsoids and present the results for spheres. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>
