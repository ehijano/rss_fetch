      <title>How much does SNAP Matter? SNAP's Effects on Food Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) aims to improve food security of low-income households in the U.S. A new, continuous food security measure called the Probability of Food Security (PFS), which proxies for the official food security measure but is implementable on longer periods, enables the study of SNAP's effects on the intensive margin. Using variations in state-level SNAP administrative policies as an instrument for individual SNAP participation, I find that SNAP does not have significant effects on estimated food security on average, both on the entire population and low-income population whom I defined as income is below 130\% of poverty line at least once during the study period. I find SNAP has stronger positive effects on those whose estimated food security status is in the middle of the distribution, but has no significant effects in the tails of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Training for Obsolescence? The AI-Driven Education Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence simultaneously transforms human capital production in schools and its demand in labor markets. Analyzing these effects in isolation can lead to a significant misallocation of educational resources. We model an educational planner whose decision to adopt AI is driven by its teaching productivity, failing to internalize AI's future wage-suppressing effect on those same skills. Our core assumption, motivated by a pilot survey, is that there is a positive correlation between these two effects. This drives our central proposition: this information failure creates a skill mismatch that monotonically increases with AI prevalence. Extensions show the mismatch is exacerbated by the neglect of unpriced non-cognitive skills and by a school's endogenous over-investment in AI. Our findings caution that policies promoting AI in education, if not paired with forward-looking labor market signals, may paradoxically undermine students' long-term human capital, especially if reliance on AI crowds out the development of unpriced non-cognitive skills, such as persistence, that are forged through intellectual struggle.</description>

      <title>The Walras-Bowley Lecture: Fragmentation of Matching Markets and How Economics Can Help Integrate Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19628v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation of matching markets is a ubiquitous problem across countries and across applications. In order to study the implications of fragmentation and possibilities for integration, we first document and discuss a variety of fragmentation cases in practice such as school choice, medical residency matching, and so forth. Using the real-life dataset of daycare matching markets in Japan, we then empirically evaluate the impact of interregional transfer of students by estimating student utility functions under a variety of specifications and then using them for counterfactual simulation. Our simulation compares a fully integrated market and a partially integrated one with a "balancedness" constraint -- for each region, the inflow of students from the other regions must be equal to the outflow to the other areas. We find that partial integration achieves 39.2 to 59.6% of the increase in the child welfare that can be attained under full integration, which is equivalent to a 3.3 to 4.9% reduction of travel time. The percentage decrease in the unmatch rate is 40.0 to 52.8% under partial integration compared to the case of full integration. The results suggest that even in environments where full integration is not a realistic option, partial integration, i.e., integration that respects the balancedness constraint, has a potential to recover a nontrivial portion of the loss from fragmentation.</description>

      <title>There must be an error here! Experimental evidence on coding errors' biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative research relies heavily on coding, and coding errors are relatively common even in published research. In this paper, we examine whether individuals are more or less likely to check their code depending on the results they obtain. We test this hypothesis in a randomized experiment embedded in the recruitment process for research positions at a large international economic organization. In a coding task designed to assess candidates' programming abilities, we randomize whether participants obtain an expected or unexpected result if they commit a simple coding error. We find that individuals are 20% more likely to detect coding errors when they lead to unexpected results. This asymmetry in error detection depending on the results they generate suggests that coding errors may lead to biased findings in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Predicting Qualification Thresholds in UEFA's incomplete round-robin tournaments via a Dixon and Coles Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 2024/25 season, UEFA introduced the incomplete round-robin format in the Champions League and Europa League, replacing the traditional group stage with a single league phase table of all 36 teams. Now, the top eight qualify directly for the round of 16, while teams ranked 9th-24th enter a play-off round. Existing simulation-based analyses, such as those by Opta, provide guidance on points presumably needed for qualification but show discrepancies when compared to actual outcomes in the first season. We address this gap using a bivariate Dixon and Coles model to address lower draw frequencies, with team strengths proxied by Elo ratings. This framework allows us to simulate matches and derive qualification thresholds for direct and play-off advancement. Our results offer scientific guidance for clubs and managers, improving strategic decision-making under the new UEFA club competition formats.</description>
