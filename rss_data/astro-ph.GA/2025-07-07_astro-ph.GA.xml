      <title>A Multi-Data Approach to Open Clusters: Roslund 3 and Ruprecht 174 in CCD UBV and Gaia DR3 Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters Roslund 3 and Ruprecht1 74 is carried out using CCD UBV photometry in conjunction with astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Membership probabilities were computed via the UPMASK algorithm applied to Gaia proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes, leading to the identification of 198 likely members for Roslund 3 and 397 for Ruprecht 174. Astrophysical parameters were derived using both the classical approach, where parameters are independently determined, and a MCMC technique, which estimates them simultaneously. The agreement between the results from both methods confirms their reliability and highlights the robustness of the classical method. The reddening values were determined as $E(B-V)=0.410\pm 0.046$ mag for Roslund 3 and $E(B-V)=0.615\pm 0.042$ mag for Ruprecht 174. The estimated distances are $d=1687 \pm 121$ pc for Roslund 3 and $d=2385 \pm 163$ pc for Ruprecht 174. Both clusters exhibit metallicities close to the solar value, with [Fe/H] = $0.030 \pm 0.065$ dex for Roslund 3 and [Fe/H] = $0.041 \pm 0.064$ dex for Ruprecht 174. The corresponding ages were found to be $\tau=60\pm 6$ and $\tau=520\pm 50$ Myr, respectively. The present day mass function slopes were found to be $1.18 \pm 0.13$ for Roslund 3 and $1.53 \pm 0.30$ for Ruprecht 174, consistent with the canonical Salpeter value within uncertainties. Galactic orbital analyses indicate that both clusters are thin-disk members confined within the Solar circle. Additionally, relaxation times and spatial distributions of stars suggest that both clusters have reached dynamical relaxation and exhibit clear signs of mass segregation.</description>

      <title>On the ages of the stellar populations of galaxies at $z=0.1$-7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>The properties of X-ray selected AGN in protoclusters pinpointed by Enormous Lya Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoclusters of galaxies are overdense regions of the Universe characterized by large gas reservoirs. Such environments make them perfect laboratories to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution and the growth of SMBHs. Galaxies living in such a dense regions are expected to growth efficiently their SMBH, resulting in a higher incidence of AGN than in the field. Some protoclusters exhibit extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in their central region, pinpointing the presence of massive gas reservoirs, but whose main powering mechanism is still debated. We aim to investigate the AGN population, and AGN enhancement, in three protoclusters at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 which host enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Additionally, we search for the presence of X-ray diffuse emission in the same region of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae to reveal multi-phase gas in these protoclusters. We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN among the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive the properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density with those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field environment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each structure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN. The fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other protoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift clusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with respect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally, we find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus ruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: Temperatures of Nine Highly Magnified Stars in a Galaxy at Redshift z = 0.94 and Simulated Stellar Population Dependence on Stellar Metallicity and the Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for {\alpha}&gt;1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (&lt;2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: A Candidate Massive Binary Star System in a Lensed Galaxy at Redshift 0.94</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed mu ~ 1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z = 0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T &gt; 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the projected source-plane size to R &lt; 270 AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperatures and luminosities of each star are stars with initial masses M1 = 22.5+7.1-5.5 Msun and an initial mass ratio very close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of ~50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.</description>

      <title>Testing Photometric Techniques for Measuring the Rest-Frame UV Spectral Slope Against JWST PRISM Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', $\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through three methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring $\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.</description>

      <title>Earliest Galaxy Evolution in the CANUCS+Technicolor fields: Galaxy Properties at $z\sim10-16$ seen with the Full NIRCam Medium and Broad Band Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of $z_{\rm phot}\sim10-16$ galaxies by exploiting one of the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over $\sim23\ {\rm arcmin}^2$ in three independent lines of sight. We select high-$z$ galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at $z\sim10-16$, including a very robust candidate at $z\sim15.4$. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of $\sim0.6$ dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at $z&gt;10$. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at $z&gt;10$, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of $\sim7$ from $z\sim11$ to $z\sim15$, indicating less steep evolution than $z&lt;11$. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-$z$ interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at $z&gt;10$, including the UV LF by $\sim0.6$ dex, the size-magnitude relation by $\sim0.6$ dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by $\Delta\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-0.3$.</description>

      <title>Jellyfish Galaxies in Magnetic Fields: Insights from Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies provide direct evidence of ram pressure stripping in cluster environments. We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the formation of jellyfish galaxies with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) using radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We impose magnetized (MHD) and non-magnetized (HD) winds on the gas-rich dwarf galaxies containing the magnetized or non-magnetized ISM. The MHD winds strip the disk gas more effectively than the HD winds because of the magnetic force acting against the local density gradient, which results in remarkably different ram pressure stripped features. The magnetic fields induced by the MHD winds generate a strong magnetic pressure, which forms smoothed disks and tail gas features. Since the stripped ISM in MHD wind cases travels while being nearly isolated from the intracluster medium (ICM), the stripped ISM mostly forms stars within 20~kpc of the galactic disks. In contrast, non-magnetized winds facilitate the efficient mixing of the stripped ISM with the ICM, resulting in the formation of abundant warm clouds that cool and collapse in the distant ($\sim50-100\,$kpc) tails at times of a few hundred Myr. Consequently, distant tail star formation occurs only in the HD wind runs. Finally, despite the different tail features, the star formation rates in the disk remain similar owing to the interplay between the increased gas stripping and the gas density increase in the disks of the MHD wind runs. These results suggest that the magnetized ICM may have a significant influence on jellyfish galaxies, whereas the magnetized ISM play a minor role.</description>

      <title>Identifying the contributors to cosmic reionization with the Habitable World Observatory: LyC escape calibration in faint galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating how small-scale physical processes shape large-scale astrophysical phenomena is one of the key science themes of the Astro2020 decadal Survey. An example of this interplay is Cosmic Reionization, where ionizing photons from galaxies escaped into the intergalactic medium (IGM), driving its transition from neutral to ionized at $z&gt;6$. Star-forming galaxies are thought to be the dominant sources of reionization. However, an open question remains as to whether bright or faint star-forming galaxies are the primary reionization contributors. This depends on the escape fraction $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ -- the fraction of ionizing photons that successfully escape the galaxy's interstellar and circumgalactic medium to reach the IGM. Performing direct measurements of $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ during the reionization epoch is not feasible, due to the near-zero transmission of the IGM at $z\gtrsim4$. However, by calibrating $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ against indirect indicators (i.e. galaxy properties that correlate with $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$) at lower $z$, we can estimate its value in galaxies during reionization. Currently, $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations are mostly limited to $\sim 90$ sources brighter $M_{UV} \sim -18$ at $z\sim0.3$. Yet, recent models suggest that fainter galaxies ($-19&lt;M_{UV}&lt;-13$) may be the major contributors to reionization. Our science goal is to extend $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations to such faint magnitudes. With the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we aim to achieve a $\sim$ 20-fold increase in statistical power. Additionally, we plan to reach magnitudes as faint as 1/100 $L^*$ at $z\sim0.1$. Suitable targets will be selected from the upcoming Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) survey. Through this science case, we will be able to place robust constraints on the role of faint galaxies in the reionization of the Universe and identify its primary contributors.</description>

      <title>What Sets the Metallicity of Ultra-Faint Dwarfs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\ge-4$. When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V&lt;-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\lesssim\eta_{\rm max}\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\eta_{\rm max}$. We find that all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity measurements.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Ionized Gas Filaments in Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase filamentary nebulae are ubiquitous in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of cool-core clusters, providing key insights into the cycle of baryons and the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. However, BCGs account for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our understanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to the greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are outside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE IFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in 54 of them. 35 out of 54 display rotating disks that are morphologically and kinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass loss as the origin of their warm gas. The remaining 19 host filamentary nebulae that are decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in BCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that cannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch stars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks. For the eight filamentary sources that have been observed with Chandra, their soft X-ray emission indicates the presence of hot gas. We posit that their emission lines may be powered by EUV and X-ray radiation from the cooling of the hot gas, similar to cool-core clusters, but the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may be different. As a detailed study case, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG with extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over pressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite with what is observed in cool-core clusters.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Concerning the Two Shock Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the shock physics and the treatment of radiative transfer in two well-established shock codes -- the MAPPINGS code (Dopita1976,Binette1985,Sutherland1993) and the Cox/Raymond code (hereafter CR code) (Cox1972,Raymond1976,Raymond1979). We compare the ionization states, temperatures, electron densities, and the energy transportation of the shock models with shock velocities of 50, 110, 150 and 300 km/s. In summary, both codes adopt the Rankine-Hugoniot flow equation to describe the shock flows, giving the same shock physical properties at the immediate area behind shock fronts. The different treatments of radiative transfer in these two codes leads to somewhat different computation of the ionization and thermal structures of shocks, as well as the emission-line fluxes. This work highlights the importance of the delicate treatment of photoionization in shock models, providing insight of the future development of shock codes, such as the 3D shock codes.</description>

      <title>Crowded Field Photometry with Rubin: Exploring 47 Tucanae with Data Preview 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze imaging from Data Preview 1 of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to explore the performance of early LSST pipelines in the 47 Tucanae field. The coadd-\texttt{object} catalog demonstrates the depth and precision possible with Rubin, recovering well-defined color magnitude diagrams for 47 Tuc Small Magellanic Cloud. Unfortunately, the existing pipelines fail to recover sources within $\sim$28 pc of the cluster center, due to the extreme source density. Using Rubin's forced photometry on stars identified via Difference Imaging, we can recover sources down to $\sim$14 pc from the cluster center, and find 14744 potential cluster members with this extended dataset. While this forced photometry has significant systematics, our analysis showcases the potential for detailed structural studies of crowded fields with the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Predictions with a Neural Network for DESI Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate redshift measurements are essential for studying the evolution of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and their role in cosmic structure formation. While spectroscopic redshifts provide high precision, they are impractical for the vast number of sources detected in large-scale surveys. Photometric redshifts, derived from broadband fluxes, offer an efficient alternative, particularly when combined with machine learning techniques. In this work, we develop and evaluate a neural network model for predicting the redshifts of QSOs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release spectroscopic catalogue, using photometry from DESI, the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Galactic Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We compare the performance of the neural network model against a k-Nearest Neighbours approach, these being the most accurate and least resource-intensive of the methods trialled herein, optimising model parameters and assessing accuracy with standard statistical metrics. Our results show that incorporating ultraviolet photometry from GALEX improves photometric redshift estimates, reducing scatter and catastrophic outliers compared to models trained only on near infrared and optical bands. The neural network achieves a correlation coefficient with spectroscopic redshift of $0.9187$ with normalised median absolute deviation of $0.197$, representing a significant improvement over other methods. Our work combines DESI, WISE and GALEX measurements, providing robust predictions which address the difficulties in predicting photometric redshift of QSOs over a large redshift range.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism of radio-quiet turn-on changing-look active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is suggested that the variation of mass accretion rate in accretion disk may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that $t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs, which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with $t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}&lt;t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can indeed happen before the second observation.</description>

      <title>FEAST: probing the stellar population of the starburst dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial distributions shows that younger (&lt; 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 - 60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy. These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in nearby starburst systems.</description>

      <title>LMC-induced Perturbations in the Milky Way Halo:I. HaloDance Simulation Suite and Observational Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) perturbs the MW halo's density and kinematics, encoding information about both galaxies' masses and structures. We present a suite of 2,848 high-resolution ($10^7$ particles) N-body simulations that systematically vary the mass and shape of both galaxies' haloes. We model how the mean velocities and velocity dispersions of halo stars (30--120 kpc) depend on system parameters, and forecast constraints achievable with current and future observations. Assuming Gaia DR3-level astrometry, 20 km/s radial velocity precision, 10% distance precision, and a sample of $\sim$4,000 RR Lyrae stars, we achieve 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.11 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ in MW mass, $2.33 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ in LMC mass, 2.38 in halo concentration ($c$), and 0.06 in halo flattening ($q$). These correspond to fractional uncertainties of 11%, 16%, 25%, and 6% respectively, relative to fiducial values. Improved Gaia proper motions (DR5) yield modest gains (up to 14%), while adding radial velocities improves constraints by up to 60% relative to using Gaia astrometry alone. Doubling the sample size to $\sim$8,000 stars yields an additional 30% improvement, whereas reducing distance uncertainties has minimal impact ($\le$10%). Mean velocities trace LMC-induced perturbations, while velocity dispersions constrain MW halo properties, jointly breaking degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that combining Gaia astrometry with large spectroscopic surveys will enable precise characterization of the MW-LMC system. This methodology paper establishes the framework for interpreting observations; future work will apply these tools to existing spectroscopic datasets. The full simulation suite, HaloDance, will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/Yanjun-Sheng/HaloDance.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectra of Brown Dwarf Candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present an analysis of archival spectra of 200 sources toward the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) that were obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I have used these data to assess cluster membership and measure spectral types for the targets. Fifty-three sources are classified as likely cluster members, 24 of which have spectral types that are suggestive of brown dwarfs ($&gt;$M6). Seven of the NIRSpec targets were previously identified as "Jupiter-mass binary objects" (JuMBOs), all of which are background sources rather than brown dwarfs based on the NIRSpec data. The spectral classifications of those objects are consistent with the results of my recent study of the JWST photometry in the ONC, which found that only a few JuMBO components have the colors expected for brown dwarfs, none of which form pairs that have uniquely wide separations or low masses relative to known binary brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The late Miocene $^{10}$Be anomaly and the possibility of a supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Deep Potential: Recovering the gravitational potential and local pattern speed in the solar neighborhood with GDR3 using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy. Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of $\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of $\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and non-stationarity in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Assessing the hierarchical dynamical state of molecular gas: virial parameters from 3 to 300 pc in NGC 253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars. To this end, we present ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$) region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.</description>

      <title>Mapping Galactic Winds and Small-scale Structure in the Circumgalactic Medium with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to map the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission by targeting ultraviolet emission lines, which trace the 10^4 - 10^6 K gas engaged in the feedback and accretion mechanisms driving galaxy evolution. While the CGM-galaxy connection is clearly evident through absorption line experiments and limited work done in optical and radio emission from the ground, the nature of this connection is poorly understood with regard to how these cosmic ecosystems exchange matter and energy. We outline a two-pronged experiment with Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) utilizing both multi-object spectroscopy to map kpc-scale CGM structures such as galactic superwinds and integral field spectroscopy to unveil the sub-kpc-scale processes such as thermal instabilities, which are theorized to govern the cool gas reservoirs long detected in pencil-beam absorption surveys. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed by HWO's CGM/IGM Working Group.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Tidal Forces in Molecular Cloud Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of tidal forces in molecular cloud formation by examining how apparent boundedness, as diagnosed by the classical virial parameter, relates to the actual gravitational state of clouds subject to tidal forces from their environment. Clouds are identified by a dendrogram algorithm in zoom-in regions taken from a simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with the Voronoi mesh code AREPO that resolves star-forming regions at sub-parsec resolution. To look at a range of environments, we use data from three different regions that evolve differently in the center, near the equivalent of the Solar circle, and the outskirts of the modeled galaxy, at three different times, each spaced 2 Myr apart. We compute the importance of tidal forces on all identified clouds. We then compare the boundedness of clouds including only their internal potentials to boundedness also including the external gravitational potential. This comparison shows that tidal forces can unbind apparently bound clouds and bind apparently unbound clouds. We characterize the cloud population by comparing their virial parameters to their surface densities, finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalues of the tidal tensor, and determining the strength of gravitational instability in each examined region. We find that it is necessary to take the total gravitational potential into account rather than just the internal self-gravity of the clouds to have an accurate understanding of cloud dynamics.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic-ray propagation on the chemistry and ionisation fraction of dark clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper modelling of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within gas clouds is crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about 10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.</description>

      <title>The virial factor $f$ of the H$\beta$ Broad-line for NGC 5548 and NGC 4151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of virial factor $f$ is investigated for two active galactic nucleus, NGC 5548 and NGC 4151, which had been previously reverberation mapped (RM) over 20 times in the past 30 years. Using four velocity tracers from the broad H$\beta$ width at half-maximum ($\rm FWHM_{\rm H\beta} $) or the line dispersion from the mean or rms spectra, $f$ for each RM epoch are calculated. Significant correlations are found between $f$ and observational parameters, such as the broad line widths, the Eddington ratios and the line profile shapes. For NGC 5548, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-0.70\pm0.13}$ and for NGC 4151, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-3.31\pm0.59}$. This suggests that a variable $f$ should be included to weight the virial SMBH mass. Using a simple model of thick-disc broad line regions (BLRs), we show that changes in mean inclination can explain $f$ variation. The inclination range is $14.1-40.6$ deg for NGC 5548 and $14.0-55.1$ deg for NGC 4151. Modeling the light curves of $f$ with a damped random walk process yields mean timescales of 638 and 668 days, consistent with BLR dynamical timescales within uncertainties. This indicates that $f$ variations are linked to BLR dynamics, likely due to changes in geometry or inclination.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Growth of Little Red Dot Descendants at z&lt;4 with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z&lt;4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single S\'ersic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with $M_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M_\odot $, central densities ($ \Sigma_\ast \sim 10^{11} \ M_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $ \sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 &lt; z &lt; 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.</description>

      <title>From the Densest Clusters to the Emptiest Voids: No Evidence For Environmental Effects on the Galaxy Size-Mass Relation at Low Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the galaxy size-stellar mass relation (SMR) at low redshift (z &lt;= 0.125), using a large spectroscopic sample from the SDSS-DR13 survey. Our goal is to investigate how environment affects galaxy structural properties across multiple spatial scales. Galaxies are classified by specific star formation rate, optical color, and bulge-to-total light ratio, allowing us to disentangle environmental effects from intrinsic galaxy properties. We examine the SMR in three contexts: (1) comparing galaxy sizes in two extreme environments-dense clusters versus cosmic voids; (2) analyzing cluster galaxies across a range of cluster masses; and (3) studying member galaxies located in different cluster regions, from the core to the infall zone. In all three cases, we find no significant dependence of the SMR on environment at fixed stellar mass and galaxy type. Cluster and void galaxies follow consistent SMR trends, and no measurable variation is observed with cluster mass or cluster-centric distance. We also confirm that early-type galaxies exhibit steeper SMR slopes than late types. Notably, this consistent lack of environmental dependence on the SMR persists even when accounting for the differing galaxy number densities in voids, supporting the universality of this SMR scaling relation across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>A gravitational acceleration model to explain the double-peaked narrow emission lines shifted in the same direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose, for the first time, an oversimplified but potentially effective gravitational acceleration model to interpret the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) shifted in the same direction. We adopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical orbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs) merging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to gravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of the far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction when projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed DPNELs to shift in the same direction. Our simulations indicate that the probability of producing double-peaked features shifted in the same direction reaches 5.81% in merging kpc-scale dual core systems containing emission-line galaxies. Besides the expected results from our proposed model, we identify a unique galaxy SDSS J001050.52-103246.6, whose apparent DPNELs shifted in the same direction can be plausibly explained by the gravitational acceleration model. This proposed model provides a new path to explain DPNELs shifted in the same direction in the scenario that the two galaxies align along the line-of-sight in kpc-scale dual-core systems.</description>

      <title>Interband Lag Variability in Active Galactic Nuclei across ZTF Data from Multiple Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interband lags in the optical continua of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed over years of monitoring, yet their physical origins remain unclear. While variable interband lags have been found in a few individual AGN potentially, the temporal behavior of interband lags of an AGN sample has not been explored systematically. Here, we analyze the interband lags of 94 bright AGN at $z&lt;0.8$, using both seasonal one-year and full six-year $gri$-band light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 22. We find that more than half of 94 AGN show significant seasonal variations in the interband lags. Besides, the short-term lags, derived by averaging lags inferred from multiple seasonal light curves, are consistently smaller than the long-term lags, which are inferred from the full six-year light curves. This supports recent theoretical simulations where the lag measurement is sensitive to the baseline of light curve and the lag variation could be simply attributed to the inherent randomness of AGN variability. Our findings suggest that the interband lags of AGN are more complex and stochastic than commonly thought, and highlight the importance of high-precision time-domain surveys in uncovering the properties of AGN variability as well as the associated accretion physics.</description>

      <title>Extreme cloud collisions in nearby barred galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of the Milky Way are known to contain an enigmatic population of prominent molecular clouds characterised by extremely broad lines. The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is still debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic bar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in the dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey. We aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of the external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample of 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the remaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of the EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few hundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly out-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme cloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly non-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with previous high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of this interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared observations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas that appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found. We argue that EVFs are the clearest examples of cloud-cloud collisions available in literature and represent a unique opportunity to study cloud collisions and their impact on star formation.</description>

      <title>Deep neutral hydrogen observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 2768: collided by a newly discovered satellite galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1 x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV) diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted, indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC 2768.</description>

      <title>The SEDs of very long-period cepheids in the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, M31 and M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33 (classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess.
  The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the literature.
  WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess emission was related to the central objects.
  Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii} Cepheid.
  The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the instability strip.
  For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can significantly change their position in the HRD.</description>

      <title>Statistical nuclear spin ratios of deuterated ammonia in the pre-stellar core L1544</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determined the ortho/para (o/p) ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.</description>

      <title>First detection of Circular Polarization in radio continuum towards a Massive Protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on magnetic fields in star-forming systems. While magnetic field estimates of a few kiloGauss (kG) have been obtained near the surface of low-mass protostars, there are no analogous measurements in the immediate vicinity of the surface of massive protostars. We report the measurement of radio continuum circular polarization (CP) towards a massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048 for the first time wielding Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The fractional CP varies between $3-5\%$ across the observed frequency range of $4-6$ GHz. We consider multiple hypotheses for the production of CP and propose (i) gyrosynchrotron emission and (ii) Faraday conversion due to turbulence in the magnetic medium - both driven by mildly relativistic electrons as plausible mechanisms. We estimate, for the first time, a magnetic field $B\gtrsim20-35$ G close to the massive protostar. The Lorentz factor of the low energy electrons is estimated to be in the range $\gamma_{min}\sim5-7$ for gyrosynchrotron emission and $80-100$ for Faraday conversion from our observations. The magnetic field estimate can provide important constraints to the formation models of massive stars.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization. Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs. At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts, Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that shape galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters initially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile is consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly ejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends on the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall star formation timescale.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. %
Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>

      <title>Mass Proxy Quality of Massive Halo Properties in the IllustrisTNG and FLAMINGO Simulations: I. Hot Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} &gt; 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Milky Way Halo Accretion History With Simulated Stellar Halos: Designing the HALO7D-X Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design for HALO7D-X, a survey of the stellar halo to investigate the accretion history of the Milky Way. The survey will use a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Gaia data for sky position and proper motions of faint stars (18&lt;G&lt;21.5 mag), while line-of-sight velocity, distance, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] will be measured using follow-up Keck spectroscopy. The survey will cover 30 lines of sight, made up of multiple HST archival fields and optimized for Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy. We use mock survey observations of the Bullock and Johnston stellar halo simulations to investigate the sensitivity of HALO7D-X to constrain the basic parameters of the accretion history of our Galaxy's stellar halo. We find that we are sensitive to the mass distribution and accretion timeline of the stellar halo progenitors, but not their orbital circularity. We find that the simulated halos fall into three different groups based on the similarities in their distributions of the observable dimensions of our survey. These groups are also distinct from each other in the mass distribution and accretion timeline of their progenitor satellites, showing that by using similarities in our observables among halos, we are able to identify similarities in their accretion histories. With HALO7D-X we will compare real Milky Way data with simulated halos and use this connection between observables and progenitor mass and accretion timeline to learn about the formation of our Galaxy's stellar halo.</description>

      <title>A High Resolution Search for Dual AGNs in Mergers: Pushing the Frontier with Keck AO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations $&lt;$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE colors ($W_1-W_2&gt;0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO) observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band ($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets. We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Halo Mass Prediction and the Cosmology-Dependence of Halo Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable, field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function (HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.</description>

      <title>Exploring the X-ray--radio connection for AGN via measurements of the multi-dimensional luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>

      <title>Radio Morphology of Gamma-ray Sources -- II. Giant Radio Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant radio sources, including galaxies and quasars (hereafter GRGs), are active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting relativistic jets with source sizes exceeding the projected length of 0.7 Mpc. They are crucial to understanding the evolution of radio sources and their interaction with the surrounding environment. Some of these enigmatic objects, e.g., NGC 315, have also been reported as gamma-ray emitters. Since GRGs are thought to be aligned close to the plane of the sky, they are invaluable targets to explore the radiative mechanisms responsible for the observed gamma-ray emission. We have carried out a systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution radio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth Fermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog. By carefully inspecting the radio maps of all AGN included in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, we have identified 16 gamma-ray emitting GRGs, including 8 of them being reported as GRGs for the first time. Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core dominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected GRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the gamma-ray emitting jet. The observed gamma-ray properties of these objects were found to be similar to non-GRG gamma-ray emitting misaligned AGN. We conclude that the origin of the gamma-ray emission could be similar in both source populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Very Massive Stars with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) are defined as stars with an initial mass in excess of 100 Msun. Because of their short lifetime and the shape of the stellar mass function, they are rare objects. Only about twenty of them are known in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. However VMS are important in several ways. They efficiently spread nucleosynthesis products through their boosted stellar winds, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability supernovae or to form heavy black-holes from direct collapse, and they outshine all other types of stars in the ultraviolet light, thus dominating the integrated light of starbursts. Their presence is indirectly suspected across all redshifts, all the way to cosmic dawn where they may have played a key role in the formation of the first galaxies. Their search and identification is currently hampered by instrumental limitation, especially spatial resolution. An integral field spectrograph working at the diffraction limit of HWO (5mas) and with a spectral resolution of about 2000 would revolutionize the understanding of VMS. We make the case for such an instrument in this contribution.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF IX -- The Cosmic Optical and Infrared Background from Integrated Galaxy Light Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 \deg^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 \deg^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The physical properties of candidate neutrino-emitter blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data, which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall, the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields, typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them, 24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and the sample size.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess an entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon, introducing the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking initially objected to this idea, but his subsequent analysis of quantum field theory in curved spacetime led to the prediction of Hawking radiation and the concept of black hole temperature. This study offers a concise overview of the development of black hole thermodynamics between 1972 and 1975, highlighting the theoretical evolution of both Bekenstein's and Hawking's contributions. The work also reflects on the lasting impact of these developments on modern theoretical physics and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p &lt; 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.</description>

      <title>A Search for Millimeter-Bright Blazars as Astrophysical Neutrino Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide exceptional conditions for neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma=1$. We derive both the exact formula for the periapsis shift of a quasi-circular orbit and the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We show that the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime for $1/11 &lt; \gamma \leq 1/5$ is the same as in the Schwarzschild spacetime to the 2PN order if $e=\sqrt{(\gamma^{-1}-5)/6}$, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. Furthermore, we show that the parameter $\gamma$ and the corresponding quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$ of the supermassive compact object at Sagittarius A* are constrained to $\gamma \gtrsim 1.7 \times 10^{-2}$ and $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^3$, respectively, from observational data on S2 using the obtained PN expansion formula. Finally, we derive a new series representation for the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime but also for small eccentricity.</description>

Abstract: We present stationary and axially-symmetric black hole solutions to the Einstein field equations sourced by an anisotropic fluid, describing rotating black holes embedded in astrophysical environments. We compute their physical properties, including quantities associated with the circular geodesics of massless and massive particles, analyze their shadows and image features, and energy conditions. Overall, we find that deviations from the Kerr metric grow with spin.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the "classical" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.</description>

      <title>The EoR 21-cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data I: Foregrounds and preliminary upper limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the $z = 8.2$ Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm bispectrum (BS) using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ data. We find that $B(k_{1\perp}, k_{2\perp}, k_{3\perp}, k_{1\parallel}, k_{2\parallel})$ the 3D cylindrical BS exhibits a foreground wedge, similar to $P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However, the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$, $(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (1.81\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.008~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (2.04\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.012~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral and squeezed triangles, respectively. These are foreground-dominated, and are many orders of magnitude larger than the predicted EoR 21-cm signal $(\sim 10^3 ~\mathrm{mK}^3)$.</description>

      <title>A portrait throughout perihelion of the NH$_2$-rich interstellar comet 2I/Borisov</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 2I/Borisov is the first interstellar object where compositional characterisation was possible throughout its entire perihelion passage. We report all 16 epochs of a comprehensive optical observation campaign with ESO VLT's integral field spectrograph MUSE, spanning 126 days from 2019 November 14 to 2020 March 19. The spatial dust emission of 2I/Borisov was predominantly smooth, with no seasonal effect. A jet-like feature was consistently visible. The gas production morphology of its coma was also smooth and similar for C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN: symmetric around the photocentre. The production rates of these species gently declined into and beyond perihelion, until 2I's outburst and splitting event in early 2020 March. C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN production rates all increased, with NH$_2$ being the most significant; the dust emission also slightly reddened. 2I/Borisov is a carbon-depleted, relatively NH$_2$-rich comet when compared to those comets yet measured in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo radiation hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven disc winds: relaxing the isothermal approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism. However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed, multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc &lt; 1e-5 for our adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4). One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow. In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven disc winds in AGN.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Objects and their disks with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) are known to harbor disks at young ages. Here, we present 1-13 $\mu m$ spectra for eight young FFPMOs with masses of 5-10 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ (at ages of 1-5 Myr), using the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. We derive fundamental properties of these targets, and find spectral types of M9.5 to L4, with effective temperatures of 1600-1900 K. The photospheric spectra of our targets show a clear diversity at similar temperatures, especially in the 3-5 $\mu m$ range, unaccounted for by existing atmospheric models. We find a silicate absorption feature in the photosphere of one of our targets, the first such detection in very young FFPMOs, indicating silicate clouds in their cool atmospheres. Six of our objects show mid-infrared excess emission above the photosphere, as well as silicate emission features, demonstrating the presence of disks. The shape and strength of the latter features constitute strong evidence of grain growth and crystallization, similar to what is seen in more massive brown dwarfs and stars. We also detect emission lines from hydrocarbon molecules in the disks of several targets. These are the lowest mass isolated objects found so far with silicate and hydrocarbon emission features arising in their disks. The presence of disks and their characteristics point to the potential for the formation of rocky companions around free-floating planetary-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Initial VLT/MUSE spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on 2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth. These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~\AA, redder than most Solar System comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: discovery and physical description</title>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02 mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that \textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>Dust attenuation evolution in $z \sim 2$-$12$ JWST galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sizable fraction of the heavy elements synthesized by stars in galaxies condenses into sub-micron-sized solid-state particles, known as dust grains. Dust produces a wavelength-dependent attenuation, $A_\lambda$, of the galaxy emission, thereby significantly altering its observed properties. Locally, $A_\lambda$ is in general the sum of a power-law and a UV feature ('bump') produced by small, carbon-based grains. However, scant information exists regarding its evolution across cosmic time. Here, leveraging data from 173 galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the redshift range z = 2 - 12, we report the most distant detection of the UV bump in a z ~ 7.55 galaxy (when the Universe was only ~ 700 Myr old), and show for the first time that the power-law slope and the bump strength decrease towards high redshifts. We propose that the flat $A_\lambda$ shape at early epochs is produced by large grains newly formed in supernova ejecta, which act as the main dust factories at such early epochs. Importantly, these grains have undergone minimal reprocessing in the interstellar medium due to the limited available cosmic time. This discovery opens new perspectives in the study of cosmic dust origin and evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the High Star-Formation Efficiency in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the early excess of bright galaxies seen by JWST, we run zoom-in cosmological simulations of a massive galaxy at Cosmic Dawn, in a halo of $10^{11} M_\odot$ at $z = 9$, using the hydro-gravitational code RAMSES at an effective resolution $\sim 10~{\rm pc}$. We investigate physical mechanisms that enhance the star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) at the high gas densities of the star-forming regions in this galaxy ($\sim 3\times 10^3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, $\sim 10^4~M_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$). Our fiducial star formation recipe uses a physically-motivated, turbulence-based, multi-freefall model, avoiding ad hoc extrapolation from lower redshifts. By $z = 9$, our simulated galaxy is a clumpy, thick, rotating disc with a high stellar mass $\sim 3\times 10^9~M_\odot$ and high star formation rate $\sim 50~M_\odot/{\rm yr}$. The high gas density makes supernova (SN) feedback less efficient, producing a high local SFE $\gtrsim 10\%$. The global SFE is set by feedback-driven outflows and only weakly correlated with the local SFE. Photoionization heating makes SN feedback more efficient, but the integrated SFE always remains high. Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds turbulence which reduces local SFE, but this only weakly affects the global SFE. The star formation histories of our simulated galaxies are similar to observed massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, despite our limited resolution. We set the stage for future simulations which treat radiation self-consistently and use a higher effective resolution $\sim 1~{\rm pc}$ that captures the physics of star-forming clouds.</description>

      <title>RR Lyrae Stars in Intermediate-age Magellanic Clusters: Membership Probabilities and Delay Time Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as tracers of exclusively old populations ($\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a fraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is currently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars, our goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age clusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We used the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search for RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion and photometric distance we obtained a list of 259 RRL stars associated with Magellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age clusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By modelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per cluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age ranges. For the old population ($&gt;8$~Gyr) we find $2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we find rates of $0.34^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ and $0.071^{+0.073}_{-0.041}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$, respectively, after further decontamination from control field tests. While radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster memberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented here offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,\msun$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,\msun$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates have become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,\msun\,\yr^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,\myr$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,\msun$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs from gas with surface densities $\gtrsim10^3\,\msun\,\pc^{-2}$ and that nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are dominated by EMS-rich GCs that formed in the earliest phases of galaxy formation. These EMSs may have left behind intermediate-mass black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,\msun$) that could be found with ongoing gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration Survey. V. The Magnetic Field Strength and Morphology in the Sagittarius C Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the magnetic field strength and morphology in the Sagittarius C complex (Sgr C; G359.43-0.09) in the Milky Way Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using the 214 $\mu$m polarimetry data acquired with the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) instrument aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We conduct a modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis of individual clouds and find that the sky-plane magnetic field strength varies from highly turbulent regions having inferred strengths of $\sim30~\mu{\rm G}$ to regions of relatively uniform field orientation having strengths of $\sim 300~\mu{\rm G}$. Several hundred magnetic field pseudovectors in the Sgr C region were measured to trace the projected magnetic field orientation within cold molecular clouds, and as is the trend throughout the CMZ, they show a higher polarization fraction toward the periphery of the clouds. The magnetic field orientations suggest that outflows from active star-forming regions, such as the G359.43-0.10 extended green object (EGO) and the protostellar source FIR-4 (G359.43+0.02), cause high turbulence in their vicinity. The magnetic field direction is found to be tangential to the surface of the Sgr C HII region, which displays spatial correspondence with two [CII] emission cavities reported in the HII region, signifying a compression front between the HII region and the surrounding dense clouds. Several other features in the vicinity of Sgr C, especially numerous non-thermal radio filaments (NTFs) and a diffuse source of X-ray emission to the immediate southwest of the HII region, are discussed with regard to the magnetic field measurements.</description>

      <title>Low redshift post-starburst galaxies host abundant HI reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the gas content of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies can provide valuable clues regarding the process of fast quenching. Although previous works have studied the molecular gas content of PSBs, only a handful of HI measurements exist. Here, we present new Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 21cm observations of 44 PSBs, leading to 43 detections or sensitive upper limits of HI, which we combine with 25 archival measurements, for a total sample of 68 PSB MHI measurements. HI is detected in 57/68 galaxies, with HI masses ranging from MHI ~10^8.5 up to 10^10 Msun and gas fractions (fHI = MHI/M*) from a few percent up to almost 30 percent. Post-starbursts therefore retain ample atomic gas reservoirs, despite no longer forming stars. By comparing with a stellar mass-matched sample of star-forming galaxies in xGASS, we find that PSBs have, on average, gas fractions lower by ~0.2-0.4 dex, consistent with a mild reduction compared with their progenitor population. However, PSBs show a diversity of HI properties; about half have HI gas masses within the expected scatter of the star-forming population with the remaining 50 per cent up to a factor of 10 more gas-poor. Compared with galaxies in the green valley, about two thirds of PSBs have gas fractions within the expected range, with the remaining third up to a factor of 10 more gas-rich. Our results demonstrate that quenching in PSBs is not the result of wholesale removal of the atomic gas reservoir and that the population has atomic gas fractions that span the range from star-forming to green valley galaxies. We find no correlation between HI gas mass and time since burst; even galaxies a Gyr past their burst can remain HI-normal. The significant gas reservoirs remaining in many PSBs leaves open the possibility for future rekindling of star formation.</description>

      <title>Extended Enriched Gas in a Multi-Galaxy Merger at Redshift 6.7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered high-redshift galaxies characterized by multiple star-forming clumps, many of which appear to be undergoing mergers. Such mergers, especially those of two galaxies with equivalent masses, play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution and regulating the chemical composition of their environments. Here, we report a major merger of at least five galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the JWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area $\sim4.5''\times4.5''$ ($24.6\times24.6$ pkpc$^2$), containing over 17 galaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of $10^{10}\ M_\odot$. The JQ system has a total star formation rate of 240 -- 270 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, placing it $\sim1$ dex above the median star formation rate-mass main sequence at this epoch. The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are consistent with the star formation history of those unexpected massive quiescent galaxies observed at redshift 4-5, offering a plausible evolutionary pathway for the formation of such galaxies. We also detect a large [O III]+H$\beta$ emitting gaseous halo surrounding and connecting four galaxies in the JQ, suggesting the existence of heavy elements in the surrounding medium -- inner part of its circumgalactic medium (CGM). This provides direct evidence for the metal enrichment of galaxies' environments through merger-induced tidal stripping, just 800 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The Three-mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey. III. Data Release 6, An Atlas of Physical Conditions, Global Mass Conversion Laws, and 3D Physical Architecture of the Molecular ISM in the Fourth Quadrant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Data Release 6 of ThrUMMS, consisting of complete data cubes and various moments of line emission ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) from molecular clouds, across 60$^{\circ}$$\times$2$^{\circ}$ of the Fourth Quadrant (4Q) of the Milky Way at a resolution of 72$''$ in (l,b) and 0.09 kms$^{-1}$ in V$_{LSR}$. From LTE radiative transfer analysis of the data cubes, we compute cubes and moments of the lines' opacity, excitation temperature, and column density $N_{12CO}$. Combining $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$ data, we derive a global mass conversion law $N$=$N_{0}I^{p}$, where $N_{0}$$\approx$10$^{18}$mol/m$^{2}$ and $p$=2 at this resolution. We argue that the standard linear $N$=$XI$ is only approximately valid: $p$$\sim$1.5-1.0 at coarser resolutions or in atypical locations, such as Galactic Center clouds. Also, the velocity dispersion distributions are very different between $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$, the former preferentially tracing more diffuse molecular gas. We re-evaluated Galactic rotation parameters for the 4Q, defining a new ``BGT'' model, and deprojected the (l,V) data onto (l,d) and (x,y) grids using standard kinematic procedures. To automate distance disambiguation inside the solar circle, we developed a simple $\zeta^{+}$ discriminator function and applied it to our deprojections. We discovered two previously unrecognised features of the molecular cloud population: widespread ripples in the midplane of wavelength 4kpc and amplitude 50pc, potentially generated by the last perigalactic passage of the Sgr dwarf; and three distant, massive molecular structures, the Far Ara clouds, two of which exhibit an exceptional velocity gradient, possibly lying in the far end of the Galaxy's Bar or a gas-rich dwarf galaxy $\sim$20-300 kpc beyond the disk</description>

      <title>A High-Caliber View of the Bullet Cluster Through JWST Strong and Weak Lensing Analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin$^{-2}$) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of $19.80 \pm 12.46$ kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.</description>

      <title>Describing the Nonuniversal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations between X-ray clusters and the general galaxy population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents highly precise measurements of the cross-correlation between volume-limited galaxy samples from the DESI legacy survey catalogue and X-ray selected galaxy clusters from eROSITA, allowing for detailed analysis across redshift and color. Two key findings emerge. First, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation, when split into quiescent and star-forming galaxies, contains significant information about the infall, feedback, and quenching processes of blue cloud galaxies in massive environments. These results align well with existing galaxy evolution models for higher stellar masses ($\log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot]) &gt; 10.75$), though the red fraction may be slightly underestimated in the intermediate mass range ($10.25 &lt; \log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot])&lt; 10.75$). Second, the integral of the cross-correlation within 500 kpc enables a model-independent measurement of the red sequence and its scatter in clusters, providing a robust alternative to existing red-sequence calibration methods without requiring spectroscopic redshifts or classifications of galaxies. Similar analyses on upcoming photometric surveys like Euclid and LSST and spectroscopic samples like 4MOST and DESI should lead to a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly at small separations.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The radial acceleration relation with resolved stellar mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial acceleration relation (RAR) is a fundamental relation linking baryonic and dark matter in galaxies by relating the observed acceleration derived from dynamics to the one estimated from the baryonic mass. This relation exhibits small scatter, thus providing key constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution -- allowing us to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxies -- as well as models of modified dynamics. However, it has only been extensively studied in the very local Universe with largely heterogeneous samples. We present a new measurement of the RAR, utilising a homogeneous sample of 19 HI-selected galaxies out to $z=0.08$. We introduce a novel approach of measuring resolved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting across 10 photometric bands to determine the resolved mass-to-light ratio, which we show is essential for measuring the acceleration due to baryons in the low-acceleration regime. Our results reveal a tight RAR with a low-acceleration power-law slope of $\sim 0.5$, consistent with previous studies. Adopting a spatially varying mass-to-light ratio yields the tightest RAR with an intrinsic scatter of only $0.045 \pm 0.022$ dex, highlighting the importance of resolved stellar mass measurements in accurately characterising the gravitational contribution of the baryons in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. We also find the first tentative evidence for redshift evolution in the acceleration scale, but more data will be required to confirm this. Adopting a more general MOND interpolating function, we find that our results ameliorate the tension between previous RAR analyses, the Solar System quadrupole and wide-binary test.</description>

      <title>A New High-latitude H I Cloud Complex Entrained in the Northern Fermi Bubble</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of eleven high-velocity HI clouds at Galactic latitudes of 25-30 degrees, likely embedded in the Milky Way's nuclear wind. The clouds are detected with deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations of a $3.2^\circ \times 6.2^\circ$ field around QSO 1H1613-097, located behind the northern Fermi Bubble. Our measurements reach $3\sigma$ limits on $ N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ as low as $3.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, more than twice as sensitive as previous HI studies of the Bubbles. The clouds span $-180 \leq v_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq -90$ km/s and are the highest-latitude 21 cm HVCs detected inside the Bubbles. Eight clouds are spatially resolved, showing coherent structures with sizes of 4-28 pc, peak column densities of $\log(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^2) = 17.9\text{-}18.7$, and HI masses up to 1470 $M_\odot$. Several exhibit internal velocity gradients. Their presence at such high latitudes is surprising, given the short expected survival times for clouds expelled from the Galactic Center. These objects may be fragments of a larger cloud disrupted by interaction with the surrounding hot gas.</description>

      <title>XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of &lt; 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.</description>

      <title>AVID: Formation and evolution of a coalesced major merger of late-type dwarf galaxies (VCC 479) on the outskirts of the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf-dwarf galaxy mergers are among the least explored aspects of dwarf galaxy pre-processing as they fall into clusters. We present the first case study of a coalesced late-type dwarf major merger (VCC 479; stellar mass $\sim\,8\,\times\,10^7\,\rm M_\odot$) that has undergone significant environmental influence, with the aim of exploring dwarf galaxy evolution under the combined effects of galaxy interactions and environmental processes, and understanding its relevance to the diversity of dwarf galaxies in cluster environments. Our analysis is based on VLA and FAST HI emission line mapping from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) survey. We also perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers to help interpret the observations. We identify symmetric stellar shell structures in VCC 479, indicative of a coalesced major merger of dwarf galaxies. The galaxy features a central starburst, initiated $\sim$600 Myr ago, embedded within an exponential disk quenched $\sim$1 Gyr ago. The starburst contributes only 2.9$\pm$0.5\% of the total stellar mass, and VCC 479's global star formation rate is 0.3 dex lower than typical dwarfs of similar mass. The galaxy is highly HI deficient, with most HI gas concentrated within the central 1 kpc and little extended HI envelope. The misalignment of the HI velocity field with the stellar body is best explained by merger-triggered gas inflow, as seen in our simulations. Our analysis is consistent with a scenario that the majority of HI gas of the progenitor galaxies was removed by the cluster environment prior to the final coalescence. The merger concentrates the remaining gas toward the galaxy center, triggering a central starburst. The combined effect of environment stripping and galaxy merger has transformed VCC 479 into a blue-core dwarf undergoing morphological transition from a late-type to an early-type galaxy.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Star Formation and Black Hole Accretion Rates in Galaxy Mergers in IllustrisTNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star &gt; 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from $\textit{JWST}$.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the galaxy formation histories predicted by a neural network in pure dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark matter only cosmological simulations, using a semi-recurrent neural network producing self-consistent predictions of galaxy evolution, and using stochastic improvements to this model based on similarly predicted Fourier Transforms. We apply these methods to the dark matter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial for low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass progenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a high abundance of Classical Be (CBe) stars. CBe stars are main sequence non-supergiant B-type stars, which exhibit or have exhibited Balmer line emissions in their spectra. We perform a membership analysis using Gaia DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be ${3.6^{+1.0}_{-0.6}}$ kpc. We identify 499 Gaia-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.2 M$_\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.7%. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using Standard Deviation, Median Absolute Deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66% of CBe stars are variable: 23% show periodic signals, typical of pulsation/rotation, 41% display variability characteristic of disk dynamics or binarity, and 14% exhibit long-term changes, consistent with disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50% are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>Classification of Radio Sources Through Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The morphology of radio galaxies is indicative of their interaction with their surroundings, among other effects. Since modern radio surveys contain a large number of radio sources that would be impossible to analyse and classify manually, it is important to develop automatic schemes. Unlike other fields, which benefit from established theoretical frameworks and simulations, there are no such comprehensive models built for radio galaxies. This stands as a challenge to data analysis in this field and novel approaches are required. In this study, we investigate the classification of radio galaxies from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS-DR2) using self-supervised learning. Our deep clustering classification strategy involves three main steps: (i) self-supervised pre-training; (ii) fine-tuning using a labelled subsample created from the learned representations; and (iii) performing a final classification of the selected unlabelled sample. To enhance morphological information in the representations, we developed an additional random augmentation, called a random structural view (RSV). Our results demonstrate that the learned representations contain rich morphological information, enabling the creation of a labelled subsample that effectively captures the morphological diversity within the unlabelled sample. Additionally, the classification of the unlabelled sample into 12 morphological classes yields robust class probabilities. We successfully demonstrated that a subset of radio galaxies from LoTSS-DR2, encompassing diverse morphologies, can be classified using deep clustering based on self-supervised learning. The methodology developed here bridges the gap left by the absence of simulations and theoretical models, offering a framework that can readily be applied to astronomical image analyses in other bands.</description>

      <title>The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is influenced by gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ group and a $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ cluster at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus and their connection to feedback mechanisms. This set-up uses the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolutions, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ for dark matter. We find that, when halos reach the characteristic mass of $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition from supernova to AGN feedback-driven regulation. As halos grow into groups ($\sim 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$), the entropy plateau extends inward and isentropic cores form in massive systems ($\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$). By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is primarily driven by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before falling into the core. Recent observations of X-GAP groups reveal large entropy excesses and plateaus, in line with our findings and in contrast to the power-law-like profiles of most previous observations. While entropy plateaus and large entropy excesses may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. Our results suggest that current feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required for long-lived cool cores.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids), although this result is likely affected by some coma contamination. 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time. Additional photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric monitoring of 3I/ATLAS by ground- and space-based telescopes, and possibly spacecraft based at Mars, are highly encouraged for characterizing 3I/ATLAS's rotational light curve, activity evolution, nongravitational acceleration, and compositional indicators of formation conditions.</description>
