      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors in the complete graph $K_n$, is a central object in combinatorial optimization, with applications ranging from max-cut problems to correlation analysis. Building on a probabilistic interpretation via agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables, we derive an explicit closed-form formula for enumerating the vertices of the related polytope $1$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$. Our approach is based on a natural binary encoding of cut vectors and introduces the alternating cycle function, a map that generates integer sequences with palindromic and recursive structure. This encoding directly captures the vertex structure and reveals that the scaled encoded vertices, perhaps unexpectedly, exhibit an almost-linear behaviour. This work provides the first explicit vertex enumeration formula for this classical polytope family.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Matroid Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of constructing fault-tolerant bases in matroids. Given a matroid M and a redundancy parameter k, a k-fault-tolerant basis is a minimum-size set of elements such that, even after the removal of any k elements, the remaining subset still spans the entire ground set. Since matroids generalize linear independence across structures such as vector spaces, graphs, and set systems, this problem unifies and extends several fault-tolerant concepts appearing in prior research.
  Our main contribution is a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the k-fault-tolerant basis problem, parameterized by both k and the rank r of the matroid. This two-variable parameterization by k + r is shown to be tight in the following sense. On the one hand, the problem is already NP-hard for k=1. On the other hand, it is Para-NP-hard for r \geq 3 and polynomial-time solvable for r \leq 2.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Topic Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution. In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset composition than existing topic modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of Arnoux-Rauzy words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite word generated by a substitution is rigid if all the substitutions which fix this word are powers of a same substitution. Sturmian words as well as characteristic Arnoux-Rauzy words are known to be rigid. In the present paper, we prove that all Arnoux-Rauzy words are rigid. The proof relies on two main ingredients: firstly, the fact that the primitive substitutions that fix an Arnoux-Rauzy word share a common power, and secondly, the notion of normal form of an episturmian substitution (i.e., a substitution that fixes an Arnoux-Rauzy word). The main difficulty is then of a combinatorial nature and relies on the normalization process when taking powers of episturmian substitutions: the normal form of a square is not necessarily equal to the square of the normal forms.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Non-Linear Cellular Automata: Permutivity, Surjectivity and Reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the algebraic conditions under which a cellular automaton with a non-linear local rule exhibits surjectivity and reversibility. We also analyze the role of permutivity as a key factor influencing these properties and provide conditions that determine whether a non-linear CA is (bi)permutive. Through theoretical results and illustrative examples, we characterize the relationships between these fundamental properties, offering new insights into the dynamical behavior of non-linear CA.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Constrained Scheduling with Tree-Like Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates concurrency-constrained scheduling problems, where the objective is to construct a schedule for a set of jobs subject to concurrency restrictions. Formally, we are given a conflict graph $G$ defined over a set of $n$ jobs, where an edge between two jobs in $G$ indicates that these jobs cannot be executed concurrently. Each job may have distinct attributes, such as processing time, due date, weight, and release time. The goal is to determine a schedule that optimizes a specified scheduling criterion while adhering to all concurrency constraints. This framework offers a versatile model for analyzing resource allocation problems where processes compete for shared resources, such as access to shared memory. From a theoretical perspective, it encompasses several classical graph coloring problems, including Chromatic Number, Sum Coloring, and Interval Chromatic Number.
  Given that even the simplest concurrency-constrained scheduling problems are NP-hard for general conflict graphs, this study focuses on conflict graphs with bounded treewidth. Our results establish a dichotomy: Some problems in this setting can be solved in FPT time, while others are shown to be XALP-complete for treewidth as parameter. Along the way, we generalize several previously known results on coloring problems for bounded treewidth graphs. Several of the FPT algorithms are based on the insight that completion times are bounded by the Grundy number of the conflict graph - the fact that this number is bounded by the product of treewidth and the logarithm of the number of vertices then leads to the FPT time bound.</description>

      <title>Multispreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive one-weight codes over a finite field of non-prime order are equivalent to special subspace coverings of the points of a projective space, which we call multispreads. The current paper is devoted to the characterization of the parameters of multispreads, which is equivalent to the characterization of the parameters of additive one-weight codes and, via duality, of additive completely regular codes of covering radius 1 (intriguing sets). We characterize these parameters for the case of the prime-square order of the field and make a partial characterization for the prime-cube case and the case of the fourth degree of a prime, including a complete characterization for orders 8, 27, and 16.
  Keywords: spreads, multispreads, additive codes, one-weight codes, completely regular codes, intriguing sets</description>

      <title>Reductions in local certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where a prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small piece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then decide whether the property $\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their certificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property $\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the optimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\mathcal{P}$, which can be viewed a measure of the local complexity of $\mathcal{P}$.
  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the certificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have been a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for general graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the certificates are usually very problem-dependent.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local certification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates for a property $\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property $\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain polynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian connectivity of some base-cobase graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been wide interest in understanding which properties of base graphs of matroids extend to base-cobase graphs of matroids. A significant result of Naddef and Pulleyblank (1984) shows that the $1$-skeleton of any $(0,1)$-polytope is either a hypercube, or Hamiltonian-connected, i.e. there is a Hamiltonian path connecting any two vertices. In particular, this is true for base graphs of matroids. A natural question raised by Farber, Richter, and Shank (1985) is whether this extends to base-cobase graphs.
  First, we use the polytopal approach to show Hamiltonian connectivity of base-cobase graphs of series-parallel extensions of lattice path matroids. On the other hand, we show that this method extends to only very special classes related to identically self-dual matroids. Second, we show that base-cobase graphs of wheels and whirls are Hamiltonian connected. Last, we show that the regular matroid $R_{10}$ yields a negative answer to the question of Farber, Richter, and Shank.</description>
