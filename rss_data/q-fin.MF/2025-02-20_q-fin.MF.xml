      <title>Dual Formulation of the Optimal Consumption problem with Multiplicative Habit Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a dual formulation of the optimal consumption problem with internal multiplicative habit formation. In this problem, the agent derives utility from the ratio of consumption to the internal habit component. Due to this multiplicative specification of the habit model, the optimal consumption problem is not strictly concave and incorporates irremovable path-dependency. As a consequence, standard Lagrangian techniques fail to supply a candidate for the corresponding dual formulation. Using Fenchel's Duality Theorem, we manage to identify a candidate formulation and prove that it satisfies strong duality. On the basis of this strong duality result, we are able to derive duality relations that stipulate how the optimal primal controls depend on the optimal dual controls and vice versa. {Moreover, using the dual formulation, we develop an analytical evaluation mechanism to bound the accuracy of approximations to the optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Annuity: A Quest for the Holy Grail of Lifetime Financial Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for decentralized annuities, aiming to address the limitations of traditional pension systems such as defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) plans, while providing lifetime financial support. It sheds light on often ignored pitfalls within current retirement schemes and introduces individual rationality properties. The research delves into various fairness concepts that underpin existing plans, emphasizing that decentralized annuities, while meeting similar fairness criteria, offer enhanced flexibility for individual rationality and improved social welfare for all participants. Using theoretical models and examples, we demonstrate the potential of decentralized annuities to outperform self-managed plans (DC) and to produce effects comparable to defined benefit (DB) plans, particularly within larger participant pools. The paper concludes by exploring the managerial implications of decentralized annuities and laying the groundwork for the further advancement of equitable and sustainable decentralized annuity systems.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose naturally into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage-free catastrophe reinsurance valuation for compound dynamic contagion claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider catastrophe stop-loss reinsurance valuation for a reinsurance company with dynamic contagion claims. To deal with conventional and emerging catastrophic events, we propose the use of a compound dynamic contagion process for the catastrophic component of the liability. Under the premise that there is an absence of arbitrage opportunity in the market, we obtain arbitrage-free premiums for these contacts. To this end, the Esscher transform is adopted to specify an equivalent martingale probability measure. We show that reinsurers have various ways of levying the security loading on the net premiums to quantify the catastrophic liability in light of the growing challenges posed by emerging risks arising from climate change, cyberattacks, and pandemics. We numerically compare arbitrage-free catastrophe stop-loss reinsurance premiums via the Monte Carlo simulation method. Sensitivity analyzes are performed by changing the Esscher parameters and the retention level.</description>

      <title>On the implied volatility of European and Asian call options under the stochastic volatility Bachelier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the short-time behavior of the at-the-money implied volatility for European and arithmetic Asian call options with fixed strike price. The asset price is assumed to follow the Bachelier model with a general stochastic volatility process. Using techniques of the Malliavin calculus such as the anticipating Ito's formula we first compute the level of the implied volatility when the maturity converges to zero. Then, we find a short maturity asymptotic formula for the skew of the implied volatility that depends on the roughness of the volatility model. We apply our general results to the SABR and fractional Bergomi models, and provide some numerical simulations that confirm the accurateness of the asymptotic formula for the skew.</description>

      <title>When defaults cannot be hedged: an actuarial approach to xVA calculations via local risk-minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the pricing and hedging of counterparty credit risk and funding when there is no possibility to hedge the jump to default of either the bank or the counterparty. This represents the situation which is most often encountered in practice, due to the absence of quoted corporate bonds or CDS contracts written on the counterparty and the difficulty for the bank to buy/sell protection on her own default. We apply local risk-minimization to find the optimal strategy and compute it via a BSDE.</description>
