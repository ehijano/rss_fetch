      <title>Revolutionizing Wireless Networks with Self-Supervised Learning: A Pathway to Intelligent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of mobile devices and data, next-generation wireless communication systems face stringent requirements for ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, and massive connectivity. Traditional AI-driven wireless network designs, while promising, often suffer from limitations such as dependency on labeled data and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we present an integration of self-supervised learning (SSL) into wireless networks. SSL leverages large volumes of unlabeled data to train models, enhancing scalability, adaptability, and generalization. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of SSL, categorizing its application scenarios in wireless network optimization and presenting a case study on its impact on semantic communication. Our findings highlight the potentials of SSL to significantly improve wireless network performance without extensive labeled data, paving the way for more intelligent and efficient communication systems.</description>

      <title>SpikePipe: Accelerated Training of Spiking Neural Networks via Inter-Layer Pipelining and Multiprocessor Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained popularity due to their high energy efficiency. Prior works have proposed various methods for training SNNs, including backpropagation-based methods. Training SNNs is computationally expensive compared to their conventional counterparts and would benefit from multiprocessor hardware acceleration. This is the first paper to propose inter-layer pipelining to accelerate training in SNNs using systolic array-based processors and multiprocessor scheduling. The impact of training using delayed gradients is observed using three networks training on different datasets, showing no degradation for small networks and &lt; 10% degradation for large networks. The mapping of various training tasks of the SNN onto systolic arrays is formulated, and the proposed scheduling method is evaluated on the three networks. The results are compared against standard pipelining algorithms. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average speedup of 1.6X compared to standard pipelining algorithms, with an upwards of 2X improvement in some cases. The incurred communication overhead due to the proposed method is less than 0.5% of the total required communication of training.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced NOMA Short-Packet Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates a short-packet downlink transmission system using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhanced via movable antenna (MA). We focuses on maximizing the effective throughput for a core user while ensuring reliable communication for an edge user by optimizing the MAs' coordinates and the power and rate allocations from the access point (AP). The optimization challenge is approached by decomposing it into two subproblems, utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) to handle the highly non-concave nature of channel gains. Numerical results confirm that the proposed solution offers substantial improvements in effective throughput compared to NOMA short-packet communication with fixed position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>ACCO: Automated Causal CNN Scheduling Optimizer for Real-Time Edge Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (ST-CNN) allow extending CNN capabilities from image processing to consecutive temporal-pattern recognition. Generally, state-of-the-art (SotA) ST-CNNs inflate the feature maps and weights from well-known CNN backbones to represent the additional time dimension. However, edge computing applications would suffer tremendously from such large computation or memory overhead. Fortunately, the overlapping nature of ST-CNN enables various optimizations, such as the dilated causal convolution structure and Depth-First (DF) layer fusion to reuse the computation between time steps and CNN sliding windows, respectively. Yet, no hardware-aware approach has been proposed that jointly explores the optimal strategy from a scheduling as well as a hardware point of view. To this end, we present ACCO, an automated optimizer that explores efficient Causal CNN transformation and DF scheduling for ST-CNNs on edge hardware accelerators. By cost-modeling the computation and data movement on the accelerator architecture, ACCO automatically selects the best scheduling strategy for the given hardware-algorithm target. Compared to the fixed dilated causal structure, ST-CNNs with ACCO reach an ~8.4x better Energy-Delay-Product. Meanwhile, ACCO improves ~20% in layer-fusion optimals compared to the SotA DF exploration toolchain. When jointly optimizing ST-CNN on the temporal and spatial dimension, ACCO's scheduling outcomes are on average 19x faster and 37x more energy-efficient than spatial DF schemes.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Array Empowered ISAC Systems for Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a movable-antenna (MA) array empowered integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) over low-altitude platform (LAP) system to support low-altitude economy (LAE) applications. In the considered system, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched to hover in the air, working as the UAV-enabled LAP (ULAP) to provide information transmission and sensing simultaneously for LAE applications. To improve the throughput capacity, we formulate a data rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit information and sensing beamforming and the antenna positions of the MA array. Since the data rate maximization problem is non-convex with highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient alternation optimization based algorithm, which iteratively optimizes parts of the variables while fixing others. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed MA array-based scheme in terms of the achievable data rate and beamforming gain compared with two benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Agent DRL for Radio Resource Management in Industrial 6G in-X subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 6G in-X subnetworks have been proposed as low-power short-range radio cells to support localized extreme wireless connectivity inside entities such as industrial robots, vehicles, and the human body. Deployment of in-X subnetworks within these entities may result in rapid changes in interference levels and thus, varying link quality. This paper investigates distributed dynamic channel allocation to mitigate inter-subnetwork interference in dense in-factory deployments of 6G in-X subnetworks. This paper introduces two new techniques, Federated Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (F-MADDQN) and Federated Multi-Agent Deep Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MADPPO), for channel allocation in 6G in-X subnetworks. These techniques are based on a client-to-server horizontal federated reinforcement learning framework. The methods require sharing only local model weights with a centralized gNB for federated aggregation thereby preserving local data privacy and security. Simulations were conducted using a practical indoor factory environment proposed by 5G-ACIA and 3GPP models for in-factory environments. The results showed that the proposed methods achieved slightly better performance than baseline schemes with significantly reduced signaling overhead compared to the baseline solutions. The schemes also showed better robustness and generalization ability to changes in deployment densities and propagation parameters.</description>

      <title>DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional discriminative communication paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Dynamic Rich Scattering Environments: BiLSTM-Based Optimization for Accurate User Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless environments offers channel programmability and dynamic control over propagation channels, which is expected to play a crucial role in sixth generation (6G) networks. The majority of RIS-related research has focused on simpler, quasi-free-space conditions, where wireless channels are typically modeled analytically. However, many practical localization scenarios unfold in environments characterized by rich scattering that also change over time. These dynamic and complex conditions pose significant challenges in determining the optimal RIS configuration to maximize localization accuracy. In this paper, we present our approach to overcoming this challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages a bidirectional long-short term memory (biLSTM) network, trained with a simulator that accurately reflects wave physics, to capture the relationship between wireless channels and the RIS configuration under dynamic, rich-scattering conditions. We use this approach to optimize RIS configurations for enhanced user equipment (UE) localization, measured by mean squared error (MSE). Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach adapts RIS configurations to significantly improve localization accuracy in such dynamically changing rich scattering environments.</description>

Abstract: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given its high risk and often asymptomatic nature, real-time continuous monitoring is essential. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) are well-known for their energy efficiency, making them ideal for wearable devices and energy-constrained edge computing platforms. However, current energy measurement of SNN implementations for detecting heart diseases typically rely on empirical values, often overlooking hardware overhead. Additionally, the integer and fire activations in SNNs require multiple memory accesses and repeated computations, which can further compromise energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose sparrowSNN, a redesign of the standard SNN workflow from a hardware perspective, and present a dedicated ASIC design for SNNs, optimized for ultra-low power wearable devices used in heartbeat classification. Using the MIT-BIH dataset, our SNN achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.29% for SNNs, with energy consumption of 31.39nJ per inference and power usage of 6.1uW, making sparrowSNN the highest accuracy with the lowest energy use among comparable systems. We also compare the energy-to-accuracy trade-offs between SNNs and quantized ANNs, offering recommendations on insights on how best to use SNNs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Neural Decoding Backbones towards Enhanced On-edge iBCI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCIs) typically depend on neural decoding processes conducted on workstations within laboratory settings, which prevents their everyday usage. Implementing these decoding processes on edge devices, such as the wearables, introduces considerable challenges related to computational demands, processing speed, and maintaining accuracy. This study seeks to identify an optimal neural decoding backbone that boasts robust performance and swift inference capabilities suitable for edge deployment. We executed a series of neural decoding experiments involving nonhuman primates engaged in random reaching tasks, evaluating four prospective models, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Transformer, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), and Selective State Space model (Mamba), across several metrics: single-session decoding, multi-session decoding, new session fine-tuning, inference speed, calibration speed, and scalability. The findings indicate that although the GRU model delivers sufficient accuracy, the RWKV and Mamba models are preferable due to their superior inference and calibration speeds. Additionally, RWKV and Mamba comply with the scaling law, demonstrating improved performance with larger data sets and increased model sizes, whereas GRU shows less pronounced scalability, and the Transformer model requires computational resources that scale prohibitively. This paper presents a thorough comparative analysis of the four models in various scenarios. The results are pivotal in pinpointing an optimal backbone that can handle increasing data volumes and is viable for edge implementation. This analysis provides essential insights for ongoing research and practical applications in the field.</description>

      <title>FlexLoc: Conditional Neural Networks for Zero-Shot Sensor Perspective Invariance in Object Localization with Distributed Multimodal Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization is a critical technology for various applications ranging from navigation and surveillance to assisted living. Localization systems typically fuse information from sensors viewing the scene from different perspectives to estimate the target location while also employing multiple modalities for enhanced robustness and accuracy. Recently, such systems have employed end-to-end deep neural models trained on large datasets due to their superior performance and ability to handle data from diverse sensor modalities. However, such neural models are often trained on data collected from a particular set of sensor poses (i.e., locations and orientations). During real-world deployments, slight deviations from these sensor poses can result in extreme inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we introduce FlexLoc, which employs conditional neural networks to inject node perspective information to adapt the localization pipeline. Specifically, a small subset of model weights are derived from node poses at run time, enabling accurate generalization to unseen perspectives with minimal additional overhead. Our evaluations on a multimodal, multiview indoor tracking dataset showcase that FlexLoc improves the localization accuracy by almost 50% in the zero-shot case (no calibration data available) compared to the baselines. The source code of FlexLoc is available at https://github.com/nesl/FlexLoc.</description>

      <title>Aerial Relay to Achieve Covertness and Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a delay-tolerant unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relayed covert and secure communication framework is investigated. In this framework, a legitimate UAV serves as an aerial relay to realize communication when the direct link between the terrestrial transmitter and receiver is blocked and also acts as a friendly jammer to suppress the malicious nodes presented on the ground. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of malicious nodes' positions, a robust fractional programming optimization problem is built to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit power of the transmitter, and the time-switching factor. For the extremely complicated covert constraint, Pinsker's inequality, Jensen's inequality, and the bisection search method are employed to construct a tractable shrunken one. After this, an alternate optimization-based algorithm is proposed to solve the fractional programming optimization problem. To achieve low complexity, we design the primal-dual search-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation-based algorithm, respectively, for each sub-problem. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Smart Wireless Environment Enhanced Telecommunications: A Network Stabilisation Paradigm for Mobile Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the uncontrolled and complex real-life radio propagation environments, Claude Shannon's information theory of communications describes fundamental limits to state-of-the-art 5G radio access network (RAN) capacity, with respect to fixed radio resource usage. Fortunately, recent research has found that a holographic metasurface-based new physical layer architecture may hold the key to overcome these fundamental limits of current mobile networks under a new paradigm, smart wireless environment (SWE), where the long-standing challenge of mobile communications, fading channel hostility, may be solved, leading to a step-change boost in network performance and user experience. Despite recent research activities in SWE, the best way to implement it as a network operator remains an open challenge. In this industrial review, we adopt a novel yet realistic mobile channel stabilisation perspective for network operators to understand this paradigm shift. More specifically, we provide a technical analysis of the synergy between key next-gen mobile network enablers, e.g., holographic metasurface, wireless sensing, and machine intelligence, as well as of how this synergy leads to a robust future RAN architecture. Against the as yet unclear theoretical boundaries and low technology readiness level (TRL) of SWE enhanced telecommunications, we conclude by identifying critical challenges in future commercial deployments.</description>

      <title>Realizing RF Wavefront Copying with RIS for Future Extended Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lately a new approach to Extended Reality (XR), denoted as XR-RF, has been proposed which is realized by combining Radio Frequency (RF) Imaging and programmable wireless environments (PWEs). RF Imaging is a technique that aims to detect geometric and material features of an object through RF waves. On the other hand, the PWE focuses on the the conversion of the wireless RF propagation in a controllable, by software, entity through the utilization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), which can have a controllable interaction with impinging RF waves. In that sense, this dynamic synergy leverages the potential of RF Imaging to detect the structure of an object through RF wavefronts and the PWE's ability to selectively replicate those RF wavefronts from one spatial location to wherever an XR-RF mobile user is presently located. Then the captured wavefront, through appropriate hardware, is mapped to the visual representation of the object through machine learning models. As a key aspect of the XR-RF's system workflow is the wavefront copying mechanism, this work introduces a new PWE configuration algorithm for XR-RF. Moreover, it is shown that the waveform replication process inevitably yields imprecision in the replication process. After statistical analysis, based on simulation results, it is shown that this imprecision can be effectively modeled by the gamma distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup of the Dispersion and Codebook Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new formulations of max-sum and max-min dispersion problems that enable solutions via the Grover adaptive search (GAS) quantum algorithm, offering quadratic speedup. Dispersion problems are combinatorial optimization problems classified as NP-hard, which appear often in coding theory and wireless communications applications involving optimal codebook design. In turn, GAS is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm that can be used to implement full-fledged maximum-likelihood optimal solutions. In conventional naive formulations however, it is typical to rely on a binary vector spaces, resulting in search space sizes prohibitive even for GAS. To circumvent this challenge, we instead formulate the search of optimal dispersion problem over Dicke states, an equal superposition of binary vectors with equal Hamming weights, which significantly reduces the search space leading to a simplification of the quantum circuit via the elimination of penalty terms. Additionally, we propose a method to replace distance coefficients with their ranks, contributing to the reduction of the number of qubits. Our analysis demonstrates that as a result of the proposed techniques a reduction in query complexity compared to the conventional GAS using Hadamard transform is achieved, enhancing the feasibility of the quantum-based solution of the dispersion problem.</description>

      <title>Enhanced In-Flight Connectivity for Urban Air Mobility via LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is the envisioned future of inter-city aerial transportation. This paper presents a novel, in-flight connectivity link allocation method for UAM, which dynamically switches between terrestrial cellular and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks based on real-time conditions. Our approach prefers cellular networks for cost efficiency, switching to LEO satellites under poor cellular conditions to ensure continuous UAM connectivity. By integrating real-time metrics like signal strength, network congestion, and flight trajectory into the selection process, our algorithm effectively balances cost, minimum data rate requirements, and continuity of communication. Numerical results validate minimization of data-loss while ensuring an optimal selection from the set of available above-threshold data rates at every time sample. Furthermore, insights derived from our study emphasize the importance of hybrid connectivity solutions in ensuring seamless, uninterrupted communication for future urban aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Channel Prediction for RIS-assisted MIMO Systems With Channel Aging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance the performance of sixth-generation (6G) and beyond communication systems. The passive nature of RISs and their large number of reflecting elements pose challenges to the channel estimation process. The associated complexity further escalates when the channel coefficients are fast-varying as in scenarios with user mobility. In this paper, we propose an extended channel estimation framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) integrated with an autoregressive (AR) predictor. The implemented framework is designed for identifying the aging pattern and predicting enhanced estimates of the wireless channels in correlated fast-fading environments. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CNN-AR approach is robust to channel aging, exhibiting a high-precision estimation accuracy. The results also show that our approach can achieve high spectral efficiency and low pilot overhead compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Redefining Automotive Radar Imaging: A Domain-Informed 1D Deep Learning Approach for High-Resolution and Efficient Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are indispensable for perception tasks of autonomous vehicles, thanks to their resilience in challenging weather conditions. Yet, their deployment is often limited by insufficient spatial resolution for precise semantic scene interpretation. Classical super-resolution techniques adapted from optical imaging inadequately address the distinct characteristics of radar signal data. In response, our study redefines radar imaging super-resolution as a one-dimensional (1D) signal super-resolution spectra estimation problem by harnessing the radar signal processing domain knowledge, introducing innovative data normalization and a domain-informed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-guided loss function. Our tailored deep learning network for automotive radar imaging exhibits remarkable scalability, parameter efficiency and fast inference speed, alongside enhanced performance in terms of radar imaging quality and resolution. Extensive testing confirms that our SR-SPECNet sets a new benchmark in producing high-resolution radar range-azimuth images, outperforming existing methods across varied antenna configurations and dataset sizes. Source code and new radar dataset will be made publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robust IRS-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Optimization in IRS-Assisted Communication Systems With Imperfect CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communication system with single-antenna transmitter and receiver, under imperfect channel state information (CSI). More specifically, we deal with the robust selection of binary (on/off) states of the IRS elements in order to maximize the worst-case energy efficiency (EE), given a bounded CSI uncertainty, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, we consider not only continuous but also discrete IRS phase shifts. First, we derive closed-form expressions of the worst-case SNRs, and then formulate the robust (discrete) optimization problems for each case. In the case of continuous phase shifts, we design a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to achieve the global maximum with polynomial complexity $O(L\,{\log L})$, where $L$ is the number of IRS elements. In the case of discrete phase shifts, we develop a convex-relaxation-based method (CRBM) to obtain a feasible (sub-optimal) solution in polynomial time $O(L^{3.5})$, with a posteriori performance guarantee. Furthermore, numerical simulations provide useful insights and confirm the theoretical results. In particular, the proposed algorithms are several orders of magnitude faster than the exhaustive search when $L$ is large, thus being highly scalable and suitable for practical applications. Moreover, both algorithms outperform a baseline scheme, namely, the activation of all IRS elements.</description>

      <title>DISCO Might Not Be Funky: Random Intelligent Reflective Surface Configurations That Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) significantly improve system performance, but also pose a significant risk for physical layer security (PLS). Unlike the extensive research on legitimate IRS-enhanced communications, in this article we present an adversarial IRS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ). We describe typical application scenarios for Disco IRS (DIRS)-based FPJ, where an illegitimate IRS with random, time-varying reflection properties acts like a "disco ball" to randomly change the propagation environment. We introduce the principles of DIRS-based FPJ and overview existing investigations of the technology, including a design example employing one-bit phase shifters. The DIRS-based FPJ can be implemented without either jamming power or channel state information (CSI) for the legitimate users (LUs). It does not suffer from the energy constraints of traditional active jammers, nor does it require any knowledge of the LU channels. In addition to the proposed jamming attack, we also propose an anti-jamming strategy that requires only statistical rather than instantaneous CSI. Furthermore, we present a data frame structure that enables the legitimate access point (AP) to estimate the DIRS-jammed channels' statistical characteristics in the presence of the DIRS jamming. Typical cases are discussed to show the impact of the DIRS-based FPJ and the feasibility of the anti-jamming precoder (AJP). Moreover, we outline future research directions and challenges for the DIRS-based FPJ and its anti-jamming precoding to stimulate this line of research and pave the way for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of an IRS on the Out-of-Band Performance in Sub-6 GHz &amp; mmWave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) were introduced to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems. However, from a service provider's viewpoint, a concern with the use of an IRS is its effect on out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if two operators, say X and Y, provide services in a given geographical area using non-overlapping frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of its users (UEs), does it degrade the performance of UEs served by operator Y? We answer this by analyzing the average and instantaneous performances of the OOB operator considering both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Specifically, we derive the ergodic sum SE achieved by the operators under round-robin scheduling. We also derive the outage probability and analyze the change in the SNR caused by the IRS at an OOB UE using stochastic dominance theory. Surprisingly, even though the IRS is randomly configured from operator Y's point of view, the OOB operator still benefits from the presence of the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for free in both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. This is because the IRS introduces additional paths between the transmitter and receiver, increasing the overall signal power arriving at the UE and providing diversity benefits. Finally, we show that the use of opportunistic scheduling schemes can further enhance the benefit of the uncontrolled IRS at OOB UEs. We numerically illustrate our findings and conclude that an IRS is always beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS is deployed &amp; controlled by only one operator.</description>

      <title>AFDM-SCMA: A Promising Waveform for Massive Connectivity over High Mobility Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)-empowered sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system, referred to as AFDM-SCMA, for supporting massive connectivity in high-mobility environments. First, by placing the sparse codewords on the AFDM chirp subcarriers, the input-output (I/O) relation of AFDM-SCMA systems is presented. Next, we delve into the generalized receiver design, chirp rate selection, and error rate performance of the proposed AFDM-SCMA. The proposed AFDM-SCMA is shown to provide a general framework and subsume the existing OFDM-SCMA as a special case. Third, for efficient transceiver design, we further propose a class of sparse codebooks for simplifying the I/O relation, referred to as I/O relation-inspired codebook design in this paper. Building upon these codebooks, we propose a novel iterative detection and decoding scheme with linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator for both downlink and uplink channels based on orthogonal approximate message passing principles. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AFDM-SCMA systems over OFDM-SCMA systems in terms of the error rate performance. We show that the proposed receiver can significantly enhance the error rate performance while reducing the detection complexity.</description>

      <title>Room Transfer Function Reconstruction Using Complex-valued Neural Networks and Irregularly Distributed Microphones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the room transfer functions needed to calculate the complex sound field in a room has several important real-world applications. However, an unpractical number of microphones is often required. Recently, in addition to classical signal processing methods, deep learning techniques have been applied to reconstruct the room transfer function starting from a very limited set of measurements at scattered points in the room. In this paper, we employ complex-valued neural networks to estimate room transfer functions in the frequency range of the first room resonances, using a few irregularly distributed microphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that complex-valued neural networks are used to estimate room transfer functions. To analyze the benefits of applying complex-valued optimization to the considered task, we compare the proposed technique with a state-of-the-art kernel-based signal processing approach for sound field reconstruction, showing that the proposed technique exhibits relevant advantages in terms of phase accuracy and overall quality of the reconstructed sound field. For informative purposes, we also compare the model with a similarly-structured data-driven approach that, however, applies a real-valued neural network to reconstruct only the magnitude of the sound field.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks intending to effectively balance sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose a cooperative networked ISAC scheme to enhance both S&amp;C services. Then, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network. Remarkably, the derived expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization accuracy unveils a significant finding: Deploying $N$ ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the $\ln^2N$ scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the time-sharing scheme, the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme can effectively improve the average data rate and reduce the CRLB.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis, Scaling Laws and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks are investigated with the objective of effectively balancing the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose an innovative networked ISAC scheme, where multiple transceivers are employed for collaboratively enhancing the S&amp;C services. Then, the potent tool of stochastic geometry is exploited for characterizing the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate the key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize salient network-level parameters. Remarkably, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression of the localization accuracy derived unveils a significant finding: Deploying N ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the ln^2N scaling law. Crucially, this scaling law is less pronounced in comparison to the performance enhancement of N^2 achieved when the transceivers are equidistant from the target, which is primarily due to the substantial path loss from the distant base stations (BSs) and leads to reduced contributions to sensing performance gain. Moreover, we derive a tight expression of the communication rate, and present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the optimal cooperative cluster size. Based on our expression derived for the S&amp;C performance, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the network performance in terms of two joint S&amp;C metrics. To this end, we jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes and the transmit power to strike a flexible tradeoff between the S&amp;C performance.</description>

Abstract: 6DMA (six-dimensional movable antenna) is a new and revolutionizing technology that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variation at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces (arrays). In this article, we provide an overview of 6DMA for unveiling its great potential in wireless networks, including its motivation and competitive advantages over existing technologies, system/channel modeling, and practical implementation. In particular, we present a variety of 6DMA-enabled performance enhancement in terms of array gain, spatial multiplexing, interference suppression, and geometric gain. Furthermore, we illustrate the main applications of 6DMA in wireless communication and sensing, and elaborate their design challenges as well as promising solutions. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the significant capacity improvement of 6DMA-aided communication in wireless network.</description>
