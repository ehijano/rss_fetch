      <title>Influence of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on the Formation of Biosilica Patterns in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of regularly structured silica valves in diatoms is a captivating process in biomineralization. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins, have been found to be essential in this process. The molecular structure of synthesized polyamines greatly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings indicate that silica precipitation occurs at specific concentrations of phosphate ions, with higher concentrations resulting in larger aggregates of organic molecules that serve as templates for silica formation.
  Our study focuses on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by the phase separation of species-specific organic molecules, with the evolving organic structures acting as templates for silica deposition. We specifically investigate the role of phosphate ions in the self-assembly of long-chain polyamines and analyze how their reaction with organic molecules impacts the morphology of the organic template. By varying the model parameters, including degree of dissociation and initial concentrations of reacting components, we show that the resulting geometric features of the patterns are highly dependent on these factors.
  Furthermore, we explore the scenario where an initial array of organic droplets serves as a static template for silica deposition, considering the effects of "prepatterning" by the silica costae in the base layer. We obtain numerical solutions that generate a diverse range of two-dimensional patterns closely resembling the valve structures observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Identifying bimodality in data using a proximity-based null model with an application to classifying cell cycle phases using oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting communities in large complex networks has found a wide range of applications in physical, biological, and social sciences by identifying mesoscopic groups based on the links between individual units. Moreover, community detection approaches have been generalized to various data analysis tasks by constructing networks whose links depend on individual units' measurements. However, identifying well-separated subpopulations in data sets, e.g., multimodality, still presents challenges as both community detection with existing null models and other partition methods either fail to give partitions that correspond to dips in the data or give partitions that do not correspond to dips in the data. Here we introduce a new spatially informed null model for this task that takes into account spatial structure but does not explicitly depend on distances between measurements. We find that community detection using this null model successfully identifies subpopulations in multimodal data and accurately does not for unimodal data. This new method represents a complement to statistical methods, as we treat data directly using a network science approach. We apply this new null model to first distinguish interphase and mitotic cell cycle phases and then S and G2 cell cycle phases in a group of Dictyostelium discoideum cells using measurements of oxidative stress, which have been shown to correlate strongly with cell-cycle behaviors.</description>

      <title>Generation of kink-antikink pairs through the excitation of an oscillon in the $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the oscillon decay in a model with a single scalar field and two asymmetric fundamental states. Specifically, we verify how the evolution of an initially excited oscillon leads to the formation of antikink-kink pairs in the presence of a centered long-lived pulse. In such a context, the magnitude of the original perturbation stands for the most important factor influencing the process. For intermediary values of this magnitude, we find a transitory behavior which suggests that the energy exchange between translational and vibrational modes begins to play an important role in the overall evolution. As the magnitude increases, the centered pulse intermediates an interaction between the inner structures which compose the pairs whose behavior mimics that of a standard antikink-kink collision and therefore reinforces the role played by the energy transfer mechanism. We depict the resulting resonant structure and note that it mimics that of an usual kink-antikink scattering. We also reproduce some of our results now via an initial lumplike perturbation proposed as a kink-antikink pair. For different values of width, {\it{an almost pure}} antikink-kink pair escapes to the infinity after multiple bounces.</description>
