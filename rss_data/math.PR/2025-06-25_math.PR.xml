      <title>Sprinkled Decoupling for Hammersley's Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove a sprinkled decoupling inequality for the stationary Hammersley's interacting particle process. Inspired by the work of Baldasso and Texeira (2018), and Hil\'ario, Kious and Texeira (2020), we apply this inequality to study two distinct problems on the top of this particle process. First, we analyze a detection problem, demonstrating that a fugitive can evade particles, provided that their jump range is sufficiently large. Second, we show that a random walk in a dynamic random environment exhibits ballistic behavior with respect to the characteristic speed of the particle system, under a weak assumption on the probability of being away of this critical speed.</description>

      <title>Variational formula for the logarithmic potential of free additive convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general variational formula for the logarithmic potential of the free additive convolution of two compactly supported probability measure on $\R$. The formula is given in terms of the $R$-transform of the first measure, and the logarithmic potential of second measure. The result applies in particular to the additive convolution with the semicircle or Marchenko-Pastur laws, for which the formula simplifies. The logarithmic potential of additive convolutions appears for instance in estimates of the determinant of sums of independent random matrices.</description>

      <title>The longest increasing subsequence of Brownian separable permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a scaling limit result for the length $\operatorname{LIS}(\sigma_n)$ of the longest increasing subsequence of a permutation $\sigma_n$ of size $n$ sampled from the Brownian separable permuton $\boldsymbol{\mu}_p$ of parameter $p\in(0,1)$, which is the universal limit of pattern-avoiding permutations. Specifically, we prove that \[\frac{\operatorname{LIS}(\sigma_n)}{n^\alpha}\;\underset{n\to\infty}{\overset{\mathrm{a.s.}}{\longrightarrow}}\; X,\] where $\alpha=\alpha(p)$ is the unique solution in the interval $(1/2,1)$ to the equation \[\frac{1}{4^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}\sqrt{\pi}}\,\frac{\Gamma\big(\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{2\alpha}\big)}{\Gamma\big(1-\tfrac{1}{2\alpha}\big)}=\frac{p}{p-1},\] and $X=X(p)$ is a non-deterministic and a.s. positive and finite random variable, which is a measurable function of the Brownian separable permuton. Notably, the exponent $\alpha(p)$ is an increasing continuous function of $p$ with $\alpha(0^+)=1/2$, $\alpha(1^-)=1$ and $\alpha(1/2)\approx0.815226$, which corresponds to the permuton limit of uniform separable permutations. We prove analogous results for the size of the largest clique of a graph sampled from the Brownian cographon of parameter $p\in(0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Geometry and Information Dynamics on Hyperspherical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical geometry of random chords on n-dimensional spheres by deriving explicit analytical expressions for the chord length distribution and its associated structural properties. A critical threshold emerges at dimension 19, marking the transition from curvature-dominated variability to high-dimensional concentration, where interpoint distances become nearly deterministic and probabilistic diversity collapses into geometric uniformity. We further derive a closed-form expression for the Fisher information, showing that it is inversely proportional to the square of the radius and varies non-monotonically with dimension. Notably, it attains a minimum at dimension 7, coinciding with the dimension at which the volume of the unit sphere is maximized. This reflects a unique regime of maximal spatial diffuseness and minimal inferential sensitivity, arising from the interplay between weakening curvature and still-latent concentration. The alignment between volumetric and statistical extrema reveals a deeper duality between geometry and information. We also analyze the characteristic function, which exhibits a dichotomy: in even dimensions, it takes rational-exponential form, while in odd dimensions it involves Bessel and Struve functions. This distinction reflects differences in harmonic structure and boundary regularity across dimensions. Together, these findings show how curvature and dimension jointly regulate statistical efficiency on hyperspherical domains, with implications for geometric inference and high-dimensional learning.</description>

      <title>Fully lifted \emph{blirp} interpolation -- a large deviation view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [104] introduced a powerful \emph{fully lifted} (fl) statistical interpolating mechanism. It established a nested connection between blirps (bilinearly indexed random processes) and their decoupled (linearly indexed) comparative counterparts. We here revisit the comparison from [104] and introduce its a \emph{large deviation} upgrade. The new machinery allows to substantially widen the [104]'s range of applicability. In addition to \emph{typical}, studying analytically much harder \emph{atypical} random structures features is now possible as well. To give a bit of a practical flavor, we show how the obtained results connect to the so-called \emph{local entropies} (LE) and their predicated role in understanding solutions clustering and associated \emph{computational gaps} in hard random optimization problems. As was the case in [104], even though the technical considerations often appear as fairly involved, the final interpolating forms admit elegant expressions thereby providing a relatively easy to use tool readily available for further studies. Moreover, as the considered models encompass all well known random structures discussed in [104], the obtained results automatically apply to them as well.</description>

      <title>A large deviation view of \emph{stationarized} fully lifted blirp interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider \emph{bilinearly indexed random processes} (blirp) and study their interpolating comparative mechanisms. Generic introduction of the \emph{fully lifted} (fl) blirp interpolation in [105] was followed by a corresponding stationarization counterpart in [103]. A \emph{large deviation} upgrade of [105] introduced in companion paper [106] is complemented here with the corresponding one of [103]. Similarly to [106], the mechanism that we introduce extends the range of [103]'s applicability so that it encompasses random structures \emph{atypical} features. Among others these include the \emph{local entropies} (LE) which explain atypical solutions clusterings in hard random optimization problems believed to be directly responsible for the presumable existence of the so-called \emph{computational gaps}. Moreover (and similar to [105]), despite on occasion somewhat involved technical considerations, the final forms of the uncovered fundamental interpolating parameters relations are rather elegant and as such provide a valuable tool readily available for further use.</description>

      <title>Bismut Formula and Gradient Estimates for Dirichlet Semigroups with Application to Singular Killed DDSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By establishing a local version of Bismut formula for Dirichlet semigroups on a regular domain, gradient estimates are derived for killed SDEs with singular drifts. As an application, the total variation distance between two solutions of killed DDSDEs is bounded above by the truncated $1$-Wasserstein distance of initial distributions, in the regular and singular cases respectively.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of the value function in a stopper vs. singular-controller game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of zero-sum stochastic games between a stopper and a singular-controller, previously considered in [Bovo and De Angelis (2025)]. The underlying singularly-controlled dynamics takes values in $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. The problem is set on a finite time-horizon and is connected to a parabolic variational inequality of min-max type with spatial-derivative and obstacle constraints.
  We show that the value function of the problem is of class $C^1$ in the whole domain $[0,T)\times\mathcal{O}$ and that the second-order spatial derivative and the second-order mixed derivative are continuous everywhere except for a (potential) jump across a non-decreasing curve (the stopping boundary of the game). The latter discontinuity is a natural consequence of the partial differential equation associated to the problem. Beyond its intrinsic analytical value, such a regularity for the value function is a stepping stone for further exploring the structure and properties of the free-boundaries of the stochastic game, which in turn determine the optimal strategies of the players.</description>

      <title>From Minimax Optimal Importance Sampling to Uniformly Ergodic Importance-tempered MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make two closely related theoretical contributions to the use of importance sampling schemes. First, for independent sampling, we prove that the minimax optimal trial distribution coincides with the target if and only if the target distribution has no atom with probability greater than $1/2$, where "minimax" means that the worst-case asymptotic variance of the self-normalized importance sampling estimator is minimized. When a large atom exists, it should be downweighted by the trial distribution. A similar phenomenon holds for a continuous target distribution concentrated on a small set. Second, we argue that it is often advantageous to run the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a tempered stationary distribution, $\pi(x)^\beta$, and correct for the bias by importance weighting. The dynamics of this "importance-tempered" sampling scheme can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain. We prove that for one-dimensional targets with polynomial tails, $\pi(x) \propto (1 + |x|)^{-\gamma}$, this chain is uniformly ergodic if and only if $1/\gamma &lt; \beta &lt; (\gamma - 2)/\gamma$. These results suggest that for target distributions with light or polynomial tails of order $\gamma &gt; 3$, importance tempering can improve the precision of time-average estimators and essentially eliminate the need for burn-in.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>Bayesian community detection in assortative stochastic block model with unknown number of communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured data in the form of networks is increasingly common in a number of fields, including social sciences, biology, physics, computer science, and many others. A key task in network analysis is community detection, which typically consists of dividing the nodes into groups such that nodes within a group are strongly connected, while connections between groups are relatively scarcer. A generative model well-suited for the formation of such communities is the assortative stochastic block model, which prescribes a higher probability of a connection between nodes belonging to the same block rather than to different blocks. A recent line of work has utilized Bayesian nonparametric methods to recover communities in the SBM by placing a prior distribution on the number of blocks and estimating block assignments via collapsed Gibbs samplers. However, efficiently incorporating the assortativity constraint through the prior remains an open problem. In this work, we address this gap, aiming to study the effect of enforcing assortativity on Bayesian community detection and so identify under what scenario it pays its dividends in comparison with standard SBM. We illustrate our findings through an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>On the Age of Information in Single-Server Queues with Aged Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that quantifies the freshness of data in systems where timely updates are critical. Most state-of-the-art methods typically assume that packets enter the monitored system with zero age, neglecting situations, such as those prevalent in multi-hop networks or distributed sensing, where packets experience prior delays. In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero initial age. We derive an expression for the average AoI in this setting, showing that it equals the standard AoI plus a correction term involving the correlation between packet age and inter-departure times. When these variables are independent, the expression simplifies to an additive correction equal to the mean initial age. In cases where the dependency structure is unknown, we also establish lower and upper bounds for the correction term. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across various queueing scenarios, such as forwarding, tandem, and retrial queues. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of the derived bounds on a tandem composed of several queues, a model that has not yet been analytically solved from an age perspective.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal estimates for the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of deep random ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in [1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth. In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably, the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where $g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p + 1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.</description>

      <title>The high-dimensional asymptotics of first order methods with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of deterministic flows in ${\mathbb R}^{d\times k}$, parametrized by a random matrix ${\boldsymbol X}\in {\mathbb R}^{n\times d}$ with i.i.d. centered subgaussian entries. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of these flows over bounded time horizons, in the high-dimensional limit in which $n,d\to\infty$ with $k$ fixed and converging aspect ratios $n/d\to\delta$. The asymptotic characterization we prove is in terms of a system of a nonlinear stochastic process in $k$ dimensions, whose parameters are determined by a fixed point condition. This type of characterization is known in physics as dynamical mean field theory. Rigorous results of this type have been obtained in the past for a few spin glass models. Our proof is based on time discretization and a reduction to certain iterative schemes known as approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms, as opposed to earlier work that was based on large deviations theory and stochastic processes theory. The new approach provides a unified view of a general class of algorithms and implies that the high-dimensional behavior of the flow is universal with respect to the distribution of the entries of ${\boldsymbol X}$.
  As specific applications, we obtain high-dimensional characterizations of gradient flow in some classical models from statistics and machine learning, under a random design assumption.</description>

      <title>Real roots of random polynomials: asymptotics of the variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the precise leading asymptotics of the variance of the number of real roots for a large class of random polynomials, where the random coefficients have polynomial growth. Our results apply to many classical ensembles, including the Kac polynomials, hyperbolic polynomials, their derivatives, and any linear combinations of these polynomials. Prior to this paper, such asymptotics were established only for the Kac polynomials in the 1970s, with the seminal contribution of Maslova. The main ingredients of the proof are new asymptotic estimates for the two-point correlation function of the real roots, revealing geometric structures in the distribution of the real roots of these random polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain asymptotic normality for the real roots of these random polynomials, extending and strengthening a related result of O. Nguyen and V. Vu.</description>

      <title>Is 'being above the median' a noise sensitive property?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assign independent weights to the edges of the square lattice, from the uniform distribution on $\{a,b\}$ for some $0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;\infty$. The weighted graph induces a random metric on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Let $T_n$ denote the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(n,0)$ in this metric. The distribution of $T_n$ has a well-defined median. Itai Benjamini asked in 2011 if the sequence of Boolean functions encoding whether $T_n$ exceeds its median is noise sensitive? In this paper we present the first progress on Benjamini's problem. More precisely, we study the minimal weight along any path crossing an $n\times n$-square horizontally and whose vertical fluctuation is smaller than $n^{1/22}$, and show that for this observable, 'being above the median' is a noise sensitive property.</description>

      <title>A uniform particle approximation to the Navier-Stokes-alpha models in three dimensions with advection noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a system of interacting particles governed by a set of stochastic differential equations. Our main goal is to rigorously demonstrate that the empirical measure associated with the particle system converges uniformly, both in time and space, to the solution of the three dimensional Navier Stokes alpha model with advection noise. This convergence establishes a probabilistic framework for deriving macroscopic stochastic fluid equations from underlying microscopic dynamics. The analysis leverages semigroup techniques to address the nonlinear structure of the limiting equations, and we provide a detailed treatment of the well posedness of the limiting stochastic partial differential equation. This ensures that the particle approximation remains stable and controlled over time. Although similar convergence results have been obtained in two dimensional settings, our study presents the first proof of strong uniform convergence in three dimensions for a stochastic fluid model derived from an interacting particle system. Importantly, our results also yield new insights in the deterministic regime, namely, in the absence of advection noise, where this type of convergence had not been previously established.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of random band matrices at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: specifically, $S_{xy}=0$ whenever the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. We further establish quantum unique ergodicity for delocalized eigenvectors, as well as a rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, including the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010 Banderier and Nicodeme consider the height of bounded discrete bridges and conclude to a limiting Rayleigh distribution. This result is correct although their proof is partly erroneous. They make asymptotic simplifications based upon dominance properties of the roots of the kernel of the walk within a disk centered at the origin, but these dominance properties apply only upon a positive real segment. However the very good agreement of simulations with their asymptotic expansion of the probability distribution in case of {\L}ukasiewicz bridges let us think that their proof could be corrected. This is the scope of the present article which provides a proof using the dominance property only in its domain of validity. We also consider the case of periodic walks, a topic not considered in Banderier-Nicodeme2010. We limit ourselves to walks whose characteristic polynomial decomposes over $\bC$ without repeated factors.</description>

Abstract: We describe the formalization of the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem, showing the existence of a probability measure on the space of trajectories of a Markov chain, in the proof assistant Lean using the integrated library Mathlib. We first present a mathematical proof before exposing the difficulties which arise when trying to formalize it, and how they were overcome. We then build on this work to formalize the construction of the product of an arbitrary family of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi equations from mean-field spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12732v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a meaning to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation arising from mean-field spin glass models in the viscosity sense, and establish the corresponding well-posedness. Originally defined on the set of monotone probability measures, these equations can be interpreted, via an isometry, to be defined on an infinite-dimensional closed convex cone with an empty interior in a Hilbert space. We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf--Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf--Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>Deep neural networks with ReLU, leaky ReLU, and softplus activation provably overcome the curse of dimensionality for Kolmogorov partial differential equations with Lipschitz nonlinearities in the $L^p$-sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several deep learning (DL) methods for approximating high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) have been proposed. The interest that these methods have generated in the literature is in large part due to simulations which appear to demonstrate that such DL methods have the capacity to overcome the curse of dimensionality (COD) for PDEs in the sense that the number of computational operations they require to achieve a certain approximation accuracy $\varepsilon\in(0,\infty)$ grows at most polynomially in the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb N$ and the reciprocal of $\varepsilon$. While there is thus far no mathematical result that proves that one of such methods is indeed capable of overcoming the COD, there are now a number of rigorous results in the literature that show that deep neural networks (DNNs) have the expressive power to approximate PDE solutions without the COD in the sense that the number of parameters used to describe the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb N$ and the reciprocal of the approximation accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Roughly speaking, in the literature it is has been proved for every $T&gt;0$ that solutions $u_d\colon [0,T]\times\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$, $d\in\mathbb N$, of semilinear heat PDEs with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated by DNNs with ReLU activation at the terminal time in the $L^2$-sense without the COD provided that the initial value functions $\mathbb R^d\ni x\mapsto u_d(0,x)\in\mathbb R$, $d\in\mathbb N$, can be approximated by ReLU DNNs without the COD. It is the key contribution of this work to generalize this result by establishing this statement in the $L^p$-sense with $p\in(0,\infty)$ and by allowing the activation function to be more general covering the ReLU, the leaky ReLU, and the softplus activation functions as special cases.</description>

      <title>Tunable correlation retention: A statistical method for generating synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to generate statistically representative synthetic data from a given dataset. The main goal of our method is for the created data set to mimic the inter--feature correlations present in the original data, while also offering a tunable parameter to influence the privacy level. In particular, our method constructs a statistical map by using the empirical conditional distributions between the features of the original dataset. Part of the tunability is achieved by limiting the depths of conditional distributions that are being used. We describe in detail our algorithms used both in the construction of a statistical map and how to use this map to generate synthetic observations. This approach is tested in three different ways: with a hand calculated example; a manufactured dataset; and a real world energy-related dataset of consumption/production of households in Madeira Island. We evaluate the method by comparing the datasets using the Pearson correlation matrix with different levels of resolution and depths of correlation. These two considerations are being viewed as tunable parameters influencing the resulting datasets fidelity and privacy. The proposed methodology is general in the sense that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable in a much broader context than indicated here.</description>

Abstract: We consider two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, with possibly different parameters, and study two isomorphism problems, a graph embedding problem and a common subgraph problem. Under certain conditions on the graph parameters we show a sharp asymptotic phase transition as the graph sizes tend to infinity. This extends known results for the case of uniform Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, naturally leading to several related problems for further exploration.</description>

Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>

Abstract: Inspired from Milman's observation, we prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds for centered convex sets and characterize the case of equality. Furthermore, we confirm a nonsymmetric version of the inequality proposed by Szarek--Werner. The existing arguments due to Royen and Milman are seemingly difficult to be applied for these purposes since both of them involve certain approximation arguments that reduce the inequality to some weaker form. To overcome this difficulty, we generalize our previous work on the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>
