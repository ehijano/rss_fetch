      <title>Oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics driven by surface curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chimera states in neural networks and power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial, frustrated synchronization and chimera-like states are expected to occur in Kuramoto-like models if the spectral dimension of the underlying graph is low: $d_s &lt; 4$. We provide numerical evidence that this really happens in case of the high-voltage power grid of Europe ($d_s &lt; 2$), a large human connectome (KKI113) and in case of the largest, exactly known brain network corresponding to the fruit-fly (FF) connectome ($d_s &lt; 4$), even though their graph dimensions are much higher, i.e.: $d^{EU}_g\simeq 2.6(1)$ and $d^{FF}_g\simeq 5.4(1)$, $d^{\mathrm{KKI113}}_g\simeq 3.4(1)$. We provide local synchronization results of the first- and second-order (Shinomoto) Kuramoto models by numerical solutions on the FF and the European power-grid graphs, respectively, and show the emergence of \red{chimera-like} patterns on the graph community level as well as by the local order parameters.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Evolution beats random chance: Performance-dependent network evolution for enhanced computational capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand structure-function relationships in networks across scientific disciplines has intensified. However, the optimal network architecture remains elusive, particularly for complex information processing. Therefore, we investigate how optimal and specific network structures form to efficiently solve distinct tasks using a novel framework of performance-dependent network evolution, leveraging reservoir computing principles. Our study demonstrates that task-specific minimal network structures obtained through this framework consistently outperform networks generated by alternative growth strategies and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. Evolved networks exhibit unexpected sparsity and adhere to scaling laws in node-density space while showcasing a distinctive asymmetry in input and information readout nodes distribution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic for quantifying task complexity from performance-dependently evolved networks, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of network structure-function relationships. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of process-specific network evolution but also shed light on the design and optimization of complex information processing mechanisms, notably in machine learning.</description>
