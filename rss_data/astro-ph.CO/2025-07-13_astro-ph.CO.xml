      <title>DESI and fast radio burst used to constrain modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters of modified theories of gravity. Thus, we present a model supported in $f(R)$ gravity involving a function of the Ricci scalar named Starobinsky-type with the peculiarity that the Non-commutative essence is intrinsic to the coefficients. Additionally, to understand the dynamics within a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe, we explore the possibility of deriving a Friedman equation (in measure) that results from an adequate mathematical treatment. As we mention previously, to test the outlined model, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis is implemented, using Cosmic Chronometers, type Ia supernovae, Hydrogen II galaxies, Intermediate-luminosity quasars, Baryon Acoustic oscillations and Fast Radio Bursts data, to constraint the free parameters of the model and presenting $H(z)$, $q(z)$ and $\omega_{eff}(z)$. The final results are compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model and it is presented a robust discussion about the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters in specific of a modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Hill's equation parameters and application to cosmic reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation provides a compelling framework for explaining several observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields, and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.</description>

      <title>Constraining decaying dark matter models with gravitational lensing and cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite overwhelming observational evidence for dark matter, we still have no evidence of direct detection. Consequently, our knowledge about dark matter is limited, for example, we do not know if dark matter is a stable particle or if it decays. Without a theoretical particle model, the parameter space of possible decay models is highly variable, and astrophysical or cosmological means of indirectly constraining the phenomenological models are required. This paper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark daughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model is parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark matter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a simpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as regions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter. It was found that the growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to imprints at the present day. Here we extend our study and improve the method used to model the decay. We also study the gravitational weak-lensing signal that will be able to detect or constrain the parameter space of decaying dark matter. The results of this study suggest that future weak lensing surveys may provide unique probes of the phenomological parameters of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Beyond LambdaCDM: How the Hubble tension challenges early universe physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local universe and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This tension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes and/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions include physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate common features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant tension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound horizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within the standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current measurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately) 1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple extensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model affects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to LambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and Bayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the size of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we also show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE. The Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned parameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence across a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more sophisticated models are required. We conclude that if the Hubble tension were to be related to the physics of the early universe, EDE could be used as a window to explore conditions of the early universe and extend our understanding of that era.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations. A combined strong and weak lensing solution for Abell 2390 beyond its virial radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclid is presently mapping the distribution of matter in the Universe in detail via the weak lensing (WL) signature of billions of distant galaxies. The WL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to distances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass. Near the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an issue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can diminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide high-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of clusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early Release Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's wide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the visible band of 0."13 and sampling of 0."1 per pixel, we constrain the density profile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc &lt; r &lt; 2000 kpc, from the inner region near the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster. We find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of this cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak lensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined SL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \pm 0.29)\times10^{15}\, \Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\pm0.13 \, {\rm Mpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation. The profile is well described by an NFW model with concentration c=6.5 and a small-scale radius of 230 kpc in the 30\,kpc $&lt; r &lt;$ 2000\,kpc range that is best constrained by SL and WL data. Abell 2390 is the first of many examples where Euclid data will play a crucial role in providing masses for clusters.</description>

      <title>Tracing Missing Baryons in the Cosmic Filaments with tSZ and CMB-Lensing Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in cosmic filaments by stacking approximately 31,300 filaments across the northern and southern SDSS sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $3 \times 10^{13}$ solar masses are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at $7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias related to filament inclination with respect to the line of sight, and modeled assuming isothermal, cylindrically symmetric gas distributions. We explore different gas and matter density distributions, focusing on $\beta$-models with $(\alpha, \beta) = (2, 2/3)$ or $(1, 1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and lensing convergence profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and temperature to be $\delta = 5.90^{+4.18}_{-1.98}$ and $T_e = 2.71^{+0.63}_{-0.51} \times 10^6$ K for the standard $\beta$-model. These results suggest that the filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \times$ {\Omega}_b to the cosmic baryon budget.</description>

      <title>Classical Fluid Analogies for Schr\"dinger-Newton Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson formalism has found a number of applications in cosmology, particularly in describing the growth by gravitational instability of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by ultra-light scalar particles. Here we investigate the extent to which the behaviour of this and the more general case of a Schr\"odinger-Newton system, can be described in terms of classical fluid concepts such as viscosity and pressure. We also explore whether such systems can be described by a pseudo-Reynolds number as for classical viscous fluids. The conclusion we reach is that this is indeed possible, but with important restrictions to ensure physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Structures in generalized mass-to-horizon relation Entropic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of cosmic structures in the thermodynamically consistent generalised mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology (MHEC). For the Bekenstein case the entropic energy density augments the Friedmann equations without modifying the Hawking temperature and automatically satisfies the Clausius relation, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies that afflicted earlier entropy-force models. We then derive the linear perturbation equations, emphasising the distinction between a fully perturbed interaction term and the common approximation in which the perturbation is neglected. Numerical solutions show that fully perturbed follows the LCDM matter-growth history within the current growth uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that MHEC matches both background and growth probes as well as LCDM without extra free parameters, providing a viable entropic explanation for recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ or lower. In this work, we improve the later solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectra relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.</description>

      <title>The optimal Pad\'{e} polynomial for reconstruction of luminosity distance based on 10-fold cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmography known as the Pad\'{e} polynomials has been widely used in the reconstruction of luminosity distance, and the orders of Pad\'{e} polynomials influence the reconstructed result derived from Pad\'{e} approximation. In this paper, we present a more general scheme of selecting optimal Pad\'{e} polynomial for reconstruction of luminosity distance based on 10-fold cross-validation. Then the proposed scheme is applied to Pantheon+ dataset. The numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed procedure has a remarkable ability to distinguish Pad\'{e} approximations with different orders for the reconstruction of the luminosity distance. We conclude that the (2,1) Pad\'e approximation is the optimal approach that can well explain Pantheon+ data at low and high red-shifts. Future applications of this scheme could help choose the optimal model that is more suitable for cosmological observation data at hand and gain a deeper understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic effective theories for fields with general potentials and their implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: High-redshift measurement of structure growth from the cross-correlation of Quaia quasars and CMB lensing from ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$ PR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the amplitude of matter fluctuations over a wide range of redshifts by combining CMB lensing observations from ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 with the overdensity of quasars from Quaia, a $\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{unWISE}$ quasar catalog. Our analysis includes the CMB lensing power spectrum from ACT DR6, the auto-correlation of two Quaia quasar samples centered at $z \simeq 1.0$ and $z \simeq 2.1$, and their cross-correlations with CMB lensing from both ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$ PR4. By performing a series of contamination and systematic null tests, we find no evidence for contamination in the lensing maps, contrary to what was suggested in previous Quaia cross-correlation analyses using $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 CMB lensing data. From the joint analysis of the quasar auto- and cross-correlations with CMB lensing, and including BOSS BAO data to break the degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.802^{+0.045}_{-0.057}$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from $\textit{Planck}$ primary CMB measurements. Combining the CMB lensing auto-spectrum with the cross-correlation measurement improves the constraint on $\sigma_8$ by $12\%$ relative to the lensing auto-spectrum alone, yielding $\sigma_8 = 0.804 \pm 0.013$. This dataset combination also enables a reconstruction of structure growth across redshifts. We infer a $12\%$ constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $z &gt; 3$, with a measurement at the median redshift of the signal of $\sigma_8(\tilde{z}=5.1) = 0.146^{+0.021}_{-0.014}$, consistent with $\textit{Planck}$ at the $1.4\sigma$ level. These results provide one of the highest redshift constraints on the growth of structure to date.</description>

      <title>A candidate field for deep imaging of the Epoch of Reionization observed with MWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep imaging of structures from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in five targeted fields is one of the highest priority scientific objectives for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Selecting 'quiet' fields, which allow deep imaging, is critical for future SKA CD/EoR observations. Pre-observations using existing radio facilities will help estimate the computational capabilities required for optimal data quality and refine data reduction techniques. In this study, we utilize data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II extended array for a selected field to study the properties of foregrounds. We conduct deep imaging across two frequency bands: 72-103 MHz and 200-231 MHz. We identify up to 2,576 radio sources within a 5-degree radius of the image center (at RA (J2000) $8^h$ , Dec (J2000) 5{\deg}), achieving approximately 80% completeness at 7.7 mJy and 90% at 10.4 mJy for 216 MHz, with a total integration time of 4.43 hours and an average RMS of 1.80 mJy. Additionally, we apply a foreground removal algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and calculate the angular power spectra of the residual images. Our results indicate that nearly all resolved radio sources can be successfully removed using PCA, leading to a reduction in foreground power. However, the angular power spectra of the residual map remains over an order of magnitude higher than the theoretically predicted CD/EoR 21 cm signal. Further improvements in data reduction and foreground subtraction techniques will be necessary to enhance these results.</description>

      <title>Gas of thin tubes of massless scalar field as a possible model of unified dark fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the influence of constants that characterize the motion of thin tubes of a massless scalar field (TToMSF) in a gas on the global properties of such a gas, in particular, on its ability to accelerated expansion. The peculiarity of the TToMSF gas is related to the fact that the parameter of its equation of state $w$ depends on the degree of rarefaction of the gas and can take values in a very wide range of values $-1&lt; w &lt;1$. In this case, fluctuations in the density of the TToMSF gas, caused by its gravitational interaction with non-uniformly distributed baryonic matter, should lead to the implementation of local equations of state with different values and different laws of change of the parameter $w$. The possibility of implementing local equations of state can alleviate the tensions associated with the observed non-uniformity of the distribution of matter and the growth of structures in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Singularities in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects are expected to modify the cosmological dynamics of the early universe while maintaining some (potentially discrete) notion of space-time structure. In one approach, loop quantum cosmology, current models are shown here to either be incompatible with a consistent space-time structure, or to have physical singularities. The latter happens in spite of a non-zero scale factor in the isotropic background dynamics. A new effective Friedmann equation shows that a bounce is obtained at sub-Planckian densities, preceded by a physical singularity at infinite scale factor that resembles a time-reversed big rip. The entire phase is accompanied by rapid changes of the Hubble radius. In addition, a new version of perturbative inhomogeneity in loop quantum cosmology is introduced that maintains a consistent space-time structure and has a non-singular background dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum production of gravitational waves after inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to these high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Triggering and quenching in the shadow of AGN: How does AGN proximity affect star formation in the EAGLE simulation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Weyl potential evolution from the first three years of Dark Energy Survey data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl potential, which is the sum of the spatial and temporal distortions of the Universe's geometry, provides a direct way of testing the theory of gravity and the validity of the $\Lambda$CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model. Here we present measurement of the Weyl potential at four redshifts bins using data from the first three years of observations of the Dark Energy Survey. We find that the measured Weyl potential is 2$\sigma$, respectively 2.8$\sigma$, below the $\Lambda$CDM predictions in the two lowest redshift bins. We show that these low values of the Weyl potential are at the origin of the tension between Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and weak lensing measurements, regarding the parameter $\sigma_8$ which quantifies the clustering of matter. Interestingly, we find that the tension remains if no information from the Cosmic Microwave Background is used. Dark Energy Survey data on their own prefer a high value of the primordial fluctuations, together with a slow evolution of the Weyl potential. An important feature of our method is that the measurements of the Weyl potential are model-independent and can therefore be confronted with any theory of gravity, allowing efficient tests of models beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Galaxy Cluster Mass Maps using Score-based Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to reconstruct gas and dark matter projected density maps of galaxy clusters using score-based generative modeling. Our diffusion model takes in mock SZ and X-ray images as conditional inputs, and generates realizations of corresponding gas and dark matter maps by sampling from a learned data posterior. We train and validate the performance of our model by using mock data from a cosmological simulation. The model accurately reconstructs both the mean and spread of the radial density profiles in the spatial domain, indicating that the model is able to distinguish between clusters of different mass sizes. In the spectral domain, the model achieves close-to-unity values for the bias and cross-correlation coefficients, indicating that the model can accurately probe cluster structures on both large and small scales. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of score models to learn a strong, nonlinear, and unbiased mapping between input observables and fundamental density distributions of galaxy clusters. These diffusion models can be further fine-tuned and generalized to not only take in additional observables as inputs, but also real observations and predict unknown density distributions of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Tomographic analysis of galaxy angular density and redshift fluctuations in Data Release 3. Constraints on photo-$z$ errors, linear bias, and peculiar velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS) is a {\it spectro-photometric} survey covering about 3,000~deg$^2$ in its third data release (DR3), and containing about 300,000 galaxies with high quality ({\it odds}$&gt;0.8$) photometric redshifts (hereafter photo-$z$s). We use this galaxy sample to conduct a tomographic study of the counts and redshift angular fluctuations under Gaussian shells sampling the redshift range $z\in[0.05,0.25]$. We confront the angular power spectra of these observables measured under shells centered on 11 different redshifts with theoretical expectations derived from a linear Boltzmann code ({\tt ARFCAMB}). Overall we find that J-PLUS DR3 data are well reproduced by our linear, simplistic model. We obtain that counts (or density) angular fluctuations (hereafter ADF) are very sensitive to the linear galaxy bias $b_g(z)$, although weakly sensitive to radial peculiar velocities of the galaxy field, while suffering from systematics residuals for $z&gt;0.15$. Angular redshift fluctuations (ARF), instead, show higher sensitivity to radial peculiar velocities and also higher sensitivity to the average uncertainty in photo-$z$s ($\sigma_{\rm Err}$), with no obvious impact from systematics. For $z&lt;0.15$ both ADF and ARF agree on measuring a monotonically increasing linear bias varying from $b_g(z=0.05)\simeq 0.9\pm 0.06$ up to $b_g(z=0.15)\simeq 1.5\pm 0.05$, while, by first time, providing consistent measurements of $\sigma_{\rm Err}(z)\sim 0.014$ that are $\sim 40~\%$ higher than estimates from the photo-$z$ code {\tt LePhare}, ($\sigma_{\rm Err}^{\rm LePhare}=0.010$). As expected, this photo-$z$ uncertainty level prevents the detection of radial peculiar velocities in the modest volume sampled by J-PLUS DR3, although prospects for larger galaxy surveys of similar (and higher) photo-$z$ precision are promising.</description>

      <title>The J-PLUS collaboration. Additive versus multiplicative systematics in surveys of the large scale structure of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational and/or astrophysical systematics modulating the observed number of luminous tracers can constitute a major limitation in the cosmological exploitation of surveys of the large scale structure of the universe. Part of this limitation arises on top of our ignorance on how such systematics actually impact the observed galaxy/quasar fields. In this work we develop a generic, hybrid model for an arbitrary number of systematics that may modulate observations in both an additive and a multiplicative way, after applying a nonlinear power law transformation. This model allows us devising a novel algorithm that addresses the identification and correction for either additive and/or multiplicative contaminants. We test this model on galaxy mocks and systematics templates inspired from data of the third data release of the {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS). We find that our method clearly outperforms standard methods that assume either an additive or multiplicative character for all contaminants in scenarios where both characters are actually acting on the observed data. In simpler scenarios where only an additive or multiplicative imprint on observations is considered, our hybrid method does not lie far behind the corresponding simplified, additive/multiplicative methods. Nonetheless, in scenarios of mild/low impact of systematics, we find that our hybrid approach converges towards the standard method that assumes additive contamination, as predicted by our model describing systematics. Our methodology also allows for the estimation of biases induced by systematics residuals on different angular scales and under different observational configurations, although these predictions necessarily restrict to the subset of {\em known/identified} potential systematics, and say nothing about ``unknown unknowns" possibly impacting the data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave lensing: probing Fuzzy Dark Matter with LISA</title>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations.</description>

      <title>The Preference for Evolving Dark Energy from Cosmological Distance Measurements and Possible Signatures in the Growth Rate of Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use a flexible parametrization of the equation of state of dark energy to explore its possible evolution with datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Planck cosmic microwave background, and either the 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the Pantheon+ (PP) supernova (SN) compilation. This parametrization, called transitional dark energy, allows for rapid changes in the equation of state but also changes like that in the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We find a 3.8{\sigma} preference for evolving dark energy over {\Lambda}CDM with the DES dataset and a weaker 2.4{\sigma} preference when using the PP dataset. This corroborates the finding of the DESI Collaboration, who found that their baryon acoustic oscillation data preferred evolving dark energy when fit with the CPL parametrization of the equation of state. Our analysis reveals no significant outliers in the DESI data around the TDE best-fit, while the data is asymmetrically distributed around the {\Lambda}CDM best-fit model such that the measured distances are on average smaller. The DESI and SN data both prefer an expansion history that implies a higher dark energy density around z=0.5 than in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, with the inferred equation of state being greater than -1 around z=0 and close to or below -1 at z&gt;0.5. We show that when the expansion rate is greater than that in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model (around z=0.5), the growth rate calculated assuming General Relativity is suppressed relative to the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, and it rebounds as the expansion rate differences between the models become smaller closer to the present time. The resulting flattening of the $f\sigma_8(z)$ curve compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model could be an independent signature of the temporal evolution of dark energy.</description>

      <title>CLASS_SZ II: Notes and Examples of Fast and Accurate Calculations of Halo Model, Large Scale Structure and Cosmic Microwave Background Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are very much work-in-progress and simply intended to showcase, in various degrees of details (and rigour), some of the cosmology calculations that class_sz can do. We describe the class_sz code in C, Python and Jax. Based on the Boltzmann code class, it can compute a wide range of observables relevant to current and forthcoming CMB and Large Scale Structure surveys. This includes galaxy shear and clustering, CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev and Zeldovich observables, Cosmic Infrared Background, cross-correlations and three-point statistics. Calculations can be done either within the halo model or the linear bias model. For standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions, class_sz uses high-accuracy cosmopower emulators of the CMB and matter power spectrum to accelerate calculations. With this, along with efficient numerical integration routines, most class_sz output can be obtained in less than 500 ms (CMB $C_\ell$'s or matter $P(k)$ take $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{ms})$), allowing for fast or ultra-fast parameter inference analyses. Parts of the calculations are "jaxified", so the software can be integrated into differentiable pipelines.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter origin of an LDMX signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed target experiments where beam electrons are focused upon a thin target have shown great potential for probing new physics, including the sub-GeV dark matter (DM) paradigm. However, a signal in future experiments such as the light dark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert its DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM direct detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here illustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical LDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse momentum distributions) is $\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD experiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX signal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior probability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted from the DD data, and used to $\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step, $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present the results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD experiment has to operate with to assert whether $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We find that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\chi$. It varies from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\chi=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for $m_\chi=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Asymmetries: from the early Universe to BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with almost vanishing total baryon-minus-lepton number can evade the usual BBN and CMB constraints if neutrino oscillations lead to perfect flavor equilibration. Solving the momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) describing neutrino oscillations and interactions, we perform the first systematic investigation of this scenario, uncovering a rich flavor structure in stark contradiction to the assumption of simple flavor equilibration. We find (i) a particular direction in flavor space, $\Delta n_e \simeq -2/3 \, (-1) \Delta n_\mu$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, in which the flavor equilibration is efficient and primordial asymmetries are essentially unconstrained, (ii) a minimal washout factor, $\Delta n_e^2|_\mathrm{BBN} \leq 0.03 \, (0.016) \sum_\alpha \Delta n_\alpha^2|_{\mathrm{ini}}$ yielding a conservative estimate for the allowed primordial asymmetries in a generic flavor direction, and (iii) particularly strong or weak washout if one of the initial flavor asymmetries vanishes due to non-adiabatic muon- or electron-driven MSW transitions. These results open up the possibility of a first-order QCD phase transition facilitated by large lepton asymmetries as well as baryogenesis from large and compensated $\Delta n_e =- \Delta n_\mu$ asymmetries. Our first-principles approach of deriving momentum averaged QKEs includes collision terms beyond the damping approximation, energy transfer between the neutrino and electron-photon plasma, and provides a fast and reliable way to investigate the impact of primordial lepton asymmetries at the time of BBN. We publicly release the Mathematica code COFLASY-M on GitHub which solves the QKEs numerically.</description>

      <title>Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis: a $\psi'$SM route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a $\psi'$SM model, which is an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between a few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>
