      <title>Beyond mean-field effects in Josephson oscillations and self-trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional dual-core traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation.
  The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of attractive and repulsive polarons in one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified description of attractive and repulsive polarons, formed in a one-dimensional Bose gas hosting an impurity particle, by obtaining all ground and excited state solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Modeling the impurity with an attractive square-well potential, we characterize the excited-state energy branches as a function of interaction strength. As the impurity-bath coupling increases, the excited states change from distinct soliton configurations to hybridized soliton-polaron states, eventually crossing over from repulsive to attractive polarons at unitarity. We identify a universal regime near this crossover where the polaron properties are accurately characterized by the zero-energy scattering length.</description>

      <title>Lattice-enabled detection of spin-dependent three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental detection of coherent three-body interactions, often masked by stronger two-body effects, through nonequilibrium spin dynamics induced by controllably quenching lattice-confined spinor gases. Three-body interactions are characterized through both real-time and frequency domain analyses of the observed dynamics. Our results, well-described by an extended Bose-Hubbard model, further demonstrate the importance of three-body interactions for correctly determining atom distributions in lattice systems, which has applications in quantum sensing via spin singlets. The techniques demonstrated in this work can be directly applied to other atomic species, offering a promising avenue for future studies of higher-body interactions with broad relevance to strongly-interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dimerization in the SU(4) Heisenberg model on the cubic lattice: iPEPS study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study SU(4)-symmetric Heisenberg model on the cubic lattice with spatially anisotropic magnetic couplings. We utilize several approaches based on the tensor-network representation of the many-body wave functions, which enable accurate analysis of ground-state properties of the model in different regimes of spatial anisotropy including fully isotropic three-dimensional case. Our results point to the persistence of the dimerized color-ordered phase throughout whole range of magnetic couplings excluding only the limit of completely decoupled one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the number of particles. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix to the projection onto the normalized order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Probability-Phase Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we develop a coherence theory for ensembles that exploits the probability-phase structure of the quantum state space. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. First, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$, which measures statistical correlations between measurement-accessible probabilities and measurement-inaccessible phases across an ensemble. Then, we prove this satisfies the axioms of a coherence monotone, establishing it as a bona-fide measure of ensemble-level coherence. Eventually, through the definition of the \emph{coherence surplus} $\delta_{\mathcal{C}} \geq 0$, we show how ensemble coherence relates to, but exceeds, density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying structure lost in statistical averaging.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>
