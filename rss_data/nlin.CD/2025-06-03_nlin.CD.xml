      <title>A State of the Art on Recent Progress and Emerging Challenges on Energy Transfer Between Vibrating Modes Under an External Mechanical Force With Time-Varying Frequency From 2020 to 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an example of current importance with a future perspective in engineering, in which excitation sources always have limited power, limited inertia, and their frequencies vary according to the instantaneous state of the vibrating system. Practical examples of non-ideal systems are considered. The most common phenomenon for this kind of system is discussed. The period considered is from 2020 to 2025. The specific properties of various models are also discussed. Directions for future investigations are provided. In this paper, the authors revisited some publications based on the assumption that the external excitations are produced by non-ideal sources (RNIS), that is, with limited power supply. Among these applications, nonlinear phenomena such as the Sommerfeld effect and saturation phenomenon were observed, considering fractional damping. Energy harvesters and the Jacobi-Anger expansion were used in the governing equations of motion. We also used the Jacobi-Anger expansion in the case of energy transfer between vibrating modes under an external force with time-varying frequency, which represents one of the future directions of research on non-ideal vibrating systems (RNIS).</description>

      <title>Suppressing parametric resonance of a Hyperloop vehicle using a parametric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of a simple model of a Hyperloop vehicle resulting from the interaction between electromagnetic and aeroelastic forces for both constant and periodically varying coefficients (i.e., parametric excitation). For the constant coefficients, through linear stability analysis, we analytically identify three distinct regions for the physically significant equilibrium point. Further inspection reveals that the system exhibits limit-cycle vibrations in one of these regions. Using the harmonic balance method, we determine the properties of the limit cycle, thereby unravelling the frequency and amplitude that characterize the periodic oscillations of the system's variables. For the varying coefficients case, the stability is studied using Floquet analysis and Hills determinant method. The part of the stability boundary related to parametric resonance has an elliptical shape, while the remaining part remains unchanged. One of the major findings is that a linear parametric force, can suppress or amplify the parametric resonance induced by another parametric force depending on the amplitude of the former. In the context of the Hyperloop system, this means that parametric resonance caused by base excitation-in other words by the linearized parametric electromagnetic force can be suppressed by modulating the coefficient of the aeroelastic force in the same frequency. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the phase difference between the modulation and the base excitation. The origin of the suppression is attributed to the stabilizing character of the parametric aeroelastic force as revealed through energy analysis. We provide analytical expressions for the stability boundaries and for the stability's dependence on the phase shift of the modulation.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>
