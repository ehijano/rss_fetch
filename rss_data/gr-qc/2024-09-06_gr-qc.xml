      <title>Stochastic Metric Fluctuations and Detection of Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic gravity in which the spacetime metric is a random variable and the spacetime manifold is a fluctuating physical system at a certain length scale is investigated. We will propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The Bose-Einstein occupation number $N_g$ for gravitons can be large enough to be the particle components of the gravitational random metric fluctuations in a physical system. The stochastic gravitational noise produced by the gravitons displaces a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations of a large number of gravitons causing a Brownian motion displacement $\Delta x$ of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetry in one-way wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we studied a modified version of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. This modified bridge is traversable and works as a one-way membrane: a particle on the first sheet falling toward the throat will reach it in finite time (in Eddington coordinates), and will continue its trajectory on the second sheet. In this paper, we show that the particle undergoes a PT-symmetry as it crosses the throat. This could lead to observable effects thanks to an additional ingredient proposed by Einstein and Rosen: congruent points on the two sheets are identified. We propose a bimetric model to realize this identification for our modified bridge.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects on Cosmic Scales as an Alternative to Dark Matter and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-torsion theory is a gauge theory approach to gravity that expands upon Einstein's general relativity (GR) by incorporating the spin of microparticles. In this study, we further develop the spin-torsion theory to examine spherically symmetric and static gravitational systems that involve free-falling macroscopic particles. We posit that the quantum spin of macroscopic matter becomes noteworthy at cosmic scales. We further assume that the Dirac spinor and Dirac equation adequately capture all essential physical characteristics of the particles and their associated processes. A crucial aspect of our approach involves substituting the constant mass in the Dirac equation with a scale function, allowing us to establish a connection between quantum effects and the scale of gravitational systems. This mechanism ensures that the quantum effect of macroscopic matter is scale-dependent and diminishes locally, a phenomenon not observed in microparticles. For any given matter density distribution, our theory predicts an additional quantum term, the quantum potential energy (QPE), within the mass expression. The QPE induces time dilation and distance contraction, and thus mimics a gravitational well. When applied to cosmology, the QPE serves as a counterpart to the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein to balance gravity in his static cosmological model. The QPE also offers a plausible explanation for the origin of Hubble redshift (traditionally attributed to the universe's expansion). The predicted luminosity distance--redshift relation aligns remarkably well with SNe Ia data from the cosmological sample of SNe Ia. In the context of galaxies, the QPE functions as the equivalent of dark matter. The predicted circular velocities align well with rotation curve data from the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database) sample.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic viscose accretion disk around a distorted kerr black hole (DKB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin. an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. Additionally, we investigated the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB. We also examined how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Derivation of Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy for Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole was presented earlier by using a non-trivial phase space. It was argued that the Schwarzschild black hole behaves like a 1D quantum mechanical system. In this paper, we show that if we assume the phase space to obey the holographic principle and take the microscopic particles inside the quantum gravitational system to be ideal bosonic gas, we can derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The assumption of the phase space to follow the holographic principle such that the Schwarzschild black hole behaves as a 2D system is very much in the spirit of our understanding of black holes than their behavior as a 1D system. However, the argument suggests that the black hole be treated as a system with the equation of state $P=\rho$.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll inflation from a geometric scalar-tensor model with self-interacting potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider slow-roll inflation in the context of a modified Brans-Dicke dilaton gravity. From a two self-interacting potentials $V(\phi)$, we reproduce a Starobinsky-like potential and, commonly in syperstring models, an exponential tail potential $V(\phi)\sim(1-e^{\alpha_0\phi})$, with $\alpha_0$ being a constant coefficient related to the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. Using the observational bounds on the spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ imposed by Planck-CMB baseline data and the BICEP2/Keck collaboration with combination with Planck 2018 and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations(BAO), we obtain for both models a good agreement with current observations with $n_s = 0.960 - 0.972$ and $r&lt;0.02$. In addition, the resulting large values of $\omega$ suggests a possible linkage of the inflationary regime and today's solar system bounds.</description>

      <title>Spherical Evolution of the Generalized Harmonic Gauge Formulation of General Relativity on Compactified Hyperboloidal Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the successful numerical evolution of the compactified hyperboloidal initial value problem in general relativity using generalized harmonic gauge. We work in spherical symmetry, using a massless scalar field to drive dynamics. Our treatment is based on the dual-foliation approach, proceeding either by using a height function or by solving the eikonal equation to map between frames. Both are tested here with a naive implementation and with hyperboloidal layers. We present a broad suite of numerical evolutions, including pure gauge perturbations, constraint violating and satisfying data with and without scalar field matter. We present calculations of spacetimes with a regular center. For black hole spacetimes we use excision to remove part of the black hole interior. We demonstrate both pointwise and norm convergence at the expected rate of our discretization. We present evolutions in which the scalar field collapses to form a black hole. Evolving nonlinear scalar field perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime, we recover the expected quasinormal frequencies and tail decay rates from linear theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ghost Dark Energy Model in Extended Modified Theory of Symmetric Telleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on developing a generalized ghost dark energy model $f\mathcal{(Q,T)}$ through the correspondence scheme for a non-interacting scenario involving pressureless matter and a power-law scale factor. We analyze the cosmological implications of our model using the equation of state parameter, $\omega_{GGDE}-\omega'_{GGDE}$ and the $r-s$ planes. We also examine stability of the model by considering squared speed of sound parameter. The equation of state parameter shows the phantom era, while the squared speed of sound indicates a stable generalized ghost dark energy model throughout the cosmic evolution. The $\omega_{GGDE}-\omega'_{GGDE}$ plane depicts a freezing region, whereas the $r-s$ plane corresponds to the Chaplygin gas model. We conclude that our results are consistent with the current observational data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the temperatures which characterise the Unruh effect, the Gibbons-Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the Hawking radiation from the black hole horizon acquire the extra factor 2 compared with their traditional values. The reason for that is the coherence of different processes. The combination of the coherent processes also allows us to make the connection between the Schwinger pair production and the Unruh effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of ModMax-de Sitter black holes when perturbed by massless neutral scalar fields. Specifically, we analyze how the relaxation time, defined as the inverse of the fundamental imaginary frequency, varies with respect to two key parameters: the cosmological constant and the nonlinear parameter characterizing the ModMax theory. We explore scenarios both with and without a cosmological constant, focusing on the static charged ModMax black hole configuration. Our results reveal dependencies between the relaxation time and the nonlinear parameter, shedding light on the dynamical properties of these black hole systems. We also show the validity of WKB approximation under consideration.</description>

      <title>The first law of binary black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the first law of binary black hole mechanics played an important unifying role in the gravitational two-body problem. More recently, binary black hole scattering and the application of high-energy physics methods have provided a new avenue into this classical problem. In this Letter, we connect these two themes by extending the first law to the case of scattering orbits. We present derivations based on classical S-matrix, Hamiltonian, and pseudo-Hamiltonian methods, the last of which allows us to include dissipative effects for the first time. Finally, a "boundary to bound" map links this first law to the traditional bound-orbit version. Through this map a little-known observable for scatter orbits, the elapsed proper time, is mapped to the Detweiler redshift for bound orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum imaging-inspired setup for measuring gravitational fields using an atom that emits a photon at one of two possible locations. The atom acquires a gravitationally induced quantum phase that it shares with the photon. By restoring the path identity of the atom after its interaction with the gravitational field, the gravitationally induced phase can be measured using photon interferometry without the need for additional measurements on the atom. Through repeated measurements with varying interferometric setups, the gravitational potential and inertial acceleration can be deduced.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings, metastable strings and ultralight primordial black holes: from NANOGrav to LIGO and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While topologically stable cosmic strings are disfavored by the recent observation of nHz stochastic gravitational waves (GW) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), e.g., NANOGrav, cosmic metastable strings and superstrings are not. However, because the gravitational waves from all classes of strings generally span a wide range of frequencies, they contradict LIGO's non-observation of stochastic gravitational waves at the $f\sim $ 25 Hz band for a substantial string-parameter space favoured by the PTA data. Suppose ultralight primordial black holes ($M_{BH}&lt;10^9$ g) existed in the early universe. In this case, they reduce the amplitude of the GWs at higher frequencies by providing an early matter-dominated phase, alleviating the tension between LIGO observation and PTA data. We show that the recent PTA data complemented by future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) runs plus detectors such as LISA and ET would be able to dapple the properties and further search strategies of such ultralight primordial black holes which are otherwise fairly elusive as they evaporate in the early universe by Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity effects on particle creation and evaporation in a non-commutative black hole via mass deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a gravitational non-commutative black hole by gauging the de Sitter SO(4,1) group and employing the Seiberg-Witten map. Specifically, we examine modifications of non-commutativity represented through mass deformation. Initially, we address modifications to Hawking radiation for bosonic particle modes by analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetimes. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, showing how $\Theta$ introduces a correction to the amplitude associated with particle creation. Additionally, we derive the power spectrum and the Hawking temperature within this framework. We also derive Hawking radiation from a tunneling perspective, leading to expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density. A similar analysis is performed for fermion particles. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical expression for black hole evaporation lifetime and compare our results with recent estimates of non-commutativity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from decaying sources in strong phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during a first-order cosmological phase transition (PT) using the recently introduced Higgsless approach to numerically evaluate the fluid motion induced by the PT. We present for the first time spectra from strong first-order PTs ($\alpha = 0.5$), alongside weak ($\alpha = 0.0046$) and intermediate ($\alpha = 0.05$) transitions previously considered in the literature. We test the regime of applicability of the stationary source assumption, characteristic of the sound-shell model, and show that it agrees with our numerical results when the kinetic energy, sourcing GWs, does not decay with time. However, we find in general that for intermediate and strong PTs, the kinetic energy in our simulations decays following a power law in time, and provide a theoretical framework that extends the stationary assumption to one that allows to include the time evolution of the source. This decay of the kinetic energy, potentially determined by non-linear dynamics and hence, related to the production of vorticity, modifies the usually assumed linear growth with the source duration to an integral over time of the kinetic energy fraction, effectively reducing the growth rate. We validate the novel theoretical model with the results of our simulations covering a broad range of wall velocities. We provide templates for the GW amplitude and spectral shape for a broad range of PT parameters.</description>

      <title>Information conservation in de Sitter tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the three most general cases of progressive de Sitter spacetime. The charged and magnetic particles tunnel into the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter black hole (the most general case of a static black hole), the Kerr-Newman-Kasuya de Sitter black hole (the most general case of a rotating black hole), and Bardeen de Sitter black hole (black hole without singularities). We use Parikh-Wilczek method to calculate the radiation spectra of these black holes respectively, and find that they deviate from the pure thermal spectra, satisfying the unitary principle. Our results support the conservation of information and are generally true for all asymptotic de Sitter space-times.</description>

      <title>Kerr Geodesics in horizon-penetrating Kerr coordinates: description in terms of Weierstrass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the theory of timelike and null geodesics in the (extended) Kerr spacetime. This work is a sequel to a recent paper by Cie\'{s}lik, Hackmann, and Mach, who applied the so-called Biermann-Weierstrass formula to integrate Kerr geodesic equations expressed in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We show that a formulation based on the Biermann-Weierstrass theorem can also be applied in horizon-penetrating Kerr coordinates, resulting in solutions that are smooth across Kerr horizons. Horizon-penetrating Kerr coordinates allow for an explicit continuation of timelike and null geodesics between appropriate regions of the maximal analytic extension of the Kerr spacetime. A part of this work is devoted to a graphic visualisation of such geodesics.</description>

      <title>Extremal rotating BTZ black holes cannot be dressed in (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16056v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the (anti-)self-dual condition for orthonormal components of the Faraday tensor, the 3D Einstein-Maxwell system with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ admits a solution obtained by Kamata and Koikawa and later by Cataldo and Salgado in the most general form. Actually, Clement first obtained this solution and interpreted it as a regular particle-like solution without horizon. Nevertheless, it has been erroneously stated in some literature that this Clement-Cataldo-Salgado (CCS) solution, locally characterized by a single parameter, describes a black hole even in the charged case as it reduces to the extremal rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the vacuum limit and its curvature invariants are constant. In this paper, we supplement Clement's interpretation by showing that there appears a parallelly propagated curvature singularity corresponding to an infinite affine parameter along spacelike geodesics at the location of the Killing horizon in the extremal rotating BTZ solution when the (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field is added. If the spatial coordinate $\theta$ is periodic, closed timelike curves exist near the singularity. It is also shown that the CCS solution is of the Cotton type N (in contrast to charged rotating BTZ black holes which are of type I away from the horizon), and the energy-momentum tensor of the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type II. The metric solves the Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations also with a massless scalar field or a null dust fluid. We demonstrate that it belongs to the Kundt shear-free, non-twisting, non-expanding class of geometries, whereas extremal rotating BTZ black holes have expanding principal null directions. It means that the CCS metric represents the specific null ("radiative") Maxwell field generated by a singular source, rather than an extremal rotating BTZ black hole dressed in an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Glauber-Sudarshan States, Wave Functional of the Universe and the Wheeler-De Witt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the pertinent question in the analysis of de Sitter as an excited state is what happens to the Glauber-Sudarshan states that are off-shell, i.e. the states that do not satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We argue that these Glauber-Sudarshan states, including the on-shell ones, are controlled by a bigger envelope wave functional namely a wave functional of the universe which surprisingly satisfies a Wheeler-De Witt equation. We provide various justification of the aforementioned identification including the determination of the emergent Hamiltonian constraint appearing in the Wheeler-De Witt equation that is satisfied by both the on- and off-shell states. Our analysis provides further evidence of why a transient four-dimensional de Sitter phase in string theory should be viewed as an excited state over a supersymmetric warped Minkowski background and not as a vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Optical sensitivities of current gravitational wave observatories at higher kHz, MHz and GHz frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GEO 600, Kagra, LIGO, and Virgo were built to observe gravitational waves at frequencies in the audio band, where the highest event rates combined with the largest signal to noise ratios had been predicted. Currently, hypothetical sources of cosmological origin that could have produced signals at higher frequencies are under discussion. What is not widely known is that current interferometric GW observatories have a frequency comb of high optical sensitivity that encompasses these high frequencies. Here we calculate the high-frequency noise spectral densities of operating GW observatories under the justified assumption that photon shot noise is the dominant noise source. We explain the underlying physics of why high sensitivity is achieved for all integer multiples of the free spectral ranges of the observatory's resonators when an interferometer arm is not orientated perpendicular to the propagation direction of the GW. Proposals for new concepts of high-frequency GW detectors must be compared with the high-frequency sensitivities presented here.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

Abstract: We reanalyse the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) using an observationally-driven model for ensemble properties of pulsar noise. We show that the revised gravitational wave background properties are in better agreement with theoretical expectations for the strain spectrum. Our improved model for ensemble pulsar noise properties reduces a systematic error at $1\sigma$ level and increases Bayesian odds of Hellings-Downs correlations by $\sim 10\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1704.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have analyzed the transformation from initial coordinates $(v,r)$ of the Vaidya metric with light coordinate $v$ to the most physical diagonal coordinates $(t,r)$. An exact solution has been obtained for the corresponding metric tensor in the case of a linear dependence of the mass function of the Vaidya metric on light coordinate $v$. In the diagonal coordinates, a narrow region (with a width proportional to the mass growth rate of a black hole) has been detected near the visibility horizon of the Vaidya accreting black hole, in which the metric differs qualitatively from the Schwarzschild metric and cannot be represented as a small perturbation. It has been shown that, in this case, a single set of diagonal coordinates $(t,r)$ is insufficient to cover the entire range of initial coordinates $(v,r)$ outside the visibility horizon; at least three sets of diagonal coordinates are required, the domains of which are separated by singular surfaces on which the metric components have singularities (either $g_{00}=0$ or $g_{00}=\infty$.). The energy-momentum tensor diverges on these surfaces; however, the tidal forces turn out to be finite, which follows from an analysis of the deviation equations for geodesics. Therefore, these singular surfaces are exclusively coordinate singularities that can be referred to as false firewalls because there are no physical singularities on them. We have also considered the transformation from the initial coordinates to other diagonal coordinates $(\eta,y)$, in which the solution is obtained in explicit form, and there is no energy-momentum tensor divergence.</description>

      <title>Particle motion around luminous neutron stars: effects of deviation from Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study trajectories of test particles around a luminous, static, spherically symmetric neutron star, under the combined influence of gravity and radiation. In general relativity, for Schwarzschild spacetime, an equilibrium sphere (the Eddington Capture Sphere) is formed for near-Eddington luminosities. We generalize these results to a broad class of static, spherical spacetimes. We also study the dynamics of particles in a strong radiation field in spherical spacetimes. The results are illustrated for two cases, Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime of a charged spherical object in general relativity and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetime, arising from the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Our findings apply to neutron stars under gravitational field equations different from the vacuum Einstein field equations of general relativity, such as in modified theories of gravity, the only requirement being that test particles follow geodesics in the absence of the radiation field. The effects that we describe are, in principle, measurable through observations of X-ray bursts of neutron stars. Hence, detailed future studies could use such observations to test gravity theories in the strong-field regime, provided that the impact of the spacetime geometry can be disentangled from the astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse in effective loop quantum gravity: beyond marginally bound configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational collapse in effective loop quantum gravity, focusing on non-marginally bound configurations in Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes. In the homogeneous limit we recover the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology for Friedman cosmologies with spatial curvature. We study a particular family of configurations with a homogeneous interior and a sharp boundary where the dust energy density rapidly and continuously decreases to zero. For these configurations, the gravitational collapse continues to the Planck regime when a bounce occurs, at which point the dust ball starts to expand, and a shock wave forms in the gravitational field within the order of a Planck time after the bounce. The shock slowly moves outwards, eventually reaching the horizon which then disappears, at which time there is no longer a black hole. If the initial configuration is bound, the shock asymptotes to a maximal radius, whereas for unbound initial configurations the shock escapes to infinity. In all cases, the black hole lifetime is proportional to the square of the black hole mass, and additionally depends on how strongly bound the dust profile is; this last quantity also affects the vacuum region outside the dust profile which is not solely determined by the black hole mass and charge as in spherically symmetric general relativity. We also use numerics to study a wide range of other types of initial configurations, both bound and unbound, with qualitatively similar results.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) influence the arrival times of radio signals coming from pulsars. Here, we investigate the harmonic space approach to describing a pulsar's response to GWs. We derive and discuss the "diagonalized form" of the response, which is a sum of spin-2-weighted spherical harmonics of the GW direction multiplied by normal (spin-weight 0) spherical harmonics of the pulsar direction. We show how this allows many useful objects, for example, the Hellings and Downs two-point function, to be easily calculated. The approach also provides a clear description of the gauge dependence. We then employ this harmonic approach to model the effects of angular correlations in the sky locations of GW sources (sometimes called "statistical isotropy"). To do this, we construct rotationally invariant ensembles made up of many Gaussian subensembles, each of which breaks rotational invariance. Using harmonic techniques, we compute the cosmic covariance and the total covariance of the Hellings and Downs correlation in these models. The results may be used to assess the impact of angular source correlations on the Hellings and Downs correlation, and for optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs curve in models where GW sources have correlated sky locations.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Being Symmetric: Flat Rotation Curves from Exact Axisymmetric Static Vacuum Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the vacuum Einstein Field Equations and a static axisymmetric ansatz, we find two new exact solutions describing an axisymmetric static vacuum spacetime with cylindrical symmetry: One of this exhibits an additional symmetry in $z$-direction and the other has $z$-coordinate dependent coefficients. In analogy to the Schwarzschild solution, these metrics describe a static vacuum spacetime and apply in similar settings except for the changed symmetry conditions. Furthermore, we consider an approximate solution built on the cylinder solution which asymptotically approaches the Minkowski metric. Analyzing the low-velocity limit corresponding to the Newtonian approximation of the Schwarzschild metric, we find an effective logarithmic potential. This yields flat rotation curves for test particles undergoing rotational motion within the spacetime described by the line elements, in contrast to Newtonian rotation curves. The analysis highlights how important the symmetry assumptions are for deriving general relativistic solutions.
  One example of physical objects that are generally described in the static vacuum low-velocity limit (reducing to Newtonian gravity in the spherically symmetric case) and exhibit axial symmetry are disk galaxies. We show that symmetries and appropriate line elements that respect them are crucial to consider in such settings. In particular, the solutions presented here result in flat rotation curves without any need for dark matter. While these solutions are limited to static vacuum spacetimes, their application to physical galaxies relies on appropriate approximations. Nonetheless, they offer valuable insights into explanations for flat rotation curves in galaxies and their implications for dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Review of Stable, Traversable Wormholes in f (R) Gravity Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods to minimize the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity, and in this review paper, we first explore modified gravity theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in such theories, including Lovelock gravity and Einstein Dilaton Gauss Bonnet gravity. For completeness, we have also reviewed other wormholes such as Casimir wormholes, dark matter halo wormholes, thin-shell wormholes, and Nonlocal Gravity wormholes, where alternative techniques are used to either avoid or reduce the amount of exotic matter that is required.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>

Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions" were needed. Wald and Chandrasekhar further expanded this idea. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, some questionable in their validity. Here, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler (hereafter MTW73). Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH, so violating energy conservation. The accompanying paper, accounting for the existence of the BH irreducible mass, introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation and leads to a new energy extraction process.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr black hole (BH), in turn leading to its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This also allowed the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations, soon followed by the concepts of "extracted" and "extractable" energy. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show the processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, the particle that the BH captures causes an increase of the irreducible mass (so the BH horizon), much larger than the extracted energy. The energy extraction process stops {when the BH reaches a positive spin lower limit set by the process boundary conditions}. Thus, the reaching of a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state through this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for selected decay radii and incoming particle with rest mass $1\%$ of the BH initial mass $M_0$. For $r= 1.2 M$ and $1.9 M$, the sequence stops after $8$ and $34$ decays, respectively, at a spin $0.991$ and $0.857$, the energy extracted has been only $1.16\%$, and $0.42\%$, the extractable energy is reduced by $17\%$ and $56\%$, and the irreducible mass increases by $5\%$ and $22\%$, all values in units of $M_0$. These results show the highly nonlinear change of the BH parameters, dictated by the BH mass-energy formula, and that the BH rotational energy is mainly converted into irreducible mass. Thus, evaluating the irreducible mass increase in any energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is mandatory.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity at the fourth post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently computed post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational-wave phasing up to 4.5PN order accounts for several novel physical effects in compact binary dynamics such as the {\it tail of the memory, tails of tails of tails and tails of mass hexadecupole and current octupole moments}. Therefore, it is instructive to assess the ability of current-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO/Virgo, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope and space-based detectors like LISA to test the predictions of PN theory at these orders. Employing Fisher information matrix, we find that the projected bounds on the deviations from the logarithmic PN phasing coefficient at 4PN is ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ for XG and 2G detectors, respectively. Similarly, the projected bounds on other three PN coefficients that appear at 4PN and 4.5PN are ${\cal O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$ for XG and ${\cal O}(1)$ for 2G detectors. LISA observations of supermassive BHs could provide the tightest constraints on these four parameters ranging from ${\cal O}(10^{-4}-10^{-2})$. The variation in these bounds are studied as a function of total mass and the mass ratio of the binaries in quasi-circular orbits. These new tests are unique probes of higher order nonlinear interactions in compact binary dynamics and their consistency with the predictions of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transit time of black holes on generalized free energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the thermodynamics and kinetics of black hole phase transitions have garnered attention, particularly with the black hole radius being utilized as an order parameter within a generalized free energy landscape. In this framework, the local minima and maxima of the free energy correspond to stable and unstable states, respectively, while other states on the free energy landscape represent fluctuating black holes. Thermal fluctuations enable transitions between these stable states, and this stochastic kinetic behavior can be effectively described by the probabilistic Fokker-Planck equation.The transit time, defined as the time required for transitions or jumps between states, is a crucial physical quantity in phase transition kinetics, as it helps characterize the switching dynamics. By employing a harmonic transition state approximation, we examine the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black hole phase transition within the context of the generalized free energy landscape. We analytically quantify the transit time and its probability distribution for actual transition events, revealing the relationship between the mean transit time and the prefactor of the classical mean first passage time (MFPT). As the mean transit time decreases, the probability distribution narrows, indicating reduced fluctuations in transit time. These phenomena are connected to the topological structure of the generalized free energy landscape, the curvature of the free energy in both stable and unstable states, and the height of the energy barrier. We conclude that, for black hole phase transitions, the transit time serves as a characteristic timescale that reflects the actual jump time between states or to a transition state. Moreover, its relationship with the prefactor allows for a more precise quantification of the MFPT.</description>

      <title>Repeated measurements on non-replicable systems and their consequences for Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocity in Photon Polarization based on direction of polarizer under Gravitational Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unification of gravity with quantum mechanics is still a terra incognita. Photon polarization measurements offer a unique window for probing the interaction between these two fundamental forces. We have revealed that non-reciprocity in the photon polarization angle can arise by tailoring the quantization axis, which corresponds to the direction of polarizer. Due to this non-reciprocity, the measured polarization angle can become ten times larger than that of gravitationally induced frame rotation in both near-Earth and black hole environments. To verify this finding, we propose an astronomical interferometer composed of satellites with the tailored quantization axis, challenging the conventional view of their triviality in closed paths of a photon. Notably, this non-reciprocity can extend to any rotation in the polarization plane, irrespective of the origins, all of which can dictate polarization rotation. Our findings could offer new opportunities for testing fundamental principles in physics.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Rapid-Turn Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to $1$)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.</description>

      <title>Generalised conditions for rapid-turn inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: large-temperature behaviour and bounds from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a transparent discussion of the high temperature asymptotic behaviour of Cosmology in a dilaton-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (dEGB) scenario of modified gravity with vanishing scalar potential. In particular, we show that it has a clear interpretation in terms of only three attractors (stable critical points) of a set of autonomous differential equations: $w=-\frac{1}{3}$, $w=1$ and $1&lt;w&lt;\frac{7}{3}$, where $w\equiv p/\rho$ is the equation of state, defined as the ratio of the total pressure and the total energy density. All the possible different high-temperature evolution histories of the model are exhausted by only eight paths in the flow of the set of the autonomous differential equations. Our discussion clearly explains why five out of them are characterized by a swift transition of the system toward the attractor, while the remaining three show a more convoluted evolution, where the system follows a meta-stable equation of state at intermediate temperatures before eventually jumping to the real attractor at higher temperatures. Compared to standard Cosmology, the regions of the dEGB parameter space with $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ show a strong enhancement of the expected Gravitational Wave stochastic background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles of the Standard Model. This is due to the very peculiar fact that dEGB allows to have an epoch when the energy density $\rho_{\rm rad}$ of the relativistic plasma dominates the energy of the Universe while at the same time the rate of dilution with $T$ of the total energy density is slower than what usually expected during radiation dominance. This allows to use the bound from BBN to put in dEGB a constraint $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^8 - 10^9$ GeV on the reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm RH}$. Such BBN bound is complementary to late-time constraints from compact binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified gravity theories, and must be screened to evade stringent local tests. This can introduce unusual behaviour in galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we use the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular velocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened theories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and calibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence for a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\Delta G/G_\text{N} &lt; 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\sim$0.01 at Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This implies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example $f_{\mathcal{R}0} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>
