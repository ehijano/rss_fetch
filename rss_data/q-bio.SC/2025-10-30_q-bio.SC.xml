      <title>Capillarity Reveals the Role of Capsid Geometry in HIV Nuclear Translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The protective capsid encasing the genetic material of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been shown to traverse the nuclear pore complex (NPC) intact, despite exceeding the passive diffusion threshold by over three orders of magnitude. This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated, condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's characteristic capsid shape.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>
