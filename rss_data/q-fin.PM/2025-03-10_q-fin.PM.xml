      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Near-Optimal Online Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the problem of online portfolio selection as formulated by Cover (1991), the trader repeatedly distributes her capital over $ d $ assets in each of $ T &gt; 1 $ rounds, with the goal of maximizing the total return. Cover proposed an algorithm, termed Universal Portfolios, that performs nearly as well as the best (in hindsight) static assignment of a portfolio, with an $ O(d\log(T)) $ regret in terms of the logarithmic return. Without imposing any restrictions on the market this guarantee is known to be worst-case optimal, and no other algorithm attaining it has been discovered so far. Unfortunately, Cover's algorithm crucially relies on computing certain $ d $-dimensional integral which must be approximated in any implementation; this results in a prohibitive $ \tilde O(d^4(T+d)^{14}) $ per-round runtime for the fastest known implementation due to Kalai and Vempala (2002). We propose an algorithm for online portfolio selection that admits essentially the same regret guarantee as Universal Portfolios -- up to a constant factor and replacement of $ \log(T) $ with $ \log(T+d) $ -- yet has a drastically reduced runtime of $ \tilde O(d^2(T+d)) $ per round. The selected portfolio minimizes the current logarithmic loss regularized by the log-determinant of its Hessian -- equivalently, the hybrid logarithmic-volumetric barrier of the polytope specified by the asset return vectors. As such, our work reveals surprising connections of online portfolio selection with two classical topics in optimization theory: cutting-plane and interior-point algorithms.</description>
