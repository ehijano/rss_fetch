      <title>Improving DeFi Accessibility through Efficient Liquidity Provisioning with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize liquidity provisioning in Uniswap v3, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol implementing an automated market maker (AMM) model with concentrated liquidity. We model the liquidity provision task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train an active liquidity provider (LP) agent using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The agent dynamically adjusts liquidity positions by using information about price dynamics to balance fee maximization and impermanent loss mitigation. We use a rolling window approach for training and testing, reflecting realistic market conditions and regime shifts. This study compares the data-driven performance of the DRL-based strategy against common heuristics adopted by small retail LP actors that do not systematically modify their liquidity positions. By promoting more efficient liquidity management, this work aims to make DeFi markets more accessible and inclusive for a broader range of participants. Through a data-driven approach to liquidity management, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing development of more efficient and user-friendly DeFi markets.</description>

      <title>Pricing Quanto and Composite Contracts with Local-Correlation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pricing composite and quanto contracts requires a joint model of both the underlying asset and the exchange rate. In this contribution, we explore the potential of local-correlation models to address the challenges of calibrating synthetic quanto forward contracts and composite options quoted in the market. Specifically, we design on-line calibration procedures for generic local and stochastic volatility models. The paper concludes with a numerical study assessing the calibration performance of these methodologies and comparing them to simpler approximations of the correlation structure.</description>

      <title>Mamba Meets Financial Markets: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock markets play an important role in the global economy, where accurate stock price predictions can lead to significant financial returns. While existing transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction, their high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their practicality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To address these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock return prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph neural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by utilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity. The code and datasets are available at github.com/Ali-Meh619/SAMBA.</description>

      <title>SpotV2Net: Multivariate Intraday Spot Volatility Forecasting via Vol-of-Vol-Informed Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpotV2Net, a multivariate intraday spot volatility forecasting model based on a Graph Attention Network architecture. SpotV2Net represents assets as nodes within a graph and includes non-parametric high-frequency Fourier estimates of the spot volatility and co-volatility as node features. Further, it incorporates Fourier estimates of the spot volatility of volatility and co-volatility of volatility as features for node edges, to capture spillover effects. We test the forecasting accuracy of SpotV2Net in an extensive empirical exercise, conducted with the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The results we obtain suggest that SpotV2Net yields statistically significant gains in forecasting accuracy, for both single-step and multi-step forecasts, compared to a panel heterogenous auto-regressive model and alternative machine-learning models. To interpret the forecasts produced by SpotV2Net, we employ GNNExplainer \citep{ying2019gnnexplainer}, a model-agnostic interpretability tool, and thereby uncover subgraphs that are critical to a node's predictions.</description>
