      <title>Delay in electronic vortex states created by multiphoton ionization with single elliptically polarized laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show experimentally and theoretically that vortex-shaped structures in the photoelectron momentum distribution can be observed for atoms interacting with a single intense elliptically polarized laser pulse. Our analysis reveals that these spiral structures are the result of destructive interference of two dominant photoelectron vortex states, which are released into the continuum by strong-field ionization. An electron born into one of those states is temporarily delayed near the atomic core by the combined atomic and laser potential, leading to fast changes in the phase delay with energy for photoelectrons in these vortex states. Our results open the door to studying electron dynamics of vortex states in strong-field ionization.</description>

      <title>Two-photon ionization of the K-shell of a heavy beryllium-like atomic ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the second order of the non-relativistic quantum perturbation theory, the analytical structure and absolute values of the generalized cross-sections of the two-photon resonant single ionization of the K-shell of heavy beryllium-like ions of titanium (Ti18+), chromium (Cr20+), iron (Fe22+) and zinc (Zn26+) atoms were predicted. The complete wave functions of the ground state of the ion and the states of its ionization are obtained in the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. The effects of (a) the occurrence of giant resonances in the subthreshold region of the generalized ionization cross-sections, (b) destructive quantum interference of the probability amplitudes of radiation transitions to intermediate states of p-symmetry, and (c) the leading role of the d-symmetry of the final ionization state in determining the values of the total generalized cross-section in the region of energies of absorbed photons of the hard X-ray range were established. A scheme of the proposed experiment with linearly polarized X-ray photons is presented to verify the theoretical results obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum calculation of the collision-induced line-shape effects in antiprotonic helium and the new accurate ab initio $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He potential energy surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully ab initio calculations of collision-induced broadening and shift of spectral lines in antiprotonic helium ($\bar{p}$He$^{+}$) perturbed by atomic helium. To overcome critical limitations of previous studies, we construct a new highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) that spans a wide range of $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He geometries relevant to all metastable states of the exotic helium atom. Rigorous quantum scattering calculations performed using the new PES yield scattering $S$-matrices from which we extract pressure broadening and shift coefficients for 50 transitions in antiprotonic helium-4 ($\bar{p}^{4}$He$^{+}$). This dataset provides the first rigorous benchmark for earlier semiclassical calculations and establishes a robust theoretical reference for high-precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, which is used to test the fundamental charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry. The results extend to temperatures relevant to non-gaseous phases of helium, supporting a new class of precision measurements. This study introduces a methodological framework for future investigations of other exotic systems, such as pionic or kaonic helium atoms, enabling the development of reference data for high-precision spectroscopy of these species - an essential component for improving the determination of the pion and kaon masses.</description>

      <title>Calculation of double differential cross sections (DDCS) for H(3S) ionization using Bethe and Lewis Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations have been made for the double differential cross section (DDCS) for the ionization of metastable hydrogen atoms in the 3S state by electron and positron impact at energies of 150 eV and 250 eV. The authors implemented the second Born approximation to the multiple scattering theory as their model, evaluated the corresponding analytical expressions using Bethe and Lewis integrals, and numerically computed them using MATLAB. The generated DDCS captures the features of both recoil and binary fragmentation and, at the same time, provides an overall qualitative consistency with earlier studies, although some differences can be found between them at certain emission angles. The present work, therefore, supplies new theoretical reference levels for ionization investigations in hydrogen-like systems, now that no experimental data are available for the metastable 3S state.</description>

      <title>Excitation and ionization by electron impact in transition and super-transition arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the ionization and excitation processes induced by electron impact between two configurations or superconfigurations. Rate coefficients are calculated for transition arrays or super-transition arrays rather than level-to-level transitions. Special attention is given to a series of oxygen-like ions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, specifically silicon, germanium, argon, and krypton. Calculations are performed over a wide temperature range, from 50 to 3000 eV. To facilitate the determination of rates at any temperature and ion charge, the computed rates are fitted with a two-dimensional Chebyshev polynomial expansion, yielding a set of coefficients for practical applications. Additionally, an extension of the Clenshaw algorithm to two dimensions, using the Chebyshev coefficients, is proposed to address numerical challenges and enhance computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy in Yb+ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our progress on multi-ion spectroscopy with Yb+ ions. We first characterized the spatial homogeneity of the magnetic- and the rf-field. Subsequently, to equalize the immense AC Stark shifts of the individual ions in a Coulomb crystal, we utilize a holographic phase plate to convert the Gaussian beam into a flat-top shape. These efforts enable us to excite an 8-ion crystal (172Yb+) on the highly forbidden electric octupole transition. Using 173Yb+ with reduced AC Stark shift, the same beam profile could support the multi-ion operation of 20 ions. This paves the way for future multi-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Non-destructive optical read-out and manipulation of circular Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a F\"orster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Universality of Shallow Global Quenches in Critical Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.</description>

      <title>Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a microwave spectroscopy measurement of the muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ fine structure transition, yielding a transition frequency of $9871.0 \pm 7.0~\mathrm{MHz}$, in agreement with state-of-the-art QED predictions within one standard deviation. In combination with the recent Lamb shift result, the $2P_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ splitting is determined, improving the spectroscopic characterization of the $n=2$ manifold in muonium. These results provide a stringent test of bound-state QED in a purely leptonic system and establish a path toward future searches for Lorentz violation and muon-specific new physics.</description>

      <title>Imaging a chain of strongly correlated Rydberg excitations enabled by F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms are currently a very fast advancing quantum platform. For many interesting and demanding applications, including quantum computation, fast detection of a Rydberg excitation or a Rydberg qubit for information readout would be one of the most desirable developments. We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg excitations. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg atoms due to F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg excitations in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg excitations. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</description>
