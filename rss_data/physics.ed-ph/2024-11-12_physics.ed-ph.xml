      <title>Representing and Analysing Conceptual Understanding of Cloud Physics Using Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution in conceptual understanding of cloud physics among learners from diverse academic backgrounds, using the mathematical framework of graph theory. We provide a diagnosis of the changes occurring along a learner's journey in cloud physics, and of the structure of the discipline and its inherent conceptual complexities. Overall, our results both qualify and quantify the epistemological shift in the description of the life-cycle of a cloud (from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed description of cloud microphysical processes) as learners mature in their understanding of the discipline. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts in the discipline complements and confirms our findings. These can be used by lecturers to tailor their teaching towards the identified expert-like concepts, and by students to anticipate the main complexities in the field during their learning process.</description>

      <title>Moroccan pre-service elementary teachers: attitudes toward STEM education and mobile devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore Moroccan pre-service elementary teachers' attitudes toward integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and the use of mobile devices in integrated STEM education. The research sample was selected using convenience sampling. Data were collected from 226 pre-service teachers in the Bachelor of Education Elementary Specialty (BEES) using a 28-item questionnaire. The validity of the items was tested by factor analysis using the extraction method of principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Reliability tests for the different constructs were conducted by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Frequency, mean, standard deviation and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that pre-service elementary teachers have generally neutral attitudes toward integrated STEM education, and they also showed that pre-service teachers' attitudes toward integrated STEM education do not depend on gender or grade level. However, these attitudes are dependent on pre-university studies. Pre-service teachers with a scientific background have significantly more positive attitudes toward integrated STEM education than their counterparts with a literary background. Furthermore, the results of this study also revealed that pre-service teachers have positive attitudes toward the use of mobile devices in integrated STEM education, and these attitudes are not dependent on gender, grade level, or pre-university studies.</description>
