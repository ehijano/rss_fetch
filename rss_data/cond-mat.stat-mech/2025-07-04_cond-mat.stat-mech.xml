      <title>Thermodynamics: A Clear Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the fundamental equation, this study revisits key thermodynamic concepts in a cohesive and innovative manner. It demonstrates the consistency of thermodynamic theory while addressing and clarifying common misconceptions and errors found in the literature, particularly regarding discussions on heat and work. Although the latter two concepts could potentially be set aside, they can be retained if their various and different definitions are clearly articulated and properly understood. The proposed theoretical framework was tested using the free expansion of an ideal gas, a particularly demanding example due to its abrupt nature. From an educational standpoint, this article is invaluable as it consolidates fundamental yet often subtle concepts in an assertive and comprehensible way. Furthermore, it promotes a clearer and more accessible understanding of thermodynamics, challenging the widespread notion that is inherently difficult to grasp.</description>

      <title>Periodically Driven anharmonic chain: Convergent Power Series and Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of a pinned chain of $2N+1$
  oscillators, indexed by $x \in\{-N,\ldots, N\}$. The system is subjected to an external driving force on the particle at $x=0$, of period $\theta=2\pi/\omega$, and to frictional
  damping $\gamma&gt;0$ at both endpoints $x=-N$ and $N$.
  The oscillators interact with a pinned and nearest neighbor harmonic
  plus anharmonic potentials of the form
  $\frac{\omega_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2 +\nu\left[V(q_x)+U(q_x-q_{x-1}) \right]$, with $V''$ and $U''$
  bounded and $\nu\in \mathbb{R}$.
  We recall the recently proven convergence and the global stability of
  a perturbation series in powers of $\nu$ for
  $|\nu| &lt; \nu_0$, yielding the long time periodic state of the
  system.
  Here $\nu_0$ depends only on the supremum norms of $V''$ and $U''$
  and the distance of the set of non-negative integer multiplicities of
  $\omega$ from the interval $[\omega_0,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4}]$ - the spectrum of
  the infinite harmonic chain for $\nu=0$. We describe also some numerical studies of this system going beyond our rigorous results.</description>

      <title>Is the hyperscaling relation violated below the upper critical dimension in some particular cases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we show our results with new interpretation on the critical exponents of thin films obtained by high-performance multi-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a dozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in this direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used. Large $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is studied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the two-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the renormalization group. While, for $N_z&gt;1$, the critical exponents calculated with the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate slightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of critical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the hyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation and the critical exponents obtained for $N_z&gt;1$ to calculate the dimension of the system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be viewed as an "effective" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We also show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while varying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin film. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order parameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical exponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry breakings. In this case, the 2D hyperscaling does not hold. Another case is the 3D Ising model coupled to the lattice vibration: the critical exponents deviate from the 3D Ising ones, the results suggest the violation of the hyperscaling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds and error correction for faulty coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the nanoscale, random effects govern not only the dynamics of a physical system but may also affect its observation. This work introduces a novel paradigm for coarse graining that eschews the assignment of a unique coarse-grained trajectory to a microscopic one. Instead, observations are not only coarse-grained but are also accompanied by a small chance of error. Formulating the problem in terms of path weights, we identify a condition on the structure of errors that ensures that the observed entropy production does not increase. As a result, the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for estimating entropy production can be extended to this broader class of systems. As an application, we consider Markov networks in which individual transitions can be observed but may be mistaken for each other. We motivate, derive, and illustrate thermodynamic bounds that relate the error sensitivity of the observed entropy production to the strength of the driving and are valid for arbitrary network topologies. If sufficiently many transitions in the network can be observed, redundancies in the coarse-grained trajectories can be used to detect and correct errors, which potentially improves naive estimates of entropy production. We conclude with an outlook on subsequent research on thermodynamic bounds for erroneous coarse graining.</description>

      <title>Learning and Testing Inverse Statistical Problems For Interacting Systems Undergoing Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in situations where data is available, but the underlying model is not. It can therefore be necessary to infer the parameters of the latter starting from the former. Statistical mechanics offers a toolbox of techniques to address this challenge. In this work, we illustrate three of the main methods: the Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood, and Mean-Field approaches. We begin with a thorough theoretical introduction to these methods, followed by their application to inference in several well-known statistical physics systems undergoing phase transitions. Namely, we consider the ordered and disordered Ising models, the vector Potts model, and the Blume-Capel model on both regular lattices and random graphs. This discussion is accompanied by a GitHub repository that allows users to both reproduce the results and experiment with new systems.</description>

      <title>Growth of block diagonal operators and symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalies give rise to novel transport phenomena, including the generation of a current in a relativistic fluid due to the presence of magnetic field or vorticity. We present an exclusive and direct computation of the chiral anomaly within the path integral for a massless fermion on a generic electromagnetic and curved background, including local temperature and chemical potential. We identify new thermodynamical contributions to the anomaly which induce the Chiral Separation and Vortical Effects. Additionally, we show that the anomaly fully vanishes at global equilibrium.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: Evolution of the energy of diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With regard to the three basic states of matter (solid, liquid, gas), the calculation of the heat capacity of liquids in a general form has been considered one of the deepest and most interesting challenges in condensed matter physics, due to the strong, system-specific interactions involved. Notwithstanding the theoretical difficulties, there have recently been significant advances in our understanding of liquids, and the phonon theory of liquids has been proposed. However, this theory uses the virial theorem to calculate the liquid energy. Here, we propose an alternative version of the phonon theory of liquids by taking into account the numbers of oscillating atoms and diffusing atoms, rather than using the virial theorem. A new formula is derived for the liquid energy in both the quantum and the classical anharmonic cases. To verify the proposed approach, theoretical predictions are compared with the experimental specific heat of liquid mercury. Finally, we obtain a new expression for the energy of a supercritical system.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state phases from local reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings. Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools, we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory for polymer elasticity: from molecular kinematics to continuum behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the macroscopic mechanical behavior of polymeric materials from the micro-structural features has remained a challenge for decades. Existing theoretical models often fail to accurately capture the experimental data, due to non-physical assumptions that link the molecule kinematics with the macroscopic deformation. In this work, we construct a novel Hamiltonian for chain segments enabling a unified statistical description of both individual macromolecular chains and continuum polymer networks. The chain kinematics, including the stretch and orientation properties, are retrieved by the thermodynamic observables without phenomenological assumptions. The theory shows that the chain stretch is specified by a simple relation via its current spatial direction and the continuum Eulerian logarithmic strain, while the probability of a chain in this spatial direction is governed by the new Hamiltonian of a single segment. The model shows a significantly improved prediction on the hyperelastic response of elastomers, relying on minimal, physically-grounded parameters.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>

      <title>Interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations in a spin-1/2 anisotropic square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.</description>

      <title>Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

      <title>Imprints of information scrambling on eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Theory of Casimir Forces: A Unified Approach Using Finite-Temperature Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14450v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Estimate of equilibration times of quantum correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit based on Lanczos coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equilibration times $T_\text{eq}$ of local observables in quantum chaotic systems by considering their auto-correlation functions. Based on the recursion method, we suggest a scheme to estimate $T_\text{eq}$ from the corresponding Lanczos coefficients that is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. We numerically find that if the observable eventually shows smoothly growing Lanczos coefficients, a finite number of the former is sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the equilibration time. This implies that equilibration occurs on a realistic time scale much shorter than the life of the universe. The numerical findings are further supported by analytical arguments.</description>

      <title>Are shocks in conserved driven single-file motions with bottlenecks universal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven single-file motion sets the paradigm for wide variety of one-dimensional directed movements, ranging from intracellular transport and urban traffic to ant trails and controlled robot swarms. Motivated by the phenomenologies of these systems in closed geometries, regulated by number conservation and bottlenecks, we explore the domain walls (DWs) or shocks in a conceptual one-dimensional cellular automaton with a fixed particle number and a bottleneck. For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</description>
