      <title>Can large language models assist choice modelling? Insights into prompting strategies and current models capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations. These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs. Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated, and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code. Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers' workflows.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Treatment Effects in Shift-Share Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze heterogenous, nonlinear treatment effects in shift-share designs with exogenous shares. We employ a triangular model and correct for treatment endogeneity using a control function. Our tools identify four target parameters. Two of them capture the observable heterogeneity of treatment effects, while one summarizes this heterogeneity in a single measure. The last parameter analyzes counterfactual, policy-relevant treatment assignment mechanisms. We propose flexible parametric estimators for these parameters and apply them to reevaluate the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. manufacturing employment. Our results highlight substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, which is not captured by commonly used shift-share tools.</description>

      <title>Regional Price Dynamics and Market Integration in the U.S. Beef Industry: An Econometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United States, a leading global producer and consumer of beef, continues to face substantial challenges in achieving price harmonization across its regional markets. This paper evaluates the validity of the Law of One Price (LOP) in the U.S. beef industry and investigates causal relationships among regional price dynamics. Through a series of econometric tests, we establish that regional price series are integrated of order one, displaying non-stationarity in levels and stationarity in first differences. The analysis reveals partial LOP compliance in the Northeast and West, while full convergence remains elusive at the national level. Although no region demonstrates persistent price leadership, Southern prices appear particularly sensitive to exogenous shocks. These findings reflect asymmetrical integration across U.S. beef markets and suggest the presence of structural frictions that hinder complete market unification.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Ensemble Projection of Climate Change and Technological Impacts on Future Crop Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework within a fully probabilistic setting for crop yield estimation, model selection, and uncertainty forecasting under multiple future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. By informing on regional agricultural impacts, this approach addresses broader risks to global food security. Extending an established multivariate econometric crop-yield model to incorporate country-specific error variances, the framework systematically relaxes restrictive homogeneity assumptions and enables transparent decomposition of predictive uncertainty into contributions from climate models, emission scenarios, and crop model parameters. In both in-sample and out-of-sample analyses focused on global wheat production, the results demonstrate significant improvements in calibration and probabilistic accuracy of yield projections. These advances provide policymakers and stakeholders with detailed, risk-sensitive information to support the development of more resilient and adaptive agricultural and climate strategies in response to escalating climate-related risks.</description>

      <title>What Impulse Response Do Instrumental Variables Identify?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroeconomic shocks are often composites of multiple components. We show that the local projection-IV (LP-IV) estimand aggregates component-wise impulse responses with potentially negative weights, challenging its causal interpretation. To address this, we propose identification strategies using multiple sign-restricted IVs or disaggregated data, which recover structurally meaningful responses even when individual LP-IV estimands are non-causal. We also show that, under weak stationarity, the identified sets are sharp and cannot be further narrowed in some key cases. Applications to fiscal and monetary policy demonstrate the practical value of our approach.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box of Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local projections (LPs) are widely used in empirical macroeconomics to estimate impulse responses to policy interventions. Yet, in many ways, they are black boxes. It is often unclear what mechanism or historical episodes drive a particular estimate. We introduce a new decomposition of LP estimates into the sum of contributions of historical events, which is the product, for each time stamp, of a weight and the realization of the response variable. In the least squares case, we show that these weights admit two interpretations. First, they represent purified and standardized shocks. Second, they serve as proximity scores between the projected policy intervention and past interventions in the sample. Notably, this second interpretation extends naturally to machine learning methods, many of which yield impulse responses that, while nonlinear in predictors, still aggregate past outcomes linearly via proximity-based weights. Applying this framework to shocks in monetary and fiscal policy, global temperature, and the excess bond premium, we find that easily identifiable events-such as Nixon's interference with the Fed, stagflation, World War II, and the Mount Agung volcanic eruption-emerge as dominant drivers of often heavily concentrated impulse response estimates.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-asymptotic bounds for the distance to the first-order Edgeworth expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.05780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain explicit bounds on the uniform distance between the cumulative distribution function of a standardized sum $S_n$ of $n$ independent centered random variables with moments of order four and its first-order Edgeworth expansion. Those bounds are valid for any sample size with $n^{-1/2}$ rate under moment conditions only and $n^{-1}$ rate under additional regularity constraints on the tail behavior of the characteristic function of $S_n$. In both cases, the bounds are further sharpened if the variables involved in $S_n$ are unskewed. We also derive new Berry-Esseen-type bounds from our results and discuss their links with existing ones. We finally apply our results to illustrate the lack of finite-sample validity of one-sided tests based on the normal approximation of the mean.</description>
