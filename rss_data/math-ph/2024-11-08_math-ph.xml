      <title>Introducing Multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is easier to investigate phenomena in particle physics geometrically by exploring a real solution to the Dirac-Hestenes equation instead of a complex solution to the Dirac equation. The present research outlines the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation. Since the matrix representation of the complexified (Clifford) geometric algebra $\mathbb{C}\otimes{C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ depends on a parity of $n$, we explore even and odd cases separately. In the geometric algebra ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,3}$, there is a lemma on a unique decomposition of an element of the minimal left ideal into the product of the idempotent and an element of the real even subalgebra. The lemma is used to construct the four-dimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation. The analogous lemma is not valid in the multidimensional case, since the dimension of the real even subalgebra of ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ is bigger than the dimension of the minimal left ideal for $n&gt;4$. Hence, we consider the auxiliary real subalgebra of ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ to prove a similar statement. We present the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation in ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$. We prove that one might obtain a solution to the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation using a solution to the multidimensional Dirac equation and vice versa. We also show that the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation has gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Many-body physics and resolvent algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some advantages of the algebraic approach to many body physics, based on resolvent algebras, are illustrated by the simple example of non-interacting bosons which are confined in compact regions with soft boundaries. It is shown that the dynamics of these systems converges to the spatially homogeneous dynamics for increasing regions and particle numbers and a variety of boundary forces. The corresponding correlation functions of thermal equilibrium states also converge in this limit. Depending on the filling of the regions with particles, the limits can either be spatially homogeneous, including the Bose-Einstein condensates, or they become inhomogeneous with varying, but finite local particle densities. In case of this spontaneous breakdown of the spatial symmetry, the presence of condensates can be established by exhibiting temporal correlations over large temporal distances (memory effects).</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to the Generalized Hydrodynamics Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks, from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on functions of momenta.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity in large $N$ field theories and performance of quantum tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom ($N$) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this ``superadditivity'' phenomenon in large $N$ field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the sucess of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naievely be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be re-phrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this re-phrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.</description>

      <title>Tannakian QFT: from spark algebras to quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative construction of Hopf algebras that represent categories of line operators in topological quantum field theory, in terms of semi-extended operators (spark algebras) on pairs of transverse topological boundary conditions. The construction is a direct implementation of Tannakian formalism in QFT. Focusing on d=3 dimensional theories, we find topological definitions of R-matrices, ribbon twists, and the Drinfeld double construction for generalized quantum groups. We illustrate our construction in finite-group gauge theory, and apply it to obtain new results for B-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, a.k.a. equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory, or supergroup BF theory (including ordinary BF theory with compact gauge group). We reformulate our construction mathematically in terms of abelian and dg tensor categories, and discuss connections with Koszul duality.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $V$ a finite-dimensional representation of $G$. Costello-Gaiotto studied a graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d}_{\mathfrak{g}, V}$ and the associated affine Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that this Lie algebra can be made into a sheaf of Lie algebras over $T^*[V/G]=[\mu^{-1}(0)/G]$, where $\mu: T^*V\to \mathfrak{g}^*$ is the moment map. We identify this sheaf of Lie algebras with the tangent Lie algebra of the stack $T^*[V/G]$. Moreover, we show that there is an equivalence of braided tensor categories between the bounded derived category of graded modules of $\mathfrak{d}_{\mathfrak{g}, V}$ and graded perfect complexes of $[\mu^{-1}(0)/G]$.</description>

      <title>On Positive Vectors in Indefinite Inner Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a linear space equipped with an indefinite inner product $[\cdot, \cdot]$. Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{++}=\{f\in\mathcal{H} \ : \ [f,f]&gt;0\}$ the nonlinear set of positive vectors in $\mathcal{H}$. We demonstrate that the properties of a linear operator $W$ in $\mathcal{H}$ can be uniquely determined by its restriction to $\mathcal{F}_{++}$. In particular, we prove that the bijectivity of $W$ on $\mathcal{F}_{++}$ is equivalent to $W$ being {\em close} to a unitary operator with respect to $[\cdot, \cdot]$. Furthermore, we consider a one-parameter semi-group of operators $W_+ = \{W(t) : t \geq 0\}$, where each $W(t)$ maps $\mathcal{F}_{++}$ onto itself in a one-to-one manner. We show that, under this natural restriction, the semi-group $W_+$ can be transformed into a one-parameter group $U = \{U(t) : t\in\mathbb{R}\}$ of operators that are unitary with respect to $[\cdot, \cdot]$. By imposing additional conditions, we show how to construct a suitable definite inner product $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$, based on $[\cdot, \cdot]$, which guarantees the unitarity of the operators $U(t)$ in the Hilbert space obtained by completing $\mathcal{H}$
  with respect to $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Slow Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal (Gibbs) states is a common task in physics and computer science. Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the cost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like algorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum systems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising model and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization of these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in quantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous to the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and quantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.
  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the mixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low temperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n^\alpha)}$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers also have $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n^\alpha)}$. This applies to models like random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we provide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low constant temperature, improving upon previous bounds of $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(\sqrt n)}$. Finally, for $H = H_0 + h\sum_i X_i$ with $H_0$ diagonal in $Z$ basis, we show that a linear free energy barrier in $H_0$ leads to $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ for local Gibbs samplers at low temperature and small $h$. Even with sublinear barriers, we use Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques to lift classical bottlenecks to quantum ones establishing an asymptotically tight lower bound $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{n^{1/2-o(1)}}$ for the 2D transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Mixing time of quantum Gibbs sampling for random sparse Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing evidence that quantum computers can efficiently prepare low-energy or thermal states of physically relevant interacting quantum systems is a major challenge in quantum information science. A newly developed quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm by Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en provides an efficient simulation of the detailed-balanced dissipative dynamics of non-commutative quantum systems. The running time of this algorithm depends on the mixing time of the corresponding quantum Markov chain, which has not been rigorously bounded except in the high-temperature regime. In this work, we establish a polylog(n) upper bound on its mixing time for various families of random n by n sparse Hamiltonians at any constant temperature. We further analyze how the choice of the jump operators for the algorithm and the spectral properties of these sparse Hamiltonians influence the mixing time. Our result places this method for Gibbs sampling on par with other efficient algorithms for preparing low-energy states of quantumly easy Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have a nested toroidal structure, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extendibility problem for Brauer states, focusing on the symmetric two-sided extendibility and the de Finetti extendibility. By employing the representation theory of the unitary and orthogonal groups, we provide a general recipe for finding the $(n,m)$-extendible and $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states. In the two-sided case we describe the special symmetry that only appears for $(n,n)$-extendible symmetric states. From the concrete form of the commutant to the diagonal action of the orthogonal group, we explicitly determine the set of parameters for which the Brauer states are $(1,2)$-, $(1,3)$- and $(2,2)$-extendible in any dimension $d$. Using the branching rules from $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ to $\mathrm{SO}(d)$, we obtain the set of $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states in low dimensions, and analytically describe the $n\to\infty$ limiting shape for $d=3$. Finally, we derive some general properties pertaining to the extendibility of Werner, isotropic and Brauer states.</description>

      <title>Construction of an invertible mapping to boundary conforming coordinates for arbitrarily shaped toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary conforming coordinates are commonly used in plasma physics to describe the geometry of toroidal domains, for example, in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium solvers. The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium configuration can be approximated with an inverse map, defining nested surfaces of constant magnetic flux. For equilibrium solvers that solve for this inverse map iteratively, the initial guess for the inverse map must be well defined and invertible. Even if magnetic islands are to be included in the representation, boundary conforming coordinates can still be useful, for example to parametrize the interface surfaces in multi-region, relaxed magnetohydrodynamics. Given a fixed boundary shape, finding a valid boundary conforming mapping can be challenging, especially for the non-convex boundaries from recent developments in stellarator optimization. In this work, we propose a new algorithm to construct such a mapping, by solving two Dirichlet-Laplace problems via a boundary integral method. We can prove that the generated harmonic map is always smooth and has a smooth inverse. Furthermore, we can find a discrete approximation of the mapping that preserves this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>

      <title>An exploration of connections and curvature in the presence of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the notions of connections and curvature for general Lie-Rinehart algebras without using smoothness assumptions on the base space. We present situations when a connection exists. E.g., this is the case when the underlying module is finitely generated. We show how the group of module automorphism acts as gauge transformations on the space of connections. When the underlying module is projective we define a version of the Chern character reproducing results of Hideki Ozeki. We discuss various examples of flat connections and the associated Maurer-Cartan equations. We provide examples of Levi-Civita connections on singular varieties and singular differential spaces with non-zero Riemannian curvature. The main observation is that for quotient singularities, even though the metric degenerates along strata, the poles of the Christoffel symbols are removable.</description>

      <title>5d-4d Correspondence in Twisted M-theory on a Conifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study twisted M-theory in a general conifold background, and describe it in terms of a 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory. In an equivalent description as twisted type IIA string theory, the matter degrees of freedom arise from topological strings stretched between stacks of D6-branes. In order to study the 5d Chern-Simons-matter theory with a boundary, we first construct and investigate the properties of a 4d non-commutative gauged chiral WZW model. We prove the gauge invariant coupling of this 4d theory to the bulk 5d Chern-Simons theory defined on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{C}^2 $, and further generalize our results to the 5d Chern-Simons-matter theory. We also investigate the toroidal current algebra of the 4d chiral WZW model that arises from radial quantization along one of the complex planes. Finally, we show that a gauged non-commutative chiral 4d WZW model arises from the partition function for quantum 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons theory with boundaries in the BV-BFV formalism, and further generalize this 5d-4d correspondence to the 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory for the case of adjoint matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every Born Lie algebra can be obtained by the bicross product construction starting from two pseudo-Riemannian Lie algebras. We then obtain a classification of all Lie algebras up to dimension four and all six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting an integrable Born structure. Finally, we study the curvature properties of the pseudo-Riemannian metrics of the integrable Born structures obtained in our classification results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra, as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. The construction is achieved by defining generators through magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, specifically for the N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric deformed algebras. This approach reveals a structural parallel between the deformed algebra in quantum superspace and its manifestation in Bloch electron systems.</description>

      <title>Peregrine solitons and resonant radiation in cubic and quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the fascinating phenomena of resonant radiation emitted by transient rogue waves in cubic and quadratic nonlinear media, particularly those shed from Peregrine solitons, one of the main wavepackets used today to model real-world rogue waves. In cubic media, it turns out that the emission of radiation from a Peregrine soliton can be attributed to the presence of higher-order dispersion, but is affected by the intrinsic local longitudinal variation of the soliton wavenumber. In quadratic media, we reveal that a two-color Peregrine rogue wave can resonantly radiate dispersive waves even in the absence of higher-order dispersion, subjected to a phase-matching mechanism that involves the second harmonic wave, and to a concomitant difference-frequency generation process. In both cubic and quadratic media, we provide simple analytic criteria for calculating the radiated frequencies in terms of material parameters, showing excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal random covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Convergence efficiency of quantum gates and circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum circuit models where the gates are drawn from arbitrary gate ensembles given by probabilistic distributions over certain gate sets and circuit architectures, which we call stochastic quantum circuits. Of main interest in this work is the speed of convergence of stochastic circuits with different gate ensembles and circuit architectures to unitary t-designs. A key motivation for this theory is the varying preference for different gates and circuit architectures in different practical scenarios. In particular, it provides a versatile framework for devising efficient circuits for implementing $t$-designs and relevant applications including random circuit and scrambling experiments, as well as benchmarking the performance of gates and circuit architectures. We examine various important settings in depth. A key aspect of our study is an "ironed gadget" model, which allows us to systematically evaluate and compare the convergence efficiency of entangling gates and circuit architectures. Particularly notable results include i) gadgets of two-qubit gates with KAK coefficients $\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5}),\frac{\pi}{8},\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5})\right)$ (which we call $\chi$ gates) directly form exact 2- and 3-designs; ii) the iSWAP gate family achieves the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs under mild conjectures with numerical evidence, even outperforming the Haar-random gate, for generic many-body circuits; iii) iSWAP + complete graph achieve the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs among all graph circuits. A variety of numerical results are provided to complement our analysis. We also derive robustness guarantees for our analysis against gate perturbations. Additionally, we provide cursory analysis on gates with higher locality and found that the Margolus gate outperforms various other well-known gates.</description>

      <title>Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>On the Nonlinear Eshelby Inclusion Problem and its Isomorphic Growth Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the late 1950's, Eshelby's linear solutions for the deformation field inside an ellipsoidal inclusion and, subsequently, the infinite matrix in which it is embedded were published. The solutions' ability to capture the behavior of an orthotropically symmetric shaped inclusion made it invaluable in efforts to understand the behavior of defects within, and the micromechanics of, metals and other stiff materials throughout the rest of the 20th century. Over half a century later, we wish to understand the analogous effects of microstructure on the behavior of soft materials; both organic and synthetic; but in order to do so, we must venture beyond the linear limit, far into the nonlinear regime. However, no solutions to these analogous problems currently exist for non-spherical inclusions. In this work, we present an accurate semi-inverse solution for the elastic field in an isotropically growing spheroidal inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix, both made of the same incompressible neo-Hookean material. We also investigate the behavior of such an inclusion as it grows infinitely large, demonstrating the existence of a non-spherical asymptotic shape and an associated asymptotic pressure. We call this the isomorphic limit, and the associated pressure the isomorphic pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study generalizations of the inhomogeneous Burgers equation. First at the operator level, in the sense that we replace classical differential derivations by operators with certain properties, and then we increase the spatial dimensions of the Burgers equation, which is usually studied in one spatial dimension. This allows us, in one dimension, to find mathematical relationships between solutions of hyperbolic Brownian motion and the Burgers equations, which usually study the behaviour of mechanical fluids, and also, through appropriate transformations, to obtain in some cases exact solutions that depend on Hermite polynomials composed of appropriate functions. In the multi-dimensional case, this generalization allows us, by means of the method of invariant spaces, to find exact solutions on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian varieties, such as Schwarzschild and Ricci Solitons space, with time dictated by fractional derivatives, such as a Caputo-type operator of fractional evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of 1D bosons with density $\rho$, interacting through a general, repulsive 2-body potential with scattering length $a$, in the dilute limit $\rho |a|\ll1$. The first terms in the expansion of the thermodynamic energy density are $\pi^2\rho^3/3(1+2\rho a)$, where the leading order is the 1D free Fermi gas. This result covers the Tonks-Girardeau limit of the Lieb-Liniger model as a special case, but given the possibility that $a&gt;0$, it also applies to potentials that differ significantly from a delta function. We include extensions to spinless fermions and 1D anyonic symmetries, and discuss an application to confined 3D gases.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of atomic structure in a Thomas-Fermi mean-field model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Thomas-Fermi mean-field model for large neutral atoms. That is, Schr\"odinger operators $H_Z^{\text{TF}}=-\Delta-\Phi_Z^{\text{TF}}$ in three-dimensional space, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge of the atom and $\Phi_Z^{\text{TF}}$ is a mean-field potential coming from the Thomas-Fermi density functional theory for atoms. For any sequence $Z_n\to\infty$ we prove that the corresponding sequence $H_{Z_n}^{\text{TF}}$ is convergent in the strong resolvent sense if and only if $D_{\text{cl}}Z_n^{1/3}$ is convergent modulo $1$ for a universal constant $D_{\text{cl}}$. This can be interpreted in terms of periodicity of large atoms. We also characterize the possible limiting operators (infinite atoms) as a periodic one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions of $-\Delta-C_\infty\vert\,x\,\vert^{-4}$ for an explicit number $C_\infty$.</description>

Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <title>Explicit large $N$ von Neumann algebras from matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a large family of quantum mechanical systems that give rise to an emergent type III$_1$ von Neumann algebra in the large $N$ limit. Their partition functions are matrix integrals that appear in the study of various gauge theories. We calculate the real-time, finite temperature correlation functions in these systems and show that they are described by an emergent type III$_1$ von Neumann algebra at large $N$. The spectral density underlying this algebra is computed in closed form in terms of the eigenvalue density of a discrete matrix model. Furthermore, we explain how to systematically promote these theories to systems with a Hagedorn transition, and show that a type III$_1$ algebra only emerges above the Hagedorn temperature. Finally, we empirically observe in examples a correspondence between the space of states of the quantum mechanics and Calabi--Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, evolution of the space-time with the naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity provide accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels</description>

      <title>Anomalies in mirror symmetry enriched topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. In the Appendix we briefly recall our results concerning estimates of the overlap for general fermionic Gaussian states of CAR. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we present a far generalization of the following very well-known assertion: assume that we have two orthonormal sequences in a Hilbert space and these sequences are quadratically close to each other. Then if one of these sequences is a basis in the Hilbert space then so is the other one.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>
