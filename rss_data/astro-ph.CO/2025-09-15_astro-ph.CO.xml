      <title>The invariance of group occupation across the cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the Universe is the basis of modern cosmology. This chapter outlines the theory behind the expansion of the universe, including the cosmological principle, distances, velocities, and accelerations. We provide basic derivations of the key equations and highlight some interesting features, such as superluminal expansion, how pressure increases gravitational attraction, the subtleties of conservation of energy in the expanding universe, and the existence of cosmological horizons.</description>

      <title>The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=66.0\pm{4.3}\Mpc$ after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.</description>

      <title>Reionization in HESTIA: Studying reionization in the LG through zoom simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signature of X-ray heated halos around galaxies during cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Quantized Spatial Curvature $\Omega_K$ in globally CPT-symmetric universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic solution of the Friedmann equation in conformal time, implies that only cosmological perturbations exhibiting corresponding symmetries are physically permissible, leading to a discrete spectrum of allowed wave vectors. Furthermore, in a spatially closed universe, these wave vectors are independently constrained to be integers. Matching these two distinct quantization conditions provides a novel theoretical constraint on the possible values of spatial curvature. In this work, we numerically solve the cosmological perturbation equations, incorporating radiation anisotropy and higher-order Boltzmann terms, to calculate these discrete wave vectors with improved precision. Subsequently, we generate Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra for different characteristic spacings of these quantized wave vectors. Finally, we apply the constraint to Planck 2018 observational data to determine the cosmological parameters. This analysis yields a discrete set of allowed values for the spatial curvature, $\Omega_K$, including $[-0.076,-0.039, -0.024, -0.016, -0.012, \dots]$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe: Investigation of the Critical nature of the Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case. Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical simulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we analyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the black hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical -- critical exponents, differing by about $2\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist. Our findings provide direct numerical evidence for the near universality of the critical exponent in PBH formation, with only mild dependence on whether the collapse is driven by a scalar field or a perfect fluid.</description>

      <title>Joint X-ray, kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and weak lensing measurements: toward a consensus picture of efficient gas expulsion from groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no consensus on how baryon feedback shapes the underlying matter distribution from either simulations or observations. We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0&lt;z&lt;1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $&gt;8 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dynamical Systems Toolkit: Coupled Fields in Multiscalar Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an explicit supergravity realisation.</description>

      <title>Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5 in overdensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z&gt;5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Primordial Black Holes through Non-cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the matter power spectrum constraint on primordial black holes (PBH) by the dark matter (DM) emitted through Hawking radiation. We particularly focus on the scenario where PBH, with mass ranges between 1g and $10^9$g, evaporates before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Addition to that, we consider the case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination taking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is produced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold dark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples later on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts solely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium ever established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis is that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the mass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a protracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH evaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic and smooth out the small scale structure at much later time. By the precision measurement on the matter power spectrum from cosmic surveys, we are able to set joint constraint on light PBHs and the non-cold DMs it produced.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>The Last Stand Before Rubin: a consolidated sample of strong lensing systems in wide-field surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the "Last Stand Before Rubin" (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signature and the Nature of Neutrino Masses: Majorana, Dirac, or Pseudo-Dirac?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermionic nature of neutrinos and the origin of their tiny masses remain unresolved issues in particle physics, intrinsically connected to lepton number symmetry-conserved for Dirac, violated for Majorana, and effectively pseudo-Dirac when global symmetries invoked for conservation are broken by quantum gravity. We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.</description>

      <title>Removal of interloper contamination to line-intensity maps using correlations with ancillary tracers of the large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers an approach to obtain three-dimensional maps of the large-scale structure by collecting the aggregate emission from all emitters along the line of sight. The procedure hinges on reconstructing the radial positions of sources by relating the observed frequency to the rest-frame frequency of a target emission line. However, this step is hindered by `interloper-line' emission from different cosmological volumes that redshifts into the same observed frequency. In this work, we propose a model-independent technique to remove the contamination of line interlopers using their statistical correlation with external tracers of the large-scale structure, and identify the weights that minimize the variance of the cleaned field. Furthermore, we derive expressions for the resulting power spectra after applying our cleaning procedure, and validate them against simulations. We find that the cleaning performance improves as the correlation between the line interlopers and the external tracer increases, resulting in a gain in the signal-to-noise ratio of up to a factor 6 (2) for the auto- (cross-)power spectrum in idealized scenarios. This approach has the advantage of being model-independent, and is highly complementary to other techniques, as it removes large-scale clustering modes instead of individually masking the brightest sources of contamination.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>The Power of the Cosmic Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological information contained in the cosmic web, categorized as four structure types: nodes, filaments, walls, and voids, using the Quijote simulations and a modified nexus+ algorithm. We show that splitting the density field by the four structure types and combining the power spectrum in each provides much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters than using the power spectrum without splitting. We show the rich information contained in the cosmic web structures -- related to the Hessian of the density field -- for measuring all of the cosmological parameters, and in particular for constraining neutrino mass. We study the constraints as a function of Fourier scale, configuration space smoothing scale, and the underlying field. For the matter field with $k_{\rm max}=0.5\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find a factor of $\times20$ tighter constraints on neutrino mass when using smoothing scales larger than 12.5~Mpc/$h$, and $\times80$ tighter when using smoothing scales down to 1.95~Mpc/$h$. However, for the CDM+Baryon field we observe a more modest $\times1.7$ or $\times3.6$ improvement, for large and small smoothing scales respectively. We release our new python package for identifying cosmic structures pycosmmommf at https://github.com/James11222/pycosmommf to enable future studies of the cosmological information of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Separating Angular and Radial Modes with Spherical-Fourier Bessel Power Spectrum on All Scales and Implications for Systematics Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. While the parallel and perpendicular Fourier mode $(k_{||}, k_\perp)$ decomposition underlying the wedge is only valid for surveys of small angular coverage with a well-defined global line-of-sight, the SFB basis provides a natural generalization that can be applied to the full sky. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses of wide-field surveys based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate~$f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss of constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to $80\%$ in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer the reheat temperature ($T_{\rm RH}$) of the Universe from the collider signal of freezing in dark matter (DM). We demonstrate it for the mono-$\gamma$ signal at the electron-positron colliders, which indicates to a low-scale $T_{\rm RH}$, after addressing observed DM abundance, BBN, and other relevant constraints. The method can be used to correlate different reheating dynamics, DM models, and collider signals.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</description>
