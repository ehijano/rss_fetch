      <title>Probabilistic Verification for Modular Network-on-Chip Systems (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative verification can provide deep insights into reliable Network-On-Chip (NoC) designs. It is critical to understanding and mitigating operational issues caused by power supply noise (PSN) early in the design process: fluctuations in network traffic in modern NoC designs cause dramatic variations in power delivery across the network, leading to unreliability and errors in data transfers. Further complicating these challenges, NoC designs vary widely in size, usage, and implementation. This case study paper presents a principled, systematic, and modular NoC modeling approach using the Modest language that closely reflects the standard hierarchical design approach in digital systems. Using the Modest Toolset, functional and quantitative correctness was established for several NoC models, all of which were instantiated from a generic modular router model. Specifically, this work verifies the functional correctness of a generic router, inter-router communication, and the entire NoC. Statistical model checking was used to verify PSN-related properties for NoCs of size up to 8x8.</description>

      <title>Context-aware, Ante-hoc Explanations of Driving Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be both safe and trustworthy to gain social acceptance and become a viable option for everyday public transportation. Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations. Our method is demonstrated in a simulated overtaking.</description>

      <title>Abstract Scene Graphs: Formalizing and Monitoring Spatial Properties of Automated Driving Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Driving Functions (ADFs) need to comply with spatial properties of varied complexity while driving on public roads. Since such situations are safety-critical in nature, it is necessary to continuously check ADFs for compliance with their spatial properties. Due to their complexity, such spatial properties need to be formalized to enable their automated checking. Scene Graphs (SGs) allow for an explicit structured representation of objects present in a traffic scene and their spatial relationships to each other. In this paper, we build upon the SG construct and propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) formalism to formalize spatial properties of ADFs. We show using real-world examples how spatial properties can be formalized using ASGs. Finally, we present a framework that uses ASGs to perform Runtime Monitoring of ADFs. To this end, we also show algorithmically how a spatial property formalized as an ASG can be satisfied by ADF system behaviour. </description>

      <title>Safe-ROS: An Architecture for Autonomous Robots in Safety-Critical Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains requires architectures that ensure operational effectiveness and safety compliance. In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the  Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Many Simulations of Hybrid Programs in Lince</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems are increasingly used in critical applications such as medical devices, infrastructure systems, and autonomous vehicles. Lince is an academic tool for specifying and simulating such systems using a C-like language with differential equations. This paper presents recent experiments that enhance Lince with mechanisms for executing multiple simulation variants and generating histograms that quantify the frequency with which a given property holds. We illustrate our extended Lince using variations of an adaptive cruise control system.</description>

      <title>Towards A Catalogue of Requirement Patterns for Space Robotic Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.</description>

      <title>Redundancy rules for MaxSAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of redundancy in SAT leads to more expressive and powerful proof search techniques, e.g., able to express various inprocessing techniques, and originates interesting hierarchies of proof systems [Heule et.al'20, Buss-Thapen'19]. Redundancy has also been integrated in MaxSAT [Ihalainen et.al'22, Berg et.al'23, Bonacina et.al'24].
  In this paper, we define a structured hierarchy of redundancy proof systems for MaxSAT, with the goal of studying its proof complexity. We obtain MaxSAT variants of proof systems such as SPR, PR, SR, and others, previously defined for SAT.
  All our rules are polynomially checkable, unlike [Ihalainen et.al'22]. Moreover, they are simpler and weaker than [Berg et.al'23], and possibly amenable to lower bounds.
  This work also complements the approach of [Bonacina et.al'24]. Their proof systems use different rule sets for soft and hard clauses, while here we propose a system using only hard clauses and blocking variables. This is easier to integrate with current solvers and proof checkers.
  We discuss the strength of the systems introduced, we show some limitations of them, and we give a short cost-SR proof that any assignment for the weak pigeonhole principle $PHP^{m}_{n}$ falsifies at least $m-n$ clauses.
  We conclude by discussing the integration of our rules with the MaxSAT resolution proof system, which is a commonly studied proof system for MaxSAT.</description>

      <title>Achieving Safe Control Online through Integration of Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions with Unsafe Object-Centric Action Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.</description>

      <title>Watchdogs and Oracles: Runtime Verification Meets Large Language Models for Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.</description>

      <title>The Solver's Paradox in Formal Problem Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how global decision problems over arithmetically represented domains acquire reflective structure through class-quantification. Arithmetization forces diagonal fixed points whose verification requires reflection beyond finitary means, producing Feferman-style obstructions independent of computational technique. We use this mechanism to analyze uniform complexity statements, including $\mathsf{P}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$, showing that their difficulty stems from structural impredicativity rather than methodological limitations. The focus is not on deriving separations but on clarifying the logical status of such arithmetized assertions.</description>

      <title>Localized RETE for Incremental Graph Queries with Nested Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13918v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing size of graph-based modeling artifacts in model-driven engineering calls for techniques that enable efficient execution of graph queries. Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead.
  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph.
  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and with queries and data from an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable overhead in unfavorable cases.</description>

      <title>A general approach to asymptotic elimination of aggregation functions and generalized quantifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a logic with truth values in the unit interval and which uses aggregation functions instead of quantifiers, and we describe a general approach to asymptotic elimination of aggregation functions and, indirectly, of asymptotic elimination of Mostowski style generalized quantifiers, since such can be expressed by using aggregation functions. The notion of ``local continuity'' of an aggregation function, which we make precise in two (related) ways, plays a central role in this approach.</description>

      <title>Structuring Definitions in Mathematical Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Codifying mathematical theories in a proof assistant or computer algebra system is a challenging task, of which the most difficult part is, counterintuitively, structuring definitions. This results in a steep learning curve for new users and slow progress in formalizing even undergraduate level mathematics. There are many considerations one has to make, such as level of generality, readability, and ease of use in the type system, and there are typically multiple equivalent or related definitions from which to choose. Often, a definition that is ultimately selected for formalization is settled on after a lengthy trial and error process. This process involves testing potential definitions for usability by formalizing standard theorems about them, and weeding out the definitions that are unwieldy.
  Inclusion of a formal definition in a centralized community-run mathematical library is typically an indication that the definition is "good." For this reason, in this survey, we make some observations about what makes a definition "good," and examine several case studies of the refining process for definitions that have ultimately been added to the Lean Theorem Prover community-run mathematical library, mathlib. We observe that some of the difficulties are shared with the design of libraries for computer algebra systems, and give examples of related issues in that context.</description>
