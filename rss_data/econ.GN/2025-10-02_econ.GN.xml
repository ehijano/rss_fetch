      <title>Two-Stage Asymmetric Tullock Contests with Cost Shifters and Endogenous Continuation Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a contest-theoretic simplified model of triathlon as a sequential two-stage game. In Stage 1 (post-swim), participants decide whether to continue or withdraw from the contest, thereby generating an endogenous participation decision. In Stage 2 (bike-run), competition is represented as a Tullock contest in which swim drafting acts as a multiplicative shifter of quadratic effort costs. Closed-form equilibrium strategies are derived in the two-player case, and existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics are shown in the asymmetric n-player case. The continuation decision yields athlete-specific cutoff rules in swim drafting intensity and induces subgame-perfect equilibria (SPEs) with endogenous participation sets. The analysis relates swim drafting benefits, exposure, and group size to heterogeneous effective cost parameters and equilibrium efforts.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Spatial and Temporal Treatment Effect Boundaries: Theory and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for detecting and estimating boundaries in treatment effects across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We formalize the concept of treatment effect boundaries as structural parameters characterizing regime transitions where causal effects cease to operate. Building on diffusion-based models of information propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal boundaries share common dynamics, derive identification results, and propose consistent estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance of our methods under various data-generating processes. The framework provides tools for detecting when local treatments become systemic and identifying critical thresholds for policy intervention.</description>

      <title>The Benefits from Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new market design for K-12 school broadband procurement that switched from school-specific bidding to a system that bundled schools into groups. Using an event study approach, we estimate that the program reduced internet prices by \$9.17 (55\%) per Mbps per month while increasing bandwidth by 380.06 Mbps (136\%). These benefits resulted primarily from mitigating exposure risk in broadband procurement - the risk that providers win too few contracts to cover their fixed infrastructure costs. Using a bounds approach, we show robustness of our estimates and document that participants saved between \$1.61 million and \$3.48 million, while their existing federal E-rate subsidy was \$2.47 million, and experienced substantial welfare gains.</description>

      <title>TaxSolver: A methodology to realize optimal income tax reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across the globe there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limited fluctuations in taxpayer incomes or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.</description>
