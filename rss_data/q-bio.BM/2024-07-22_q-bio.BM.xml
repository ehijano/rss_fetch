      <title>Leveraging Latent Evolutionary Optimization for Targeted Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead optimization is a pivotal task in the drug design phase within the drug discovery lifecycle. The primary objective is to refine the lead compound to meet specific molecular properties for progression to the subsequent phase of development. In this work, we present an innovative approach, Latent Evolutionary Optimization for Molecule Generation (LEOMol), a generative modeling framework for the efficient generation of optimized molecules. LEOMol leverages Evolutionary Algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution, to search the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). This search facilitates the identification of the target molecule distribution within the latent space. Our approach consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art models across a range of constrained molecule generation tasks, outperforming existing models in all four sub-tasks related to property targeting. Additionally, we suggest the importance of including toxicity in the evaluation of generative models. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the improvements that our approach provides over gradient-based latent space optimization methods. This underscores the effectiveness and superiority of LEOMol in addressing the inherent challenges in constrained molecule generation while emphasizing its potential to propel advancements in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Small Molecules with Latent Space RL Fine-Tuning to Protein Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A specific challenge with deep learning approaches for molecule generation is generating both syntactically valid and chemically plausible molecular string representations. To address this, we propose a novel generative latent-variable transformer model for small molecules that leverages a recently proposed molecular string representation called SAFE. We introduce a modification to SAFE to reduce the number of invalid fragmented molecules generated during training and use this to train our model. Our experiments show that our model can generate novel molecules with a validity rate &gt; 90% and a fragmentation rate &lt; 1% by sampling from a latent space. By fine-tuning the model using reinforcement learning to improve molecular docking, we significantly increase the number of hit candidates for five specific protein targets compared to the pre-trained model, nearly doubling this number for certain targets. Additionally, our top 5% mean docking scores are comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA), and we marginally outperform SOTA on three of the five targets.</description>

      <title>Decomposed Direct Preference Optimization for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved promising results for Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). Nevertheless, high-quality protein subpocket and ligand data are relatively scarce, which hinders the models' generation capabilities. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a pivotal tool for the alignment of generative models such as large language models and diffusion models, providing greater flexibility and accuracy by directly aligning model outputs with human preferences. Building on this advancement, we introduce DPO to SBDD in this paper. We tailor diffusion models to pharmaceutical needs by aligning them with elaborately designed chemical score functions. We propose a new structure-based molecular optimization method called DecompDPO, which decomposes the molecule into arms and scaffolds and performs preference optimization at both local substructure and global molecule levels, allowing for more precise control with fine-grained preferences. Notably, DecompDPO can be effectively used for two main purposes: (1) fine-tuning pretrained diffusion models for molecule generation across various protein families, and (2) molecular optimization given a specific protein subpocket after generation. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that DecompDPO significantly improves model performance in both molecule generation and optimization, with up to 100% Median High Affinity and a 54.9% Success Rate.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>

      <title>T- Hop: A framework for studying the importance path information in molecular graphs for chemical property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the usefulness of incorporating path information in predicting chemical properties from molecular graphs, in the domain of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship). Towards this, we developed a GNN-style model which can be toggled to operate in one of two modes: a non-degenerate mode which incorporates path information, and a degenerate mode which leaves out path information. Thus, by comparing the performance of the non-degenerate mode versus the degenerate mode on relevant QSAR datasets, we were able to directly assess the significance of path information on those datasets. Our results corroborate previous works, by suggesting that the usefulness of path information is datasetdependent. Unlike previous studies however, we took the very first steps towards building a model that could predict upfront whether or not path information would be useful for a given dataset at hand. Moreover, we also found that, albeit its simplicity, the degenerate mode of our model yielded rather surprising results, which outperformed more sophisticated SOTA models in certain cases.</description>

      <title>AI-predicted protein deformation encodes energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI algorithms have proven to be excellent predictors of protein structure, but whether and how much these algorithms can capture the underlying physics remains an open question. Here, we aim to test this question using the Alphafold2 (AF) algorithm: We use AF to predict the subtle structural deformation induced by single mutations, quantified by strain, and compare with experimental datasets of corresponding perturbations in folding free energy $\Delta\Delta G$. Unexpectedly, we find that physical strain alone -- without any additional data or computation -- correlates almost as well with $\Delta\Delta G$ as state-of-the-art energy-based and machine-learning predictors. This indicates that the AF-predicted structures alone encode fine details about the energy landscape. In particular, the structures encode significant information on stability, enough to estimate (de-)stabilizing effects of mutations, thus paving the way for the development of novel, structure-based stability predictors for protein design and evolution.</description>

      <title>Learning Collective Variables with Synthetic Data Augmentation through Physics-Inspired Geodesic Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, are typically studied using enhanced sampling techniques, most of which are based on the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which acceleration occurs. Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lack of information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfolded to folded conformation. We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategy using physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resembling protein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without true transition state samples. This new data can be used to improve the accuracy of classifier-based methods. Alternatively, a regression-based learning scheme for CV models can be adopted by leveraging the interpolation progress parameter.</description>

      <title>Bacterial stress granule protects mRNA through ribonucleases exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in mRNA storage, enabling organisms to swiftly respond to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying mRNA integration and protection within droplets remain unclear. Here, we unravel the role of bacterial aggresomes as stress granules (SGs) in safeguarding mRNA during stress. We discovered that upon stress onset, mobile mRNA molecules selectively incorporate into individual proteinaceous SGs based on length-dependent enthalpic gain over entropic loss. As stress prolongs, SGs undergo compaction facilitated by stronger non-specific RNA-protein interactions, thereby promoting recruitment of shorter RNA chains. Remarkably, mRNA ribonucleases are repelled from bacterial SGs, due to the influence of protein surface charge. This exclusion mechanism ensures the integrity and preservation of mRNA within SGs during stress conditions, explaining how mRNA can be stored and protected from degradation. Following stress removal, SGs facilitate mRNA translation, thereby enhancing cell fitness in changing environments. These droplets maintain mRNA physiological activity during storage, making them an intriguing new candidate for mRNA therapeutics manufacturing.</description>
