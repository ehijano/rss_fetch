      <title>Global existence of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in $L^3$ with small data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the global-in-time existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for the stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a multiplicative noise on the three-dimensional torus. Under natural smallness conditions on the noise, we prove the almost global existence result for small $L^{3}$ data. Namely, we show that for data sufficiently small, there exists a global-in-time strong $L^{3}$ solution in a space of probability arbitrarily close to~$1$.</description>

      <title>On the analytic extension of Random Riemann Zeta Functions for some probabilistic models of the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first step in the formulation and study of the Riemann Hypothesis is the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) in the full Complex Plane with a pole at $s=1$. In the current work, we study the analytic continuation of two random versions of RZF using, for $Re s&gt;1$, the Euler representation of ZF in terms of the product of functions over primes. In the first case, we substitute in the Euler product pseudo-prime numbers from the famous Cram\'er Model. In the second case, we use pseudo-primes with local symmetries. We show that in the Cram\'er case analytic continuation is possible $\mathbb{P}$-a.s. for $Res&gt;1/2$, but not through the critical line $Re s=1/2.$ In the second case, we show that the analytic continuation is possible in a larger domain. We also study for the Cram\'er pseudo-primes several problems from Additive Number Theory.</description>

      <title>Stable processes with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Hunt process that can be described as an isotropic $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process reflected from the complement of a bounded open Lipschitz set. In fact, we introduce a new analytic method for concatenating Markov processes. It is based on nonlocal Schr\"odinger perturbations of sub-Markovian transition kernels and the construction of two supermedian functions with different growth rates at infinity. We apply this framework to describe the return distribution and the stationary distribution of the process. To handle the strong Markov property at the reflection time, we introduce a novel ladder process, whose transition semigroup encodes not only the position of the process, but also the number of reflections.</description>

      <title>Estimate of Koopman modes and eigenvalues with Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method of extracting spatial-temporal coherent modes from complex systems and providing an equation-free architecture to model and predict systems. However, in practical applications, the accuracy of DMD can be limited in extracting dynamical features due to sensor noise in measurements. We develop an adaptive method to constantly update dynamic modes and eigenvalues from noisy measurements arising from discrete systems. Our method is based on the Ensemble Kalman filter owing to its capability of handling time-varying systems and nonlinear observables. Our method can be extended to non-autonomous dynamical systems, accurately recovering short-time eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs and observables. Theoretical analysis shows that the estimation is accurate in long term data misfit. We demonstrate the method on both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems to show its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $N$-player games, in continuous time, finite state space and finite time horizon, on a geometrical structure possessing a macroscopic limit in a suitable sense. This geometrical structure breaks the permutation invariance property that gives rise to mean field games. The corresponding limit game is a variant of mean field games that we call {\em long range game}. We prove that this asymptotic scheme satisfies the following key properties: a) the long range game admits al least one equilibrium; b) this equilibrium is unique under a suitable monotonicity condition; c) the feedback corresponding to any equilibrium of the long range game is a quasi-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player games. We finally show that this scheme includes several examples of interaction mechanisms, in particular Kac-type interactions and interactions on generalized Erd\"{o}s-Renyi graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using a formulation of a class of compressible viscous flows with a heat source via vorticity and expansion-rate, we study the Oberbeck-Boussinesq flows. To this end we establish a new integral representation for solutions of parabolic equations subject to certain boundary condition, which allows us to develop a random vortex method for certain compressible flows and to compute numerically solutions of their dynamical models. Numerical experiments are carried out, which not only capture detailed B\'enard convection but also are capable of providing additional information on the fluid density and the dynamics of expansion-rate of the flow.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers an ergodic version of the bounded velocity follower problem, assuming that the decision maker lacks knowledge of the underlying system parameters and must learn them while simultaneously controlling. We propose algorithms based on moving empirical averages and develop a framework for integrating statistical methods with stochastic control theory. Our primary result is a logarithmic expected regret rate. To achieve this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the ergodic convergence rates of the underlying processes and the risks of the considered estimators.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for $\epsilon$-Contaminated Credal Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a version for lower probabilities of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Neural Sampling from Boltzmann Densities: Fisher-Rao Curves in the Wasserstein Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with the task of sampling from an unnormalized Boltzmann density $\rho_D$ by learning a Boltzmann curve given by energies $f_t$ starting in a simple density $\rho_Z$. First, we examine conditions under which Fisher-Rao flows are absolutely continuous in the Wasserstein geometry. Second, we address specific interpolations $f_t$ and the learning of the related density/velocity pairs $(\rho_t,v_t)$. It was numerically observed that the linear interpolation, which requires only a parametrization of the velocity field $v_t$, suffers from a "teleportation-of-mass" issue. Using tools from the Wasserstein geometry, we give an analytical example, where we can precisely measure the explosion of the velocity field. Inspired by M\'at\'e and Fleuret, who parametrize both $f_t$ and $v_t$, we propose an interpolation which parametrizes only $f_t$ and fixes an appropriate $v_t$. This corresponds to the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence related to Langevin dynamics. We demonstrate by numerical examples that our model provides a well-behaved flow field which successfully solves the above sampling task.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport: Bounds on concentration and bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT) problem for quadratic cost and compactly supported marginals $\mu$ and $\nu$. It has been empirically observed that the optimal coupling $\pi_\epsilon$ for the QOT problem has sparse support for small regularization parameter $\epsilon&gt;0.$ In this article we provide the first quantitative description of this phenomenon in general dimension: we derive bounds on the size and on the location of the support of $\pi_\epsilon$ compared to the Monge coupling. Our analysis is based on pointwise bounds on the density of $\pi_\epsilon$ together with Minty's trick, which provides a quadratic detachment from the optimal transport duality gap. In the self-transport setting $\mu=\nu$ we obtain optimal rates of order $\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2+d}}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expected transition frequency between the two metastable states of a stochastic wave equation with double-well potential. By transition state theory, the frequency factorizes into two components: one depends only on the invariant measure, given by the $\phi^4_d$ quantum field theory, and the other takes the dynamics into account. We compute the first component with the variational approach to stochastic quantization when $d = 2, 3$. For the two-dimensional equation with random data but no stochastic forcing, we also compute the transmission coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution functions of several classical error terms in analytic number theory, focusing on the remainder term in the Dirichlet divisor problem $\Delta(x)$. We first bound the discrepancy between the distribution function of $\Delta(x)$ and that of a corresponding probabilistic random model, improving results of Heath-Brown and Lau. We then determine the shape of its large deviations in a certain uniform range, which we believe to be the limit of our method, given our current knowledge about the linear relations among the $\sqrt{n}$ for square-free positive integers $n$. Finally, we obtain similar results for the error terms in the Gauss circle problem and in the second moment of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 4D fixed length lattice Higgs model with Wilson action for the gauge field and structure group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We study Wilson line observables in the strong coupling regime and compute their asymptotic behavior with error estimates. Our analysis is based on a high-temperature representation of the lattice Higgs measure combined with Poisson approximation. We also give a short proof of the folklore result that Wilson line (and loop) expectations exhibit perimeter law decay whenever the Higgs field coupling constant is positive.</description>

      <title>Unadjusted Hamiltonian MCMC with Stratified Monte Carlo Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A randomized time integrator is suggested for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) which involves a very minor modification to the usual Verlet time integrator, and hence, is easy to implement. For target distributions of the form $\mu(dx) \propto e^{-U(x)} dx$ where $U: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is $K$-strongly convex but only $L$-gradient Lipschitz, and initial distributions $\nu$ with finite second moment, coupling proofs reveal that an $\varepsilon$-accurate approximation of the target distribution in $L^2$-Wasserstein distance $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}^2$ can be achieved by the uHMC algorithm with randomized time integration using $O\left((d/K)^{1/3} (L/K)^{5/3} \varepsilon^{-2/3} \log( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}^2(\mu, \nu) / \varepsilon)^+\right)$ gradient evaluations; whereas for such rough target densities the corresponding complexity of the uHMC algorithm with Verlet time integration is in general $O\left((d/K)^{1/2} (L/K)^2 \varepsilon^{-1} \log( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}^2(\mu, \nu) / \varepsilon)^+ \right)$. Metropolis-adjustable randomized time integrators are also provided.</description>

      <title>Chaos, concentration and multiple valleys in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A decade and a half ago Chatterjee established the first rigorous connection between anomalous fluctuations and a chaotic behaviour of the ground state in certain Gaussian disordered systems. The purpose of this paper is to show that Chatterjee's work gives evidence of a more general principle, by establishing an analogous connection between fluctuations and chaos in the context of first-passage percolation. The notion of `chaos' here refers to the sensitivity of the time-minimising path between two points when exposed to a slight perturbation. More precisely, we resample a small proportion of the edge weights, and find that a vanishing fraction of the edges on the time-minimising path still belongs to the time-minimising path obtained after resampling. We also identify the point at which the system transitions from being stable to being chaotic in terms of the variance of the system. Finally we show that the chaotic behaviour implies the existence of a large number of almost-optimal paths that are almost disjoint from the time-minimising path, a phenomenon known as 'multiple valleys'.</description>

      <title>Maxima over random time intervals for heavy-tailed compound renewal and L\'evy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive subexponential tail asymptotics for the distribution of the maximum of a compound renewal process with linear component and of a L\'evy process, both with negative drift, over random time horizon $\tau$ that does not depend on the future increments of the process. Our asymptotic results are uniform over the whole class of such random times. Particular examples are given by stopping times and by $\tau$ independent of the processes. We link our results with random walk theory.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Lenstra distribution for sparse matrices with determinantal biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us consider the following matrix $B_n$. The columns of $B_n$ are indexed with $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ and the rows are indexed with $[n]^3$. The row corresponding to $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in [n]^3$ is given by $\sum_{i=1}^3 e_{x_i}$, where $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{[n]}$. Let $A_n$ be random $n\times n$ submatrix of $B_n$, where the probability that we choose a submatrix $C$ is proportional to $|\det(C)|^2$.
  Let $p\ge 5$ be a prime. We prove that the asymptotic distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ is given by the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics.
  Our result is motivated by the conjecture that the first homology group of a random two dimensional hypertree is also Cohen-Lenstra distributed.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on Malliavin calculus in regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malliavin calculus provides a characterization of the centered model in regularity structures that is stable under removing the small-scale cut-off. In conjunction with a spectral gap inequality, it yields the stochastic estimates of the model.
  This becomes transparent on the level of a notion of model that parameterizes the solution manifold, and thus is indexed by multi-indices rather than trees, and which allows for a more geometric than combinatorial perspective. In these lecture notes, this is carried out for a PDE with heat operator, a cubic nonlinearity, and driven by additive noise, reminiscent of the stochastic quantization of the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model.
  More precisely, we informally motivate our notion of the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ as charts and transition maps, respectively, of the nonlinear solution manifold. These geometric objects are algebrized in terms of formal power series, and their algebra automorphisms. We will assimilate the directional Malliavin derivative to a tangent vector of the solution manifold. This means that it can be treated as a modelled distribution, thereby connecting stochastic model estimates to pathwise solution theory, with its analytic tools of reconstruction and integration. We unroll an inductive calculus that in an automated way applies to the full subcritical regime.</description>

      <title>Cutoff phenomenon in nonlinear recombinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quadratic dynamical system known as nonlinear recombinations. This system models the evolution of a probability measure over the Boolean cube, converging to the stationary state obtained as the product of the initial marginals. Our main result reveals a cutoff phenomenon for the total variation distance in both discrete and continuous time. Additionally, we derive the explicit cutoff profiles in the case of monochromatic initial distributions. These profiles are different in the discrete and continuous time settings. The proof leverages a pathwise representation of the solution in terms of a fragmentation process associated to a binary tree. In continuous time, the underlying binary tree is given by a branching random process, thus requiring a more elaborate probabilistic analysis.</description>

      <title>From Letters to Words and Back: Invertible Coding of Stationary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems of statistical language modeling, we consider probability measures on infinite sequences over two countable alphabets of a different cardinality, such as letters and words. We introduce an invertible mapping between such measures, called the normalized transport, that preserves both stationarity and ergodicity. The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes and specialize bijective stationary codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport and self-avoiding codes arise, for instance, in the problem of successive recurrence times. In particular, we show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which strengthens a result by Chen Moy from 1959.</description>

      <title>The KPZ Fixed Point and the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term 'KPZ' stands for the initials of three physicists, namely Kardar, Parisi and Zhang, which, in 1986 conjectured the existence of universal scaling behaviours for many random growth processes in the plane. A process is said to belong to the KPZ universality class if one can associate to it an appropriate 'height function' and show that its 3:2:1 (time : space: fluctuation) scaling limit, see 1.2, converges to a universal random process, the KPZ fixed point. Alternatively, membership is loosely characterised by having: 1. Local dynamics; 2. A smoothing mechanism; 3. Slope-dependent growth rate (lateral growth); 4. Space-time random forcing with the rapid decay of correlations.
  The central object that we will study is the so-called KPZ fixed point, which belongs to the KPZ universality class. Many strides have been made in the last couple of decades in this field, with constructions of the KPZ fixed point from certain processes such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (with arbitrary initial condition) and Brownian last passage percolation.
  In this article, we: 1. delineate the origins of KPZ universality; 2. describe and motivate canonical models; 3. give an overview of recent developments, especially those in the 2018 Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virag (DOV) paper; 4. present the strategy of and key points in the proof of the absolute continuity result of the KPZ fixed point by Sarkar and Virag; 5. conclude with remarks for future directions. The presentation is such that the content is displayed in a way that is as self-contained as possible and aimed at a motivated audience that has mastered the fundamentals of the theory of probability.</description>

      <title>Two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk (SAW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq5$ and use it to prove pattern theorems for the self-avoiding walk. We show that infinite two-sided SAW is the infinite-shift limit of infinite one-sided SAW and the infinite-size limit of finite two-sided SAW. We then prove that for every pattern $\zeta$, the fraction of times $\zeta$ occurs in the SAW converges to the probability that the two-sided infinite SAW starts with $\zeta$. The convergence is in probability for the finite SAW and almost surely for the infinite SAW. Along the way, we show that infinite SAW is ergodic using a coupling technique. At the end of the paper, we pose a conjecture regarding the existence of infinite SAW in low dimensions. We show that this conjecture is true in high dimensions, thus giving a new proof for the existence of infinite SAW for $d\geq5$. The proofs in this paper rely only on the asymptotics for the number of self-avoiding paths and the SAW two-point function. Although these results were shown by Hara and Slade using the lace expansion, the proofs in this paper do not use the lace expansion and might be adapted to prove existence and ergodicity of other infinite high-dimensional lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the relevant combinatorics pertaining to cyclic-conditional freeness in order to introduce the adequate sets of cumulants linearizing the cyclic-conditional additive convolution. On our way, we introduce a new non-commutative independence, cyclic freeness. We explain how cyclic-conditional freeness is "reduced" to cyclic freeness by utilizing a multivariate extension of the inverse Markov-Krein transform. We also consider cyclic-conditional multiplicative convolution and prove limit theorems.</description>

      <title>GROD: Enhancing Generalization of Transformer with Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer networks excel in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, they face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, that is, data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish data that deviates from the expected distribution, while maintaining optimal performance on in-distribution (ID) data. This paper introduces a novel approach based on OOD detection, termed the Generate Rounded OOD Data (GROD) algorithm, which significantly bolsters the generalization performance of transformer networks across various tasks. GROD is motivated by our new OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformer. The transformer has learnability in terms of OOD detection that is, when the data is sufficient the outlier can be well represented. By penalizing the misclassification of OOD data within the loss function and generating synthetic outliers, GROD guarantees learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inlier and outlier. This strategy demonstrates robust adaptability and general applicability across different data types. Evaluated across diverse OOD detection tasks in NLP and CV, GROD achieves SOTA regardless of data format. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GROD-OOD-Detection-with-transformers-B70F.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Least Squares, Orthogonal Projection, and QR Factorization Algorithms Subject to Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Liesen et al. (2002), which analyzes how the condition number of an orthonormal matrix Q changes when a column is added ([Q, c]), particularly focusing on the perpendicularity of c to the span of Q. Their result, presented in Theorem 2.3 of Liesen et al. (2002), assumes exact arithmetic and orthonormality of Q, which is a strong assumption when applying these results to numerical methods such as QR factorization algorithms. In our work, we address this gap by deriving bounds on the condition number increase for a matrix B without assuming perfect orthonormality, even when a column is not perfectly orthogonal to the span of B. This framework allows us to analyze QR factorization methods where orthogonalization is imperfect and subject to Gaussian noise. We also provide results on the performance of orthogonal projection and least squares under Gaussian noise, further supporting the development of this theory.</description>

      <title>CSIM: A Copula-based similarity index sensitive to local changes for Image quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image similarity metrics play an important role in computer vision applications, as they are used in image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare, astronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and FSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or sensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel image similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being sensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel metric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into vectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors contain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the dependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships within the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively models the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced comparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared to other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms existing similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including noise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle differences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high importance. The results obtained in this work can be reproduced from this Github repository: https://github.com/safouaneelg/copulasimilarity.</description>
