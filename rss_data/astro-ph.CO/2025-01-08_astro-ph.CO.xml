      <title>Bulk viscous matter in $f(T)$ gravity: A path to cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying bulk viscosity coefficients $\zeta(t)=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}H$ on cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We focus on two cases: (i) $\zeta_{1} \neq0$ and (ii) $\zeta_{1} =0$, deriving the Hubble parameter $H$ as a function of redshift $z$ using a linear $f(T)$ model ($f(T) = \alpha T$ where $\alpha \neq 0$). Using the combined $H(z)+Pantheon^{+}+BAO$ dataset, we obtain observational constraints on model parameters. For Case I ($\zeta_1 \neq 0$), best-fit values are $H_0=60.0^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=1.01^{+0.10}_{-0.098}$, $\zeta_0=40.1^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$, and $\zeta_1=0.123^{+0.093}_{-0.088}$, while for Case II ($\zeta_1 = 0$), they are $H_0=67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=0.94^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and $\zeta_0=34.7^{+2.0}_{-2.0}$. The analysis reveals a transition in the deceleration parameter, indicating a shift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe's expansion, with present-day values of $q_{0} \approx -0.49$ and $q_{0} \approx -0.32$ for the respective cases. The jerk parameter $j(z)$ and effective EoS for the cosmic viscous fluid also support the cosmic acceleration, with trajectories aligning with the quintessence scenario. These findings underscore the potential of our $f(T)$ model dominated by bulk viscous matter in explaining cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Model Against Gravity-Thermodynamics Conjecture: Observational Constraints After DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture based on the Tsallis entropy-area relation, we investigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and examine some potential deviations from it. Utilizing recent updates from geometrical datasets, including the DESI BAO measurements (2024), Planck CMB anisotropy measurements (2018), and the Pantheon+ catalogue for SNIa (2022), we conduct a thorough analysis via the window of Tsallis cosmology. In the first step, our analysis reveals no significant deviation from the standard model when using DESI BAO data alone, Pantheon+ data alone, or a combination of both. In the next step, we incorporate all datasets by adding the CMB data to our analysis, indicating a potential deviation from the standard model within the framework of Tsallis cosmology. Imposing the Planck prior to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, we observe support for the standard model and consistency between our constraints on the Hubble constant and the Planck value. Finally, we compare the Tsallis and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).</description>

      <title>A cosmic degeneracy story: structure formation with warm dark matter and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that cosmological models with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) could provide a possible path to solve current cosmic tensions. Moreover, it has been pointed out that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) for several observables at low redshift. Here, we confirm the qualitative similarity of the matter power spectrum for sPNG and WDM models, but also point out differences in the halo mass function and void size function. We then jointly simulate WDM and sPNG together. Such simulations allow us to demonstrate that the joint impact of WDM and sPNG is close to the linear superposition of their respective effects at low redshift, at the percent level. We finally propose a model with mixed hot and cold dark matter together with sPNG, that reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum at redshifts $z \leq 3$ but is still distinct in terms of halo statistics.</description>

      <title>Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy has become a topic of interest in cosmology. Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to {\Lambda}CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves of GUT Phase Transition during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GUT phase transition during inflation solves the GUT monopole problem on one hand. On the other hand, gravitational waves (GWs) from such a phase transition, if it is first-order, are redshifted and deformed, and might be observed today in GW observatories. We review the formalism of inflated GWs and derive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW spectra in the instant-source application. It is valid for any e-folding number of instant source. Applying the formalism to GUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift the GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the future ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the discussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale. It is worth mentioning that, due to the deformation of the spectrum, the peak of inflated GWs is not simply a redshift of the peak of uninflated GWs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation Theory with Trinity of Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explicitly develops the three-field cosmological perturbation theory with a flat field space. We solve the background and perturbation equations numerically for three different cases. First, to check the consistency of the three-field formalism, we investigate an effective two-field model motivated by the two-block case of the multi-giant vacua matrix Inflation model. Then we investigate a completely three-field case without any direct interaction between different fields, and finally, a three-field case containing direct interactions. The power spectra of the curvature perturbations in all cases are computed numerically, and the effects of rapid turn in the power spectrum are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The fragmentation of molecular clouds in starburst environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of star formation occurs and has occurred in environments unlike the solar neighbourhood. The majority of stars formed closer to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate (z &gt; 1.3) and a great deal of star formation presently occurs in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. These environments are unified by the presence of a high interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). Numerical studies of stellar birth typically neglect this fact, and those that do not have thus far been limited in scope. In this work we present the first comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation in extreme environments where we have increased the ISRF and CRIR to values typical of the CMZ and starburst galaxies. We note changes in the fragmentation behaviour on both the core and stellar system scale, leading to top-heavy core and stellar system mass functions in high ISRF/CRIR clouds. Clouds fragment less on the core scale, producing fewer but more massive cores. Conversely, the cores fragment more intensely and produce richer clusters of stellar systems. We present a picture where high ISRF/CRIR clouds fragment less on the scale of cores and clumps, but more on the scale of stellar systems. The change in fragmentation behaviour subsequently changes the mass function of the stellar systems that form through enhanced accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long lived particle searches in laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination. If such a period of matter domination was catalysed by metastable, long-lived particles, then there will be complementary signals to ascertain the nature of dark sector in experiments detecting primordial features in the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum and laboratory searches for long-lived particles. We give explicit examples of global and local U(1) gauge extended dark sectors to demonstrate such a complementarity as the union of the two experiments reveals more information about the dark sector than either experiment. Demanding that Higgs-portal long-lived scalar be looked for, in various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, we identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW detectors such as LISA and ET.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: Debye mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some scenarios for the early universe, non-relativistic thermal dark matter chemically decouples from the thermal environment once the temperature drops below the Hubble rate. The value at which the energy density freezes out depends on the underlying model. In a simple setting, we provide a comprehensive study of heavy fermionic dark matter interacting with the light degrees of freedom of a dark thermal sector whose temperature $T$ decreases from an initial value close to the freeze-out temperature. Different temperatures imply different hierarchies of energy scales. By exploiting the methods of non-relativistic effective field theories at finite $T$, we systematically determine the thermal and in-vacuum interaction rates. In particular, we address the impact of the Debye mass on the observables and ultimately on the dark matter relic abundance. We numerically compare the corrections to the present energy density originating from the resummation of Debye mass effects with the corrections coming from a next-to-leading order treatment of the bath-particle interactions. We observe that the fixed-order calculation of the inelastic heavy-light scattering at high temperatures provides a larger dark matter depletion, and hence an undersized yield for given benchmark points in the parameter space, with respect to the calculation where Debye mass effects are resummed.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing analysis of SPT-CLJ2325$-$4111 and SPT-CLJ0049$-$2440, two Powerful Cosmic Telescopes ($R_E &gt; 40''$) from the SPT Clusters Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results from a study of two massive ($M_{500c} &gt; 6.0 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) strong lensing clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope cluster survey for their high Einstein radius ($R_E &gt; 40''$), SPT-CLJ2325$-$4111 and SPT-CLJ0049$-$2440. Ground-based and shallow HST imaging indicated extensive strong lensing evidence in these fields, with giant arcs spanning 18\arcsec\ and 31\arcsec, respectively, motivating further space-based imaging followup. Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL\,J2325$-$4111 and SPT-CL\,J0049$-$2440 were optimized using 9, and 8 secure multiple-imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0\farcs63 and 0\farcs73, respectively. From the lensing analysis, we measure the projected mass density within 500~kpc of $M(&lt;500 ~{\rm kpc}) = 7.30\pm0.07 \times 10^{14}$$M_{\odot}$, and $M(&lt;500 ~{\rm kpc})=7.12^{+0.16}_{-0.19}\times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ for these two clusters, and a sub-halos mass ratio of $0.12\pm{0.01}$ and $0.21^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, respectively. Both clusters produce a large area with high magnification ($\mu\geq 3$) for a source at $z=9$, $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=4.93^{+0.03}_{-0.04} arcmin^2$, and $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=3.64^{+0.14}_{-0.10} arcmin^2$ respectively, placing them in the top tier of strong lensing clusters. We conclude that these clusters are spectacular sightlines for further observations that will reduce the systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance. This paper provides the community with two additional well-calibrated cosmic telescopes, as strong as the Frontier Fields, suitable for studies of the highly magnified background Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a simple self-interacting neutrino cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some cosmic microwave background (CMB) data allow a cosmological scenario in which the free streaming of neutrinos is delayed until close to matter-radiation equality. Interestingly, recent analyses have revealed that large-scale structure (LSS) data also align with this scenario, discarding the possibility of an accidental feature in the CMB sky and calling for further investigation into the free-streaming nature of neutrinos. By assuming a simple representation of self-interacting neutrinos, we investigate whether this nonstandard scenario can accommodate a consistent cosmology for both the CMB power spectra and the large-scale distribution of galaxies simultaneously. Employing three different approaches - a profile likelihood exploration, a nested sampling method, and a heuristic Metropolis-Hasting approximation - we exhaustively explore the parameter space and demonstrate that galaxy data exacerbates the challenge already posed by the Planck polarization data for this nonstandard scenario. We find that the Bayes factor disfavor strong interactions among neutrinos over the $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM + $N_\mathrm{eff}$ + $\sum m_\nu$ models with odds of $7:10000$ and $23:1000$, respectively, providing large evidence against the simple self-interacting neutrino model. Our analysis emphasizes the need to consider a broader range of phenomenologies in the early Universe. We also highlight significant numerical and theoretical challenges ahead in uncovering the exact nature of the feature observed in the data or, ultimately, confirming the standard chronological evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Using New Slow-Roll Approximations considering Generalised Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations results reported by {\it Planck} satellite suggest a plateau characteristic in the flat potential of the inflaton field is favored to drive the Universe's early acceleration. On that note, Power Law Plateau (PLP) potential has gained a lot of attention. In this study, we demonstrate that implementing this inflationary model in an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity background makes the model compatible with observations while avoiding late-stage thermal inflation which is otherwise unavoidable in a standard scenario. More importantly, we have taken the PLP model as a case study to check the new slow-roll approximations method proposed in \cite{Pozdeeva:2024ihc}. Then we take one step further to check the consequence of generalized reheating in this scenario. Thus opening a new promising window to study inflationary dynamics in EGB gravity.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Do Unusually Cold Starburst Galaxies Exist? A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report observations of CO($J$=9$\to$8) and OH$^+$($N$=1$\to$0) toward the four millimeter-selected lensed starburst galaxies SPT 2354-58, 0150-59, 0314-44, and 0452-50, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Compact Array (ALMA/ACA), as part of a larger study of OH$^+$ in the early universe. In this work, we use these observations for the main purpose of spectroscopic redshift measurements. For all sources except SPT 0452-50, we confirm the previously reported most likely redshifts, and we find typical CO and OH$^+$ properties for massive starbursts. For SPT 0452-50, we rule out the previously reported value of $z$=2.0105, measuring a firm redshift of $z$=5.0160 based on [OI], [CII], H$_2$O, and CO emission instead when adding in ancillary ALMA data. Previously, SPT 0452-50 was considered an outlier in relations between dust temperature, far-infrared luminosity and redshift, which may have hinted at an unusually cold starburst with a dust temperature of only $T_{\rm dust}$=(21$\pm$2) K. Instead, our new measurements suggest it to be among highly luminous massive dusty starbursts at $z$$&gt;$5, with rather typical properties within that population. We find a revised dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}$=(76.2$\pm$2.5) K, and an updated lensing-corrected far-infrared luminosity (42.5-122.5 $\mu$m) of (2.35$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$)$\times$10$^{13}$ $L_\odot$ - i.e., about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. We thus do not find evidence for the existence of unusually cold starburst galaxies in the early universe that were missed by previous selection techniques.</description>

      <title>Improving the detection sensitivity to primordial stochastic gravitational waves with reduced astrophysical foregrounds. II. Subthreshold binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) consist of a primordial component from early Universe processes and an astrophysical component from compact binary mergers. To detect the primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB), the astrophysical foregrounds must be reduced to high precision, which is achievable for third-generation (3G) ground based GW detectors. Previous studies have shown that the foreground from individually detectable merger events can be reduced with fractional residual energy density below $10^{-3}$, and the residual foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNSs) will be the bottleneck if not well cleaned. In this work, we propose that the foreground energy density of subthreshold BNSs $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be estimated via a population based approach from the individually detectable BNSs utilizing the isotropic orbital orientations of all BNSs, i.e., uniform distribution in $\cos\iota$, where $\iota$ is the BNS inclination angle with respect to the line of sight. Using this approach, we find $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be measured with percent-level uncertainty, assuming $O(10^5)$ individually detected BNSs in our simulations. This method represents a promising approach to tackling the foreground cleaning problem.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Sectors in Supernovae Can Behave as a Relativistic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN 1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here, we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Back to the phase space: thermal axion dark radiation via couplings to standard model fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological consequences of axion interactions with standard model fermions accurately and precisely. Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>
