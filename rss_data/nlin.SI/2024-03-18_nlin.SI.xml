      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations and pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Painlev\'e equations constitute a famous class of integrable non-autonomous second order difference equations. A classification scheme proposed by Sakai interprets a discrete Painlev\'e equation as a birational map between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). Sakai's classification is thus based on the classification of generalized Halphen surfaces. We propose a novel geometric interpretation of discrete Painlev\'e equations, where the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as a birational transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one, according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$.
  While historically discrete Painlev\'e equations appeared as de-autonomizations of QRT maps, in our scheme they are viewed as deformations of 3D QRT maps introduced in our previous paper. A 3D QRT map is defined geometrically as a composition of involutions along generators of quadrics of a pencil, preserving the intersection curves with a second pencil of quadrics. The base set of the net of quadrics spanned by both pencils consists of eight points (which play the role of the eight blow-up points of generalized Halphen surfaces). A Painlev\'e deformation of a 3D QRT map is obtained by composing involutions along generators with a birational (often linear) transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ under which the pencil remains invariant, but the individual quadrics are mapped according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter.</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions for the possibility to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. Several new integrable equations and discrete substitutions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dispersionless limit of the recently introduced Toda lattice hierarchy with constraint of type B (the B-Toda hierarchy) and compare it with that of the DKP and C-Toda hierarchies. The dispersionless limits of the B-Toda and C-Toda hierarchies turn out to be the same.</description>
