      <title>Fermion determinants on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm to compute the logarithm of the determinant of the fermion matrix, assuming access to a classical lattice gauge field configuration. The algorithm uses the quantum eigenvalue transform, and quantum mean estimation, giving a query complexity that scales like $O(V\log(V))$ in the matrix dimension $V$.</description>

      <title>Modified Abelian and SU(2) Wilson theories on a lattice from a non-compact regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiflavour gauge theories of matter systems on a three-dimensional lattice have recently been widely investigated especially in connection with a possible symmetry enlargement at a continuous phase transition. Abelian models were studied both with compact gauge fields and in a mixed formulation in which the coupling with matter fields is in compact form while the gauge fields Lagrangian is written in terms of non-compact gauge fields, getting quite different results. Such a mixed formulation is not permissible for non-Abelian theories, for which however there exists an entirely non-compact formulation (in which exact gauge invariance is enforced by help of auxiliary fields), that for SU(2) was shown to yield in the scaling window a larger physical volume than Wilson's one. The corresponding U(1) non-compact regularization is derived in the present work. In both Abelian and SU(2) cases there is only one auxiliary field which for large mass has a linear coupling with the other fields and it can be integrated out. The coupling with the auxiliary field might make the inversion of the fermion matrix easier.</description>

      <title>First lattice QCD calculation of $J/\psi$ semileptonic decay containing $D$ and $D_s$ particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice calculation on the semileptonic decay of $J/\psi$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. Three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from 0.0519 fm to 0.1053 fm, and pion masses, $m_{\pi}\sim$ 300 MeV, are utilized. After a naive continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D_s e\nu_e)=1.90(6)(5)_{V_{cs}}\times 10^{-10}$ and $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D e\nu_e)=1.21(6)(9)_{V_{cd}}\times 10^{-11}$, where the first errors are statistical, and the second come from the uncertainties of CKM matrix element $V_{cs(d)}$. The ratios of the branching fractions between lepton $\mu$ and $e$ are also calculated as $R_{J/\psi}(D_s)=0.97002(8)$ and $R_{J/\psi}(D)=0.97423(15)$ after performing a continuum limit including only $a^2$ term. The ratios provide necessary theoretical support for the future experimental test of lepton flavor universality.</description>

      <title>Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD result for the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron. Our calculation includes both quark-connected and -disconnected diagrams and assesses all sources of systematic uncertainties arising from excited-state contributions, finite-volume effects and the continuum extrapolation. At the physical point, we obtain for the proton $r_Z^p = ( 1.013 \pm 0.010\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_F^p = ( 1.301 \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.014\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$. These numbers suggest small values of the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton, but are compatible with most of the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Digitizing lattice gauge theories in the magnetic basis: reducing the breaking of the fundamental commutation relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a digitization scheme for the lattice $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory Hamiltonian in the $\mathit{magnetic}$ $\mathit{basis}$, where the gauge links are unitary and diagonal. The digitization is obtained from a particular partitioning of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ group manifold, with the canonical momenta constructed by an approximation of the Lie derivatives on this partitioning. This construction, analogous to a discrete Fourier transform, preserves the spectrum of the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian and the canonical commutation relations exactly on a subspace of the truncated Hilbert space, while the residual subspace can be projected above the cutoff of the theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of ($\mathbf{2+1}$)-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopole Current Networks in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory predictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=3\mu_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Real-time Dynamics of the Schwinger Model as an Open Quantum System with Neural Density Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\Xi_c^* \bar K$ molecular pentaquark state by its electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as $\mu_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu_N$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\rm{fm^2}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.</description>
