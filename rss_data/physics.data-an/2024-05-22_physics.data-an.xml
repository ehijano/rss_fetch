      <title>Decomposing causality into its synergistic, unique, and redundant components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality lies at the heart of scientific inquiry, serving as the fundamental basis for understanding interactions among variables in physical systems. Despite its central role, current methods for causal inference face significant challenges due to nonlinear dependencies, stochastic interactions, self-causation, collider effects, and influences from exogenous factors, among others. While existing methods can effectively address some of these challenges, no single approach has successfully integrated all these aspects. Here, we address these challenges with SURD: Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition of causality. SURD quantifies causality as the increments of redundant, unique, and synergistic information gained about future events from past observations. The formulation is non-intrusive and applicable to both computational and experimental investigations, even when samples are scarce. We benchmark SURD in scenarios that pose significant challenges for causal inference and demonstrate that it offers a more reliable quantification of causality compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>SkyCURTAINs: Model agnostic search for Stellar Streams with Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SkyCURTAINs, a data driven and model agnostic method to search for stellar streams in the Milky Way galaxy using data from the Gaia telescope. SkyCURTAINs is a weakly supervised machine learning algorithm that builds a background enriched template in the signal region by leveraging the correlation of the source's characterising features with their proper motion in the sky. This allows for a more representative template of the background in the signal region, and reduces the false positives in the search for stellar streams. The minimal model assumptions in the SkyCURTAINs method allow for a flexible and efficient search for various kinds of anomalies such as streams, globular clusters, or dwarf galaxies directly from the data. We test the performance of SkyCURTAINs on the GD-1 stream and show that it is able to recover the stream with a purity of 75.4% which is an improvement of over 10% over existing machine learning based methods while retaining a signal efficiency of 37.9%.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining conformational dynamics with multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation: how, when, and why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data-driven ab initio generalized Langevin equation (AIGLE) approach is developed to learn and simulate high-dimensional, heterogeneous, coarse-grained conformational dynamics. Constrained by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the approach can build coarse-grained models in dynamical consistency with all-atom molecular dynamics. We also propose practical criteria for AIGLE to enforce long-term dynamical consistency. Case studies of a toy polymer, with 20 coarse-grained sites, and the alanine dipeptide, with two dihedral angles, elucidate why one should adopt AIGLE or its Markovian limit for modeling coarse-grained conformational dynamics in practice.</description>

      <title>Method of Kinetic Energy Reconstruction from Time-of-Flight Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the reconstruction of ion kinetic energy distributions from ion time-of-flight mass spectra through ion trajectory simulations. In particular, this method is applicable to complicated spectrometer geometries with largely anisotropic ion collection efficiencies. A calibration procedure using a single ion mass peak allows the accurate determination of parameters related to the spectrometer calibration, experimental alignment and instrument response function, which improves the agreement between simulations and experiment. The calibrated simulation is used to generate a set of basis functions for the time-of-flight spectra, which are then used to transform from time-of-flight to kinetic-energy spectra. We demonstrate this reconstruction method on a recent pump-probe experiment by Asmussen et al. (J. D. Asmussen et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 23, 15138, (2021)) on helium nanodroplets and retrieve time-resolved kinetic-energy-release spectra for the ions from ion time-of-flight spectra.</description>

      <title>Review on modeling the societal impact of infrastructure disruptions due to disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure systems play a critical role in providing essential products and services for the functioning of modern society; however, they are vulnerable to disasters and their service disruptions can cause severe societal impacts. To protect infrastructure from disasters and reduce potential impacts, great achievements have been made in modeling interdependent infrastructure systems in past decades. In recent years, scholars have gradually shifted their research focus to understanding and modeling societal impacts of disruptions considering the fact that infrastructure systems are critical because of their role in societal functioning, especially under situations of modern societies. Exploring how infrastructure disruptions impair society to enhance resilient city has become a key field of study. By comprehensively reviewing relevant studies, this paper demonstrated the definition and types of societal impact of infrastructure disruptions, and summarized the modeling approaches into four types: extended infrastructure modeling approaches, empirical approaches, agent-based approaches, and big data-driven approaches. For each approach, this paper organized relevant literature in terms of modeling ideas, advantages, and disadvantages. Furthermore, the four approaches were compared according to several criteria, including the input data, types of societal impact, and application scope. Finally, this paper illustrated the challenges and future research directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inference of Plate Bending from Heterogeneous Data: Physics-informed Gaussian Processes via Kirchhoff-Love Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in machine learning and an abundance of structural monitoring data have inspired the integration of mechanical models with probabilistic models to identify a structure's state and quantify the uncertainty of its physical parameters and response. In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.</description>

      <title>Principal component analysis of absorbing state phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Resonance Searches via Signature-Oriented Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for heavy resonances beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is a key objective at the LHC. While the recent use of advanced deep neural networks for boosted-jet tagging significantly enhances the sensitivity of dedicated searches, it is limited to specific final states, leaving vast potential BSM phase space underexplored. We introduce a novel experimental method, Signature-Oriented Pre-training for Heavy-resonance ObservatioN (Sophon), which leverages deep learning to cover an extensive number of boosted final states. Pre-trained on the comprehensive JetClass-II dataset, the Sophon model learns intricate jet signatures, ensuring the optimal constructions of various jet tagging discriminates and enabling high-performance transfer learning capabilities. We show that the method can not only push widespread model-specific searches to their sensitivity frontier, but also greatly improve model-agnostic approaches, accelerating LHC resonance searches in a broad sense.</description>

      <title>Cluster Scanning: a novel approach to resonance searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model-independent method for new physics searches called Cluster Scanning. It uses the k-means algorithm to perform clustering in the space of low-level event or jet observables, and separates potentially anomalous clusters to construct a signal-enriched region. The spectra of a selected observable (e.g. invariant mass) in these two regions are then used to determine whether a resonant signal is present. A pseudo-analysis on the LHC Olympics dataset with a $Z'$ resonance shows that Cluster Scanning outperforms the widely used 4-parameter functional background fitting procedures, reducing the number of signal events needed to reach a $3\sigma$ significant access by a factor of 0.61. Emphasis is placed on the speed of the method, which allows the test statistic to be calibrated on synthetic data.</description>
