      <title>Thermal quenching of classical and semiclassical scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum scrambling often gives rise to short-time exponential growth in out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). The scrambling rate over an isolated saddle point at finite temperature is shown here to be reduced by a hierarchy of quenching processes. Two of these appear in the classical limit, where escape from the neighbourhood of the saddle reduces the rate by a factor of two, and thermal fluctuations around the saddle reduce it further; a third process can be explained semiclassically as arising from quantum thermal fluctuations around the saddle, which are also responsible for imposing the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound.</description>

      <title>Attractor reconstruction with reservoir computers: The effect of the reservoir's conditional Lyapunov exponents on faithful attractor reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that has been shown to be able to replicate the chaotic attractor, including the fractal dimension and the entire Lyapunov spectrum, of the dynamical system on which it is trained. We quantitatively relate the generalized synchronization dynamics of a driven reservoir during the training stage to the performance of the trained reservoir computer at the attractor reconstruction task. We show that, in order to obtain successful attractor reconstruction and Lyapunov spectrum estimation, the largest conditional Lyapunov exponent of the driven reservoir must be significantly more negative than the most negative Lyapunov exponent of the target system. We also find that the maximal conditional Lyapunov exponent of the reservoir depends strongly on the spectral radius of the reservoir adjacency matrix, and therefore, for attractor reconstruction and Lyapunov spectrum estimation, small spectral radius reservoir computers perform better in general. Our arguments are supported by numerical examples on well-known chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Antipersistent energy current correlations in strong long-ranged Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heat transfer in one-dimensional Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type systems with long-range (LR) interactions. The strength of the LR interaction between two lattice sites decays as a power $\sigma$ of the inverse of their distance. We focus on the strong LR regime ($0\leq \sigma \leq1$) and show that the thermal transport behaviors are remarkably nuanced. Specifically, we observe that the antipersistent (negative) energy current correlation in this regime is intricately dependent on $\sigma$, displaying a nonmonotonic variation. Notably, a significant qualitative change occurs at $\sigma_c=0.5$, where with respect to other $\sigma$ values, the correlation shows a minimum negative value. Furthermore, our findings also demonstrate that within the long-time range considered, these antipersistent correlations will eventually vanish for certain $\sigma &gt;0.5$. The underlying mechanisms behind these intriguing phenomena are related to the crossover of two diverse space-time scaling properties of equilibrium heat correlations and the various scattering processes of phonons and discrete breathers.</description>
