      <title>Integrable systems with symmetries: toric, semitoric, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an overview of the theory of integrable systems with symmetries, focusing on toric systems, semitoric systems, and their classifications via decorated polygons. We discuss certain one-parameter families of integrable systems called semitoric families, and explain how deforming systems through controlled bifurcations in such families (and their generalizations) can be used to construct explicit semitoric systems with prescribed invariants. The first part of the paper serves as a quick introduction to integrable systems for newcomers to the field, such as graduate students, while the majority of the exposition surveys recent developments and technical details that will be of interest to experts. It closes with a look at future directions, including hypersemitoric systems and complexity one integrable systems.</description>

      <title>KP solitons and the Schottky uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

      <title>Collapsing in polygonal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygonal dynamics is a family of dynamical systems containing many studied systems, like the famous pentagram map. Similar collapsing phenomena seem to occur in most of these systems. We give a unifying, general definition of polygonal dynamics, and conjecture that a generic orbit collapses towards a predictable point. We manage to prove it in some setting. For the special case of ``closed polygons'', we show as a corollary that the collapse point depends algebraicly on the vertices of the starting polygon, using tools called scaling symmetry and infinitesimal monodromy. This generalizes previous results about the pentagram map. Then, we investigate the case of polygonal dynamics in $\mathbb{P}^1$ for which we give an explicit polynomial equation satisfied by the collapse point. Based on previous works, we define a new dynamical system, the ``staircase'' cross-ratio dynamics, for which we study particular configurations.</description>
