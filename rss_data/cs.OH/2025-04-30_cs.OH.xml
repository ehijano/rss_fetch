      <title>A Novel Multilevel Taxonomical Approach for Describing High-Dimensional Unlabeled Movement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movement data is prevalent across various applications and scientific fields, often characterized by its massive scale and complexity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in summarizing and describing such data, enabling researchers to generate insights and support scientific hypotheses. Despite its importance, traditional EDA practices face limitations when applied to high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data. The complexity and multi-faceted nature of this type of data require more advanced methods that go beyond the capabilities of current EDA techniques. This study addresses the gap in current EDA practices by proposing a novel approach that leverages movement variable taxonomies and outlier detection. We hypothesize that organizing movement features into a taxonomy, and applying anomaly detection to combinations of taxonomic nodes, can reveal meaningful patterns and lead to more interpretable descriptions of the data. To test this hypothesis, we introduce TUMD, a new method that integrates movement taxonomies with outlier detection to enhance data analysis and interpretation. TUMD was evaluated across four diverse datasets of moving objects using fixed parameter values. Its effectiveness was assessed through two passes: the first pass categorized the majority of movement patterns as Kinematic, Geometric, or Hybrid for all datasets, while the second pass refined these behaviors into more specific categories such as Speed, Acceleration, or Indentation. TUMD met the effectiveness criteria in three datasets, demonstrating its ability to describe and refine movement behaviors. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that the combination of movement taxonomies and anomaly detection successfully uncovers meaningful and interpretable patterns within high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Cooperative Autonomous Car-sharing Services: Proof-of-Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a digital twin-empowered real-time optimal delivery system specifically validated through a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration of a real-world autonomous car-sharing service. This study integrates real-time data from roadside units (RSUs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) within a digital twin of a campus environment to address the dynamic challenges of urban traffic. The proposed system leverages the Age of Information (AoI) metric to optimize vehicle routing by maintaining data freshness and dynamically adapting to real-time traffic conditions. Experimental results from the PoC demonstrate a 22% improvement in delivery efficiency compared to conventional shortest-path methods that do not consider information freshness. Furthermore, digital twin-based simulation results demonstrate that this proposed system improves overall delivery efficiency by 12% and effectively reduces the peak average AoI by 23% compared to the conventional method, where each vehicle selects the shortest route without considering information freshness. This study confirms the practical feasibility of cooperative driving systems, highlighting their potential to enhance smart mobility solutions through scalable digital twin deployments in complex urban environments.</description>
