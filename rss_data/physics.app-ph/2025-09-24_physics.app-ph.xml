      <title>Sodium-Decorated Ennea-Graphene: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Capacity Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of safe, efficient, and reversible hydrogen storage materials is critical for advancing hydrogen-based energy technologies and achieving carbon-neutral goals. Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-, 6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable at 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further exhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane stiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the nonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of approximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene complex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV. The Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance, reversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\% H2). This capacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard hydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of 0.76~\AA) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300 K ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings position sodium-decorated Ennea-Graphene as a promising nanomaterial for next-generation hydrogen storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Self-injection locking dynamics with Raman actions in AlN microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-injection locking (SIL) of semiconductor lasers to on-chip microcavities enables significant laser noise purification and diverse nonlinear optical actions. Realizing nonlinear SIL in new material platforms is essential for advancing photonic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear SIL in AlN microcavities that generates stimulated Raman lasers (SRLs) and microcombs. We achieve SRL emission with an output power exceeding 10 mW and a fundamental linewidth below 70 Hz in the 1750 nm band. The Kerr effect further mediates stimulated emissions at the 2nd-Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies. Multi-time-scale thermal relaxations during turnkey SIL enable GHz-level frequency sweeps of the SRL and pump. Raman actions also render a Stokes platicon microcomb state with co-emission in the pump and Stokes bands. Hybrid-integrated crystalline microresonators can be a versatile platform to investigate nonlinear photon-phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>MeshODENet: A Graph-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Neural Network for Simulating Mesh-Based Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</description>

      <title>Quaternary crystals CdZnTeSe: Growth via the vertical Bridgman method with different compositions of raw materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium-doped semiconductor crystals CdZnTeSe with several different compositions of raw materials were grown via the vertical Bridgman method under high-pressure argon. For the first time, these crystals were obtained via a combined method from a mixture of simple and binary starting components. A theoretical analysis of the permissible reactions for obtaining multicomponent CdZnTeSe crystals from different compositions of starting materials was performed. The homogeneity of the distribution of the atomic composition and electrical resistance (in the dark and under illumination) of the obtained crystals was studied. Crystals grown via the new combined method presented the best homogeneity of composition and electrophysical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethylene glycol is a prebiotically relevant complex organic molecule detected in interstellar and cometary environments, yet quantitative low-energy electron-ethylene glycol scattering data remain limited for astrochemical modeling. This work presents an R-matrix study of low-energy electron collisions with ethylene glycol over the 0 to 12 eV energy range, using static exchange (SE), static exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models with 6-311G* and cc-pVTZ basis sets. We compute elastic, excitation, and differential cross sections within a close coupling framework. The dataset offers benchmark inputs for astrochemical models, supporting interpretation of ethylene glycol abundances in space and refining constraints on electron-induced prebiotic pathways.</description>

      <title>Low-energy electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile using the R-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aminoacetonitrile occupies a prime importance in the interface between astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry. Its detection in the ISM establishes it as part of the organic inventory of star-forming regions, while its role as a glycine precursor highlights its significance for origins-of-life scenarios. In this work, electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile has been studied using the R-matrix method in the low-energy range from 0 to 10 eV. The calculations were carried out within the C_s point group using static-exchange (SE), static-exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models, with two basis sets (6-311G* and cc-pVTZ). Various scattering observables such as elastic, excitation, momentum transfer, and differential cross sections were examined. Since aminoacetonitrile is a prebiotically relevant molecule, these findings provide valuable insight into electron-driven processes in complex organic systems and form a theoretical foundation for future work on electron-induced reactivity in prebiotic and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of power laws in hierarchical dynamics on multi-level graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-law distributions are widely recognized in complex systems physics as indicative of underlying complexity in interaction networks and critical macroscopic behavior. Previous studies, notably those of Newman and others, have emphasized the importance of network structure and dynamics in understanding the emergence of such statistical patterns and predicting extreme events. In this study, we investigate the emergence of power-law behavior in delay distributions within a multi-level hierarchical network of agents governed by simple priority rules. Using railway systems as a case study, we model the dynamics of high-speed and local trains agents assigned distinct priority levels-operating within a simplified hierarchical network framework. By introducing Laplacian-distributed stochastic fluctuations into scheduled travel times, derived from empirical data, we observe that local trains exhibit a markedly higher incidence of higher delays than high-speed trains. To account for this phenomenon, we propose a queue-based dynamical model, calibrated using Italian railway data, and validate our findings through comparative analysis with both Italian and German datasets. The model accurately reproduces the empirically observed power-law exponent associated with the Italian local train delays. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of operational policies, such as priority assignment and delay compensation thresholds, revealing distinct cut-offs in delay distributions at 30 and 60 minutes for high-speed and local trains, respectively-corresponding to refund eligibility criteria in Italy. Such cut-offs are absent in the German case, where no comparable priority-change policies are in effect. These results underscore the capacity of simple hierarchical structures and rule-based dynamics to generate complex statistical behaviors without necessitating intricate interaction networks.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of oxidation and chlorine corrosion in Ni-based superalloys: The role of boron and light interstitial segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interaction of light interstitials in multi-element Ni-based alloys. We show that light interstitials such as boron and oxygen fundamentally alter interfacial chemistry by reshaping alloy-element distribution and segregation. Oxygen adsorption drove boron migration from the grain boundary to the free surface, where it co-enriched with Cr, Fe, and Mo and formed BO3 trigonal motifs embedded within mixed-metal oxide networks. Oxygen also promoted M-O-M chain formation, including Nb2O5 clusters at the free surface. In the absence of oxygen, boron segregated to the grain boundary, altering local metal chemistry and underscoring a dynamic, environment-sensitive behavior. Following chlorine exposure, the oxidized surfaces retained strong O-mediated connectivity while forming new Cl-M associations, particularly with Nb and Cr, and exhibited further surface enrichment in Cr, Fe, and Mo. High-temperature MD simulations revealed a dynamic tug-of-war: chlorine exerted upward pull and disrupted weakly anchored sites, while Nb- and BO3-rich oxide motifs resisted deformation. A new stabilization mechanism was identified in which subsurface boron atoms anchored overlying Cr centers, suppressing their mobility and mitigating chlorine-driven displacement. These results demonstrate boron's dual role as a modifier of alloy-element segregation and a stabilizer of oxide networks, and identify Nb as a key element in reinforcing cohesion under halogen attack. More broadly, this study highlights the need to track light interstitial cross-talk and solute migration under reactive conditions, offering atomistic criteria for designing corrosion-resistant surface chemistries in Ni-based superalloys exposed to halogenated or oxidative environments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Vertical $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes on Sapphire Using All-LPCVD Growth and Plasma-Free Ga-Assisted Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates quasi-vertical beta-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) fabricated on c-plane sapphire using an all-LPCVD, plasma-free process integrating epitaxial growth of high-quality beta-Ga2O3 and in-situ Ga-assisted etching. A 6.3 micron-thick (-201)-oriented beta-Ga2O3 layer was grown on c-sapphire with a 6-degree miscut, comprising a 3.15 micron moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer and a heavily doped (1e19 cm^-3) contact layer on a UID buffer. Mesa isolation used Ga-assisted LPCVD etching, producing a 60{\deg} inclined mesa sidewalls with an etch depth of 3.6 micron. SBDs showed excellent forward J-V behavior: 1.22 V turn-on, 1.29 ideality factor, and 0.83 eV barrier height. Minimum differential specific on-resistance was 8.6 mOhm*cm^2 with high current density (252 A/cm^2 at 5 V). C-V profiling revealed uniform doping at 2.1e17 cm^-3. J-V-T from 25 C to 250 C confirmed thermionic emission. Barrier height increased from 0.80 to 1.16 eV, and ideality factor from 1.31 to 1.42. Reverse leakage current remained low, increasing from ~5e-6 A/cm^2 to ~1e-4 A/cm^2; Ion/Ioff decreased from ~1e7 to 5e5. Breakdown voltages with moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer ranged between 73 and 100 V, with corresponding fields of 1.66 to 1.94 MV/cm. These results highlight the potential of LPCVD-grown and etched beta-Ga2O3 devices for high-performance power electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering Topological Phases with a Traveling-Wave Spacetime Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-variant systems have recently garnered considerable attention due to their unique potentials in manipulating electromagnetic waves. Here, a novel class of topological spacetime crystals is introduced, with a traveling-wave modulation that mimics certain aspects of physical motion. Challenging intuition, our findings reveal that, even though such systems rely on a linear momentum bias, it is feasible to engineer an internal angular momentum and non-trivial topological phases by leveraging the symmetry of its structural elements. Furthermore, these platforms exhibit a gauge degree of freedom associated with the arbitrariness in the choice of the coordinate transformation that eliminates the time dependence of the system Hamiltonian. The topology of the system is intricately governed by a synthetic magnetic potential whose field lines can be controlled by manipulating material anisotropy. Remarkably, the proposed spacetime crystals host an unconventional class of scattering-immune edge states, whose oscillation frequency adapts continuously along the propagation path, shaped by the geometric attributes of the path itself.</description>

      <title>Manipulating terahertz phonon-polariton in the ultrastrong coupling regime with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Transitioning from Silicon to Carbon Nanotube based transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.</description>

Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</description>

      <title>Digit classification using photonic reservoir computing based on a silicon microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.</description>
