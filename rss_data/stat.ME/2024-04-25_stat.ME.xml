      <title>Mapping Incidence and Prevalence Peak Data for SIR Forecasting Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious disease modeling and forecasting have played a key role in helping assess and respond to epidemics and pandemics. Recent work has leveraged data on disease peak infection and peak hospital incidence to fit compartmental models for the purpose of forecasting and describing the dynamics of a disease outbreak. Incorporating these data can greatly stabilize a compartmental model fit on early observations, where slight perturbations in the data may lead to model fits that project wildly unrealistic peak infection. We introduce a new method for incorporating historic data on the value and time of peak incidence of hospitalization into the fit for a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model by formulating the relationship between an SIR model's starting parameters and peak incidence as a system of two equations that can be solved computationally. This approach is assessed for practicality in terms of accuracy and speed of computation via simulation. To exhibit the modeling potential, we update the Dirichlet-Beta State Space modeling framework to use hospital incidence data, as this framework was previously formulated to incorporate only data on total infections.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing with anytime-valid Monte-Carlo p-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary problems involving genetic or neuroimaging data, thousands of hypotheses need to be tested. Due to their high power, and finite sample guarantees on type-1 error under weak assumptions, Monte-Carlo permutation tests are often considered as gold standard for these settings. However, the enormous computational effort required for (thousands of) permutation tests is a major burden. Recently, Fischer and Ramdas (2024) constructed a permutation test for a single hypothesis in which the permutations are drawn sequentially one-by-one and the testing process can be stopped at any point without inflating the type I error. They showed that the number of permutations can be substantially reduced (under null and alternative) while the power remains similar. We show how their approach can be modified to make it suitable for a broad class of multiple testing procedures. In particular, we discuss its use with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and illustrate the application on a large dataset.</description>

      <title>Greedy Capon Beamformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose greedy Capon beamformer (GBF) for direction finding of narrow-band sources present in the array's viewing field. After defining the grid covering the location search space, the algorithm greedily builds the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix by identifying a high-power source on the grid using Capon's principle of maximizing the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) while enforcing unit gain towards the signal of interest. An estimate of the power of the detected source is derived by exploiting the unit power constraint, which subsequently allows to update the noise covariance matrix by simple rank-1 matrix addition composed of outerproduct of the selected steering matrix with itself scaled by the signal power estimate. Our numerical examples demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed GCB in direction finding where it perform favourably compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms under a broad variety of settings. Furthermore, GCB estimates of direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) are very fast to compute.</description>

      <title>Exploring Convergence in Relation using Association Rules Mining: A Case Study in Collaborative Knowledge Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the pivotal role played by non-experts in knowledge production on open collaboration platforms, with a particular focus on the intricate process of tag development that culminates in the proposal of new glitch classes. Leveraging the power of Association Rule Mining (ARM), this research endeavors to unravel the underlying dynamics of collaboration among citizen scientists. By meticulously quantifying tag associations and scrutinizing their temporal dynamics, the study provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how non-experts collaborate to generate valuable scientific insights. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to examine the phenomenon of ideological convergence within online citizen science knowledge production. To accomplish this, a novel measurement algorithm, based on the Mann-Kendall Trend Test, is introduced. This innovative approach sheds illuminating light on the dynamics of collaborative knowledge production, revealing both the vast opportunities and daunting challenges inherent in leveraging non-expert contributions for scientific research endeavors. Notably, the study uncovers a robust pattern of convergence in ideology, employing both the newly proposed convergence testing method and the traditional approach based on the stationarity of time series data. This groundbreaking discovery holds significant implications for understanding the dynamics of online citizen science communities and underscores the crucial role played by non-experts in shaping the scientific landscape of the digital age. Ultimately, this study contributes significantly to our understanding of online citizen science communities, highlighting their potential to harness collective intelligence for tackling complex scientific tasks and enriching our comprehension of collaborative knowledge production processes in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, Imprecise Probabilities and Interval Capacity Measures on a Product Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Basili and Pratelli (2024), a novel and coherent concept of interval probability measures has been introduced, providing a method for representing imprecise probabilities and uncertainty. Within the framework of set algebra, we introduced the concepts of weak complementation and interval probability measures associated with a family of random variables, which effectively capture the inherent uncertainty in any event. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of these concepts within a specific probability space. Additionally, we elaborate on an updating rule for events, integrating essential concepts of statistical independence, dependence, and stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Loss Estimation on Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the shortcomings of Bayes posteriors as inferential devices has received increased attention. A popular strategy for fixing them has been to instead target a Gibbs measure based on losses that connect a parameter of interest to observed data. While existing theory for such inference procedures relies on these losses to be analytically available, in many situations these losses must be stochastically estimated using pseudo-observations. The current paper fills this research gap, and derives the first asymptotic theory for Gibbs measures based on estimated losses. Our findings reveal that the number of pseudo-observations required to accurately approximate the exact Gibbs measure depends on the rates at which the bias and variance of the estimated loss converge to zero. These results are particularly consequential for the emerging field of generalised Bayesian inference, for estimated intractable likelihoods, and for biased pseudo-marginal approaches. We apply our results to three Gibbs measures that have been proposed to deal with intractable likelihoods and model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Networks with Dependent Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an autoregressive framework for modelling dynamic networks with dependent edges. It encompasses the models which accommodate, for example, transitivity, density-dependent and other stylized features often observed in real network data. By assuming the edges of network at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in the straightforward manner. Due to the possible large number of parameters in the models, the initial MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration based on the projection which mitigates the impact of the other parameters (Chang et al., 2021, 2023). Based on a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the stationarity assumption. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, and it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions. Illustration with a transitivity model was carried out in both simulation and a real network data set.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the quality of a prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shannon defined the mutual information between two variables. We illustrate why the true mutual information between a variable and the predictions made by a prediction algorithm is not a suitable measure of prediction quality, but the apparent Shannon mutual information (ASI) is; indeed it is the unique prediction quality measure with either of two very different lists of desirable properties, as previously shown by de Finetti and other authors. However, estimating the uncertainty of the ASI is a difficult problem, because of long and non-symmetric heavy tails to the distribution of the individual values of $j(x,y)=\log\frac{Q_y(x)}{P(x)}$ We propose a Bayesian modelling method for the distribution of $j(x,y)$, from the posterior distribution of which the uncertainty in the ASI can be inferred. This method is based on Dirichlet-based mixtures of skew-Student distributions. We illustrate its use on data from a Bayesian model for prediction of the recurrence time of prostate cancer. We believe that this approach is generally appropriate for most problems, where it is infeasible to derive the explicit distribution of the samples of $j(x,y)$, though the precise modelling parameters may need adjustment to suit particular cases.</description>

      <title>Large-sample theory for inferential models: a possibilistic Bernstein--von Mises theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inferential model (IM) framework offers alternatives to the familiar probabilistic (e.g., Bayesian and fiducial) uncertainty quantification in statistical inference. Allowing this uncertainty quantification to be imprecise makes it possible to achieve exact validity and reliability. But is imprecision and exact validity compatible with attainment of the classical notions of statistical efficiency? The present paper offers an affirmative answer to this question via a new possibilistic Bernstein--von Mises theorem that parallels a fundamental result in Bayesian inference. Among other things, our result demonstrates that the IM solution is asymptotically efficient in the sense that its asymptotic credal set is the smallest that contains the Gaussian distribution whose variance agrees with the Cramer--Rao lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis is a popular unsupervised learning tool used in many disciplines to identify heterogeneous sub-populations within a sample. However, validating cluster analysis results and determining the number of clusters in a data set remains an outstanding problem. In this work, we present a global criterion called the Distinguishability criterion to quantify the separability of identified clusters and validate inferred cluster configurations. Our computational implementation of the Distinguishability criterion corresponds to the Bayes risk of a randomized classifier under the 0-1 loss. We propose a combined loss function-based computational framework that integrates the Distinguishability criterion with many commonly used clustering procedures, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and finite mixture models. We present these new algorithms as well as the results from comprehensive data analysis based on simulation studies and real data applications.</description>

      <title>Tests for partial correlation between repeatedly observed nonstationary nonlinear timeseries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe two families of statistical tests to detect partial correlation in vectorial timeseries. The tests measure whether an observed timeseries Y can be predicted from a second series X, even after accounting for a third series Z which may correlate with X. They do not make any assumptions on the nature of these timeseries, such as stationarity or linearity, but they do require that multiple statistically independent recordings of the 3 series are available. Intuitively, the tests work by asking if the series Y recorded on one experiment can be better predicted from X recorded on the same experiment than on a different experiment, after accounting for the prediction from Z recorded on both experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replication studies are increasingly conducted to assess the credibility of scientific findings. Most of these replication attempts target studies with a superiority design, but there is a lack of methodology regarding the analysis of replication studies with alternative types of designs, such as equivalence. In order to fill this gap, we propose two approaches, the two-trials rule and the sceptical TOST procedure, adapted from methods used in superiority settings. Both methods have the same overall Type-I error rate, but the sceptical TOST procedure allows replication success even for non-significant original or replication studies. This leads to a larger project power and other differences in relevant operating characteristics. Both methods can be used for sample size calculation of the replication study, based on the results from the original one. The two methods are applied to data from the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology.</description>

Abstract: We show that two procedures for false discovery rate (FDR) control -- the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure for dependent p-values, and the e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for dependent e-values -- can both be made more powerful by a simple randomization involving one independent uniform random variable. As a corollary, the Hommel test under arbitrary dependence is also improved. Importantly, our randomized improvements are never worse than the originals and are typically strictly more powerful, with marked improvements in simulations. The same technique also improves essentially every other multiple testing procedure based on e-values.</description>

      <title>Multi-Study R-Learner for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Across Studies Using Statistical Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for precision medicine. While multiple studies can improve the generalizability of results, leveraging them for estimation is statistically challenging. Existing approaches often assume identical HTEs across studies, but this may be violated due to various sources of between-study heterogeneity, including differences in study design, study populations, and data collection protocols, among others. To this end, we propose a framework for multi-study HTE estimation that accounts for between-study heterogeneity in the nuisance functions and treatment effects. Our approach, the multi-study R-learner, extends the R-learner to obtain principled statistical estimation with machine learning (ML) in the multi-study setting. It involves a data-adaptive objective function that links study-specific treatment effects with nuisance functions through membership probabilities, which enable information to be borrowed across potentially heterogeneous studies. The multi-study R-learner framework can combine data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or a combination of both. It's easy to implement and flexible in its ability to incorporate ML for estimating HTEs, nuisance functions, and membership probabilities. In the series estimation framework, we show that the multi-study R-learner is asymptotically normal and more efficient than the R-learner when there is between-study heterogeneity in the propensity score model under homoscedasticity. We illustrate using cancer data that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing approaches in the presence of between-study heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qini curves have emerged as an attractive and popular approach for evaluating the benefit of data-driven targeting rules for treatment allocation. We propose a generalization of the Qini curve to multiple costly treatment arms, that quantifies the value of optimally selecting among both units and treatment arms at different budget levels. We develop an efficient algorithm for computing these curves and propose bootstrap-based confidence intervals that are exact in large samples for any point on the curve. These confidence intervals can be used to conduct hypothesis tests comparing the value of treatment targeting using an optimal combination of arms with using just a subset of arms, or with a non-targeting assignment rule ignoring covariates, at different budget levels. We demonstrate the statistical performance in a simulation experiment and an application to treatment targeting for election turnout.</description>

      <title>Contour Location for Reliability in Airfoil Simulation Experiments using Deep Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) outperform ordinary GPs as surrogate models of complex computer experiments when response surface dynamics are non-stationary, which is especially prevalent in aerospace simulations. Yet DGP surrogates have not been deployed for the canonical downstream task in that setting: reliability analysis through contour location (CL). In that context, we are motivated by a simulation of an RAE-2822 transonic airfoil which demarcates efficient and inefficient flight conditions. Level sets separating passable versus failable operating conditions are best learned through strategic sequential design. There are two limitations to modern CL methodology which hinder DGP integration in this setting. First, derivative-based optimization underlying acquisition functions is thwarted by sampling-based Bayesian (i.e., MCMC) inference, which is essential for DGP posterior integration. Second, canonical acquisition criteria, such as entropy, are famously myopic to the extent that optimization may even be undesirable. Here we tackle both of these limitations at once, proposing a hybrid criterion that explores along the Pareto front of entropy and (predictive) uncertainty, requiring evaluation only at strategically located "triangulation" candidates. We showcase DGP CL performance in several synthetic benchmark exercises and on the RAE-2822 airfoil.</description>

      <title>Consistency of common spatial estimators under spatial confounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the asymptotic performance of popular spatial regression estimators on the task of estimating the linear effect of an exposure on an outcome under "spatial confounding" -- the presence of an unmeasured spatially-structured variable influencing both the exposure and the outcome. The existing literature on spatial confounding is informal and inconsistent; this paper is an attempt to bring clarity through rigorous results on the asymptotic bias and consistency of estimators from popular spatial regression models. We consider two data generation processes: one where the confounder is a fixed function of space and one where it is a random function (i.e., a stochastic process on the spatial domain). We first show that the estimators from ordinary least squares (OLS) and restricted spatial regression are asymptotically biased under spatial confounding. We then prove a novel main result on the consistency of the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator using a Gaussian process (GP) covariance matrix in the presence of spatial confounding under in-fill (fixed domain) asymptotics. The result holds under very general conditions -- for any exposure with some non-spatial variation (noise), for any spatially continuous confounder, using any choice of Mat\'ern or square exponential Gaussian process covariance used to construct the GLS estimator, and without requiring Gaussianity of errors. Finally, we prove that spatial estimators from GLS, GP regression, and spline models that are consistent under confounding by a fixed function will also be consistent under confounding by a random function. We conclude that, contrary to much of the literature on spatial confounding, traditional spatial estimators are capable of estimating linear exposure effects under spatial confounding in the presence of some noise in the exposure. We support our theoretical arguments with simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for the Latent Shrinkage Position Model</title>

Abstract: The latent position model (LPM) is a popular method used in network data analysis where nodes are assumed to be positioned in a $p$-dimensional latent space. The latent shrinkage position model (LSPM) is an extension of the LPM which automatically determines the number of effective dimensions of the latent space via a Bayesian nonparametric shrinkage prior. However, the LSPM reliance on Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference, while rigorous, is computationally expensive, making it challenging to scale to networks with large numbers of nodes. We introduce a variational inference approach for the LSPM, aiming to reduce computational demands while retaining the model's ability to intrinsically determine the number of effective latent dimensions. The performance of the variational LSPM is illustrated through simulation studies and its application to real-world network data. To promote wider adoption and ease of implementation, we also provide open-source code.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of a Simple Quaternion Estimator: Proof of the Bias and Covariance Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reference [1] introduces a novel closed-form quaternion estimator from two vector observations. The simplicity of the estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The latter could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. The current note relaxes the second-order assumption and provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. This not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity. This technical note presents a comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian factor analysis model for high-dimensional microbiome count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimension reduction techniques are among the most essential analytical tools in the analysis of high-dimensional data. Generalized principal component analysis (PCA) is an extension to standard PCA that has been widely used to identify low-dimensional features in high-dimensional discrete data, such as binary, multi-category and count data. For microbiome count data in particular, the multinomial PCA is a natural counterpart of the standard PCA. However, this technique fails to account for the excessive number of zero values, which is frequently observed in microbiome count data. To allow for sparsity, zero-inflated multivariate distributions can be used. We propose a zero-inflated probabilistic PCA model for latent factor analysis. The proposed model is a fully Bayesian factor analysis technique that is appropriate for microbiome count data analysis. In addition, we use the mean-field-type variational family to approximate the marginal likelihood and develop a classification variational approximation algorithm to fit the model. We demonstrate the efficiency of our procedure for predictions based on the latent factors and the model parameters through simulation experiments, showcasing its superiority over competing methods. This efficiency is further illustrated with two real microbiome count datasets. The method is implemented in R.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Risk Estimation in the Normal Means Problem via Coupled Bootstrap Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for estimating the risk of an arbitrary estimator of the mean vector in the classical normal means problem. The key idea is to generate two auxiliary data vectors, by adding carefully constructed normal noise vectors to the original data. We then train the estimator of interest on the first auxiliary vector and test it on the second. In order to stabilize the risk estimate, we average this procedure over multiple draws of the synthetic noise vector. A key aspect of this coupled bootstrap (CB) approach is that it delivers an unbiased estimate of risk under no assumptions on the estimator of the mean vector, albeit for a modified and slightly "harder" version of the original problem, where the noise variance is elevated. We prove that, under the assumptions required for the validity of Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), a limiting version of the CB estimator recovers SURE exactly. We then analyze a bias-variance decomposition of the error of the CB estimator, which elucidates the effects of the variance of the auxiliary noise and the number of bootstrap samples on the accuracy of the estimator. Lastly, we demonstrate that the CB estimator performs favorably in various simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparing baseball players across eras via novel Full House Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new methodological framework suitable for era-adjusting baseball statistics is developed in this article. Within this methodological framework specific models are motivated. We call these models Full House Models. Full House Models work by balancing the achievements of Major League Baseball (MLB) players within a given season and the size of the MLB talent pool from which a player came. We demonstrate the utility of Full House Models in an application of comparing baseball players' performance statistics across eras. Our results reveal a new ranking of baseball's greatest players which include several modern players among the top all-time players. Modern players are elevated by Full House Modeling because they come from a larger talent pool. Sensitivity and multiverse analyses which investigate the how results change with changes to modeling inputs including the estimate of the talent pool are presented.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid t-tests and confidence sequences for Gaussian means with unknown variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1976, Lai constructed a nontrivial confidence sequence for the mean $\mu$ of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Curiously, he employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper (flat) mixture over $\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not yield an "e-process" (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null, as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting confidence sequences, which have a curious polynomial dependence on the error probability $\alpha$ that we prove to be not only unavoidable, but (for universal inference) even better than the classical fixed-sample t-test. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and contrast the various approaches, including some recent suboptimal ones.</description>

      <title>Multiple change point detection in functional data with applications to biomechanical fatigue data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Injuries to the lower extremity joints are often debilitating, particularly for professional athletes. Understanding the onset of stressful conditions on these joints is therefore important in order to ensure prevention of injuries as well as individualised training for enhanced athletic performance. We study the biomechanical joint angles from the hip, knee and ankle for runners who are experiencing fatigue. The data is cyclic in nature and densely collected by body worn sensors, which makes it ideal to work with in the functional data analysis (FDA) framework.
  We develop a new method for multiple change point detection for functional data, which improves the state of the art with respect to at least two novel aspects. First, the curves are compared with respect to their maximum absolute deviation, which leads to a better interpretation of local changes in the functional data compared to classical $L^2$-approaches. Secondly, as slight aberrations are to be often expected in a human movement data, our method will not detect arbitrarily small changes but hunts for relevant changes, where maximum absolute deviation between the curves exceeds a specified threshold, say $\Delta &gt;0$. We recover multiple changes in a long functional time series of biomechanical knee angle data, which are larger than the desired threshold $\Delta$, allowing us to identify changes purely due to fatigue. In this work, we analyse data from both controlled indoor as well as from an uncontrolled outdoor (marathon) setting.</description>

      <title>An Economic Solution to Copyright Challenges of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>
