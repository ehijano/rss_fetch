      <title>Open Research Data in Spanish University Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current situation of open research data in Spanish university repositories is analyzed by means of twelve indicators that allow us to compare them with each other. The twelve self-developed indicators deal with research datasets and institutional policies linked to open access, as well as some of the key characteristics of the repositories. The methodology used consists of comparing the repositories of the different universities linked to REBIUN. The result has been that datasets in institutional repositories are scarce, and the situation is heterogeneous across the territory. This raises questions about future open access policies for research data in the country's main scientific institutions.</description>

      <title>A Bibliometric Analysis of Highly Cited Artificial Intelligence Publications in Science Citation Index Expanded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to identify and analyze the characteristics of highly cited publications in the field of artificial intelligence within the Science Citation Index Expanded from 1991 to 2022. The assessment focused on documents that garnered 100 citations or more from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning from their publication date to the end of 2022. Various aspects of these documents were analyzed, encompassing document types, the distribution of annual production, the average number of citations per publication, Web of Science categories, and journals. Moreover, the publication performance of countries, institutions, and authors underwent evaluation through six publication indicators and associated citation metrics. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison of the authors research performance, the Y-index was employed. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that a majority of the highly cited articles were published within the Web of Science categories of "artificial intelligence computer science" and "electrical and electronic engineering". Notably, the United States exhibited dominance across all six publication indicators. Within the realm of average citations per publication, the United Kingdom emerged as a leader for independent articles, first-author articles, and corresponding-author articles. Exceptionally, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA, contributed significantly. The significant impact of highly cited articles extended to the output of Stanford University in the USA. B.L. Bassler published the most highly cited articles. Upon employing the Y-index analysis, J.E.P. Santos was identified as having the highest potential for publication. In addition to the primary analysis, this study also presented nine classic articles that have left an indelible mark on artificial intelligence research.</description>

      <title>The Sixth Generation of the Perseus Digital Library and a Workflow for Open Philology -- DRAFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here on the workflow that we needed to develop in order to integrate the growing range of openly licensed, born-digital and, increasingly, machine actionable publications. Our developmental work focused upon textual data for Ancient Greek, Latin, Old English, Classical Arabic and Classical Persian but the challenges that we have had to address are relevant to sources in a wide range of languages, ancient and modern. Perseus 6 was designed to be a publishing workflow that organizes complementary data into an integrated reading environment. This document focuses on the ways in which we have organized the data and describes the current state of ATLAS (Aligned Text and Linguistic Annotation Server) architecture. While this is the sixth version of the Perseus Digital Library, Perseus 6 represents a major step beyond its predecessors. Where Perseus 5 (described below) can represent and integrate digital versions of print editions (e.g., critical editions with interactive textual notes, links to lexicon and commentary entries), Perseus 6 was designed to bring together an expandable range of born-digital classes of annotation. An online ATLAS server with some initial functionality is now online and public services will expand during the rest of 2024. Most of the ATLAS data is, however, now available on Github and that data will be the focus on this paper in its current version.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect of Group Diversity on Redundancy and Coverage in Peer-Reviewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large host of scientific journals and conferences solicit peer reviews from multiple reviewers for the same submission, aiming to gather a broader range of perspectives and mitigate individual biases. In this work, we reflect on the role of diversity in the slate of reviewers assigned to evaluate a submitted paper as a factor in diversifying perspectives and improving the utility of the peer-review process. We propose two measures for assessing review utility: review coverage -- reviews should cover most contents of the paper -- and review redundancy -- reviews should add information not already present in other reviews. We hypothesize that reviews from diverse reviewers will exhibit high coverage and low redundancy. We conduct a causal study of different measures of reviewer diversity on review coverage and redundancy using observational data from a peer-reviewed conference with approximately 5,000 submitted papers. Our study reveals disparate effects of different diversity measures on review coverage and redundancy. Our study finds that assigning a group of reviewers that are topically diverse, have different seniority levels, or have distinct publication networks leads to broader coverage of the paper or review criteria, but we find no evidence of an increase in coverage for reviewer slates with reviewers from diverse organizations or geographical locations. Reviewers from different organizations, seniority levels, topics, or publications networks (all except geographical diversity) lead to a decrease in redundancy in reviews. Furthermore, publication network-based diversity alone also helps bring in varying perspectives (that is, low redundancy), even within specific review criteria. Our study adopts a group decision-making perspective for reviewer assignments in peer review and suggests dimensions of diversity that can help guide the reviewer assignment process.</description>

      <title>Tenure and Research Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Ink and Parchment in Dead Sea Scroll Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls over 60 years ago is widely regarded as one of the greatest archaeological breakthroughs in modern history. Recent study of the scrolls presents ongoing computational challenges, including determining the provenance of fragments, clustering fragments based on their degree of similarity, and pairing fragments that originate from the same manuscript -- all tasks that require focusing on individual letter and fragment shapes. This paper presents a computational method for segmenting ink and parchment regions in multispectral images of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. Using the newly developed Qumran Segmentation Dataset (QSD) consisting of 20 fragments, we apply multispectral thresholding to isolate ink and parchment regions based on their unique spectral signatures. To refine segmentation accuracy, we introduce an energy minimization technique that leverages ink contours, which are more distinguishable from the background and less noisy than inner ink regions. Experimental results demonstrate that this Multispectral Thresholding and Energy Minimization (MTEM) method achieves significant improvements over traditional binarization approaches like Otsu and Sauvola in parchment segmentation and is successful at delineating ink borders, in distinction from holes and background regions.</description>

      <title>Econometrics and Formalism of Psychological Archetypes of Scientific Workers with Introverted Thinking Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chronological hierarchy and classification of psychological types of individuals are examined. The anomalous nature of psychological activity in individuals involved in scientific work is highlighted. Certain aspects of the introverted thinking type in scientific activities are analyzed. For the first time, psychological archetypes of scientists with pronounced introversion are postulated in the context of twelve hypotheses about the specifics of professional attributes of introverted scientific activities.
  A linear regression and Bayesian equation are proposed for quantitatively assessing the econometric degree of introversion in scientific employees, considering a wide range of characteristics inherent to introverts in scientific processing. Specifically, expressions for a comprehensive assessment of introversion in a linear model and the posterior probability of the econometric (scientometric) degree of introversion in a Bayesian model are formulated.
  The models are based on several econometric (scientometric) hypotheses regarding various aspects of professional activities of introverted scientists, such as a preference for solo publications, low social activity, narrow specialization, high research depth, and so forth. Empirical data and multiple linear regression methods can be used to calibrate the equations. The model can be applied to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological characteristics of scientific employees, which is particularly useful in ergonomics and the management of scientific teams and projects. The proposed method also provides scientists with pronounced introversion the opportunity to develop their careers, focusing on individual preferences and features.</description>

      <title>Web Archives Metadata Generation with GPT-4o: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.</description>
