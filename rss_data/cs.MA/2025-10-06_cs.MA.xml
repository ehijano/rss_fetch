      <title>AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.</description>

      <title>CLARITY: Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage), an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing, clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.</description>

      <title>Delay-Tolerant Augmented-Consensus-based Distributed Directed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning, data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.</description>

      <title>Axiomatisation for an asynchronous epistemic logic with sending and receiving messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a public announcement logic for asynchronous public announcements wherein the sending of the announcements by the environment is separated from the reception of the announcements by the individual agents. Both come with different modalities. In the logical semantics, formulas are interpreted in a world of a Kripke model but given a history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements that already happened. An axiomatisation AA for such a logic has been given in prior work, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model before any such announcements have taken place. This axiomatisation is a reduction system wherein one can show that every formula is equivalent to a purely epistemic formula without dynamic modalities for announcements and receptions. We propose a generalisation AA* of this axiomatisation, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model given any history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements. It does not extend the axiomatisation AA, for example it is no longer valid that nobody has received any announcement. Unlike AA, this axiomatisation AA* is infinitary and it is not a reduction system.</description>

      <title>Improving Cooperation in Collaborative Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</description>

      <title>MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.</description>

      <title>An Architecture for Spatial Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical spaces are increasingly dense with networked devices, promising seamless coordination and ambient intelligence. Yet today, cloud-first architectures force all communication through wide-area networks regardless of physical proximity. We lack an abstraction for spatial networking: using physical spaces to create boundaries for private, robust, and low-latency communication. We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</description>
