      <title>Unveiling nonlinearities of electromagnetically induced transparency in a THz metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in terahertz (THz) metamaterials relies on the coherent coupling between a radiative (bright) mode and a subradiant (dark) mode. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the bright and dark modes holds the key to manipulate the mutual interference and hence the transparency. Here, we use nonlinear 2D-THz spectroscopy to scrutinize the dynamics through nonlinearities of the EIT-like phenomenon in a metamaterial platform that comprises of two coupled resonators. From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators. The multi-peak nature of photon-echo signal and the corresponding temporal signatures further provides a direct visualization of the interference between the dressed states that drives the transparency window in our THz metamaterial. A time-resolved density matrix model accurately describes the observed features, including the cross-peak behavior and the temporal dynamics, establishing the coherent mode coupling as the origin of the transparency window.</description>

      <title>First-principles simulation of spin diffusion in static solids using dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Induced Magnon Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating magnon frequency combs (MFCs) with tunable spacing via a single-frequency driving is crucial for practical applications but it typically relies on complex spin textures like skyrmions or vortices. Here, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate MFC generation in geometrically curved ferromagnetic thin films using single-frequency microwave excitation, without topological spin textures. We first show that the curvature transforms the planar ferromagnetic resonance into a localized, redshifted magnon bound state, which, under non-resonant driving, activates sequential three-magnon scattering processes assisted by the curvature-driven effective anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It finally produces equally spaced, robust frequency combs with spacing exactly set by the bound mode frequency. Moreover, we find that the curvature gradient at the hybrid interface mimics an analog event horizon, with the bound state's redshift resembling gravitational effects in black hole physics. Micromagnetic simulations confirm these curvature-driven nonlinear phenomenon, unveiling a novel geometric strategy for controlling magnon interactions and advancing compact magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <title>Walsh-Floquet Theory of Periodic Kick Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.</description>
