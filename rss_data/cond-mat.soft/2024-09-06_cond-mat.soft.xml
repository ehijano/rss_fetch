      <title>Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Describes Transport in Cellular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological functionality of cellular aggregates is largely influenced by the activity and displacements of individual constituent cells. From a theoretical perspective this activity can be characterized by hydrodynamic transport coefficients of diffusivity and conductivity. Motivated by the clustering dynamics of bacterial microcolonies we propose a model of active multicellular aggregates and use recently developed macroscopic fluctuation theory to derive a fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model system. Both semi-analytic theory and microscopic simulations show that the hydrodynamic transport coefficients are affected by non-equilibrium microscopic parameters and significantly decrease inside of the clusters. We further find that the Einstein relation connecting the transport coefficients and fluctuations breaks down in the parameter regime where the detailed balance is not satisfied. This study offers valuable tools for experimental investigation of hydrodynamic transport in other systems of cellular aggregates such as tumor spheroids and organoids.</description>

      <title>CO2-induced Drastic Decharging of Dielectric Surfaces in Aqueous Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of airborne CO2 on the charge state of carboxylate stabilized polymer latex particles suspended in aqueous electrolytes. We combine conductometric experiments interpreted in terms of Hessinger's conductivity model with Poisson-Boltzmann cell (PBC) model calculations with charge regulation boundary conditions. Without CO2, a minority of the weakly acidic surface groups are dissociated and only a fraction of the total number of counter-ions actually contribute to conductivity. The remaining counter-ions exchange freely with added other ions like Na+, K+ or Cs+. From the PBC-calculations we infer a corresponding pKa of 4.26 as well as a renormalized charge in reasonably good agreement with the number of freely mobile counter-ions. Equilibration of salt- and CO2-free suspensions against ambient air leads to a drastic de-charging, which exceeds by far the expected effects of to dissolved CO2 and its dissociation products. Further, no counter-ion-exchange is observed. To reproduce the experimental findings, we have to assume an effective pKa of 6.48. This direct influence of CO2 on the state of surface group dissociation explains our recent finding of a CO2-induced decrease of the {\zeta}-potential and supports the suggestion of an additional charge regulation caused by molecular CO2. Given the importance of charged surfaces in contact with aqueous electrolytes, we anticipate that our observations bear substantial theoretical challenges and important implications for applications ranging from desalination to bio-membranes.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of polymers: A simple matter where complexity matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity coefficient $\kappa$ measures the ability of a material to conduct a heat current. In particular, $\kappa$ is an important property that often dictates the usefulness of a material over a wide range of environmental conditions. For example, while a low $\kappa$ is desirable for the thermoelectric applications, a large $\kappa$ is needed when a material is used under the high temperature conditions. These materials range from common crystals to commodity amorphous polymers. The latter is of particular importance because of their use in designing light weight high performance functional materials. In this context, however, one of the major limitations of the amorphous polymers is their low $\kappa$, reaching a maximum value of about 0.4 W/Km that is 2--3 orders of magnitude smaller than the standard crystals. Moreover, when energy is predominantly transferred through the bonded connections, $\kappa \ge 100$ W/Km. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to attain a tunability in $\kappa$ via macromolecular engineering. In this work, an overview of the recent results on the $\kappa$ behavior in polymers and polymeric solids is presented. In particular, computational and theoretical results are discussed within the context of complimentary experiments. Future directions are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Curvature dependent dynamics of a bacterium confined in a giant unilamellar vesicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the positional behavior of a single bacterium confined within a vesicle by measuring the probability of locating the bacterium at a certain distance from the vesicle boundary. We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.</description>

      <title>Critical transition between intensive and extensive active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulsions ripen with an average droplet size increasing in time. In chemically active emulsions, coarsening can be absent, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with mono-disperse droplet sizes. By considering a minimal model for phase separation and chemical reactions maintained away from equilibrium, we show that there is a critical transition in the conserved quantity between two classes of chemically active droplets: intensive and extensive ones. Single intensive active droplets reach a stationary size mainly controlled by the reaction-diffusion length scales. Intensive droplets in an emulsion interact only weakly, and the stationary size of a single droplet approximately sets the size of each droplet. On the contrary, the size of a single extensive active droplet scales with the system size, similar to passive phases. In an emulsion of many extensive droplets, their sizes become stationary only due to interactions among them. We discuss how the critical transition between intensive and extensive active droplets affects shape instabilities, including the division of active droplets, paving the way for the observation of successive division events in chemically active emulsions</description>

      <title>Elephant trunk wrinkles: A mathematical model of function and form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of the elephant trunk is the pronounced wrinkling that enables its great flexibility. Here, we devise a general mathematical model that accounts for characteristic skin wrinkles formed during morphogenesis in elephant trunk. Using physically realistic parameters and operating within the theoretical framework of nonlinear morphoelasticity, we elucidate analytically and numerically the effect of skin thickness, relative stiffness and differential growth on the physiological pattern of transverse wrinkles distributed along the trunk. We conclude that, since the skin and muscle components have similar material properties, geometric parameters, such as curvature, play important roles. In particular, our model predicts that, in the proximal region close to the skull, where curvature is lower, fewer wrinkles form and sooner than in the distal narrower region where more wrinkles develop. Similarly, less wrinkling is found on the ventral side, which is flatter, compared to the dorsal side. In summary, the mechanical compatibility between the skin and the muscle enables them to grow seamlessly, while the wrinkled skin acts as a protective barrier that is both thicker and more flexible than the unwrinkled skin.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Enumeration of Flat-Foldings : Study on Random Single Vertex Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with themes such as approximate counting/evaluation of the total number of flat-foldings for random origami diagrams, evaluation of the values averaged over various instances, obtaining forcing sets for general origami diagrams, and evaluation of average computational complexity. An approach to the above problems using a physical model and an efficient size reduction method for them is proposed. Using a statistical mechanics model and a numerical method of approximate enumeration based on it, we give the result of approximate enumeration of the total number of flat-foldings of single-vertex origami diagram with random width of angles gathering around the central vertex, and obtain its size dependence for an asymptotic prediction towards the limit of infinite size. In addition, an outlook with respect to the chained determination of local stacking orders of facets caused by the constraint that prohibits the penetration of them is also provided from the viewpoint of organizing the terms included in the physical model. A method to efficiently solve the problem of the determination or enumeration of flat-foldings is discussed based on the above perspectives. This is thought to be closely related to forcing sets.</description>

      <title>Structural investigation of the liquid crystalline phases of three homologues from the nOS5 series (n = 9, 10, 11) by X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry are used to determine the phase sequence of three liquid crystalline 4-pentylphenyl-4'-n-alkyloxythiobenzoates with n = 9, 10, 11. The X-ray diffraction method is applied for structural characterization of the liquid crystalline phases. The smectic layer spacing, tilt angle, average distance between the long axes of molecules and correlation length of the short-range order are determined as a function of temperature. For the crystal-like smectic phases with the hexagonal or herring-bone packing, the unit cell parameters are obtained. The presence of the tilted hexagonal phase for n = 10, 11 and tilted herring-bone phase for n = 9, 10 is indicated, although the direction of the tilt cannot be determined.</description>

      <title>Large cluster formation in a simple model for globular colloidal aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple model of fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a simplistic representation of membraneless organelles or a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach cluster glassy phases whereas the clusters itself are liquid droplets. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials.</description>

      <title>Fully-Polarized Topological Isostatic Metamaterials in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological surface states are unique to topological materials and are immune to disturbances. In isostatic lattices, mechanical topological floppy modes exhibit softness depending on the polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in three dimensions, the polarization of topological floppy modes is disrupted by the ubiquitous mechanical Weyl lines. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases free of Weyl lines. Floppy modes emerge exclusively on a particular surface of the three-dimensional isostatic structure, leading to the strongly asymmetric stiffness between opposing boundaries. Additionally, uniform soft strains can reversibly shift the lattice configuration to Weyl phases, reducing the stiffness contrast to a trivially comparable level. Our work demonstrates the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases in three dimensions, and paves the way towards engineering soft and adaptive metamaterials.</description>
