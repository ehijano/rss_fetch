      <title>Horoboundary and rigidity of filling geodesic currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We endow the space of projective filling geodesic currents on a closed hyperbolic surface with a natural asymmetric metric extending Thurston's asymmetric metric on Teichm\"uller space, as well as analogous metrics arising from Hitchin representations. More generally, we show that this metric extends beyond surface groups and geodesic currents, and encompasses metrics associated with Anosov representations of Gromov hyperbolic groups. We identify the horofunction compactification of the space of projective filling currents equipped with this metric with the space of projective geodesic currents. As a consequence, we obtain a rigidity result: the metric spaces of projective filling geodesic currents associated with closed surfaces of distinct genera are not isometric.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the Jones polynomial of general link diagrams is known to be $\#$P-hard, while restricting the computation to braid closures on fixed number of strands allows for a polynomial time algorithm. We investigate polynomial time algorithms for Khovanov homology of braids and show that for $3$-braids there is one. In contrast, we show that Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm runs in exponential time when restricted to simple classes of $3$-braids. For more general braids, we obtain that a variation of the scanning algorithm computes the Khovanov homology for a bounded set of homological degrees in polynomial time. We also prove upper and lower bounds on the ranks of Khovanov homology groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using instanton theory, we prove that the boundaries of the corks introduced by Auckly, Kim, Melvin, and Ruberman in [AKMR14] are strong corks, and that any nontrivial linear combination of them also yields a strong cork. Furthermore, via Heegaard Floer theory, we show that they are strong corks with respect to a distinct involution, and we construct a larger family of strong corks that generalizes them. We also prove that the boundaries of the corks introduced by Tange [Tan16] are strong corks and that any nontrivial linear combination of them yields a strong cork.</description>

Abstract: We study the crossing matrix of a braid and introduce a polynomial invariant for braid systems that is invariant under Hurwitz equivalence. As an application to the study of surface braids and surface links, we also define an invariant that can be used as an indicator of the necessity of Euler fusion or fission between braid systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Stature in Graphs of Cube Complexes with Cyclonormal Edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact cube complex $X$ that splits as a graph of virtually special cube complexes. Suppose that the fundamental groups of edge spaces are cyclonormal in the fundamental groups of adjacent vertex spaces. We show that $\pi_1X$ has finite stature with respect to vertex groups in the sense of Huang-Wise. In particular, when vertex groups are hyperbolic, this allows us to deduce virtual specialness of $X$.</description>

      <title>Completeness of closed Kleinian flat Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds of Signature (2,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ denote the model space of flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(2,2)$. We prove that the only domain divisible by a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ is $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ itself. In the Kleinian setting, this provides the first completeness theorem of closed flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds beyond the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases.
  Along the proof, we show two results of independent interest. The first is a geometric reduction for certain divisible domains of affine space. The second concerns the existence of syndetic hulls in semidirect products $R \ltimes G$, where $G$ is a homothety Lie group. This construction generalizes earlier constructions in affine geometry due to Carri\`ere and Dal'bo.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\Gamma_0(2^n)$ ($n\ge2$) has a Farey sequence $\{e_i\}$ such that $e_i \le 2^{n-1}$ for all $e_i$. The above upper bound is optimal, and there exists a unique $j$ such that $e_j= 2^{n-1} $. For each $e_i$, there exists a unique $a_i$ such that $\{ a_i/e_i\}\cup \{\infty\}$ is the set of ideal vertices of a fundamental domain of $\Gamma_0(2^n)$ whose side-pairings give a set of independent generators of $\Gamma_0(2^n)$.</description>

      <title>The Shadow of Vietoris--Rips Complexes in Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vietoris-Rips complex, denoted $R_\beta(X)$, of a metric space $(X,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex where each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $X$ within diameter $\beta$. For any abstract simplicial complex $K$ with the vertex set $K^{(0)}$ a Euclidean subset, its shadow, denoted $S(K)$, is the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. This article centers on the homotopy properties of the shadow of Vietoris-Rips complexes $K=R_\beta(X)$ with vertices from $\mathbb{R}^N$, along with the canonical projection map $ p\colon R_\beta (X) \to S(R_\beta(X))$. The study of the geometric/topological behavior of $p$ is a natural yet non-trivial problem. The map $p$ may have many ``singularities'', which have been partially resolved only in low dimensions $N\leq 3$. The obstacle naturally leads us to study systems of these complexes $\{S(R_{\beta}(S)) \mid \beta &gt; 0, S\subset X\}$. We address the challenge posed by singularities in the shadow projection map by studying systems of the shadow complex using inverse system techniques from shape theory, showing that the limit map exhibits favorable homotopy-theoretic properties. More specifically, leveraging ideas and frameworks from Shape Theory, we show that in the limit ``$\beta \to 0$ and $S \to X$'', the limit map ``$\lim p$'' behaves well with respect to homotopy/homology groups when $X$ is an ANR (Absolute Neighborhood Retract) and admits a metric that satisfies some regularity conditions. This results in limit theorems concerning the homotopy properties of systems of these complexes as the proximity scale parameter approaches zero and the sample set approaches the underlying space (e.g., a submanifold or Euclidean graph). The paper concludes by discussing the potential of these results for finite reconstruction problems in one-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

      <title>An enumerative min-max theorem for minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an enumerative min-max theorem that relates the number of genus g minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds of positive Ricci curvature to topological properties of the set of embedded surfaces of genus $\leq g$, possibly with finitely many singularities. This completes a central component of our program of using topological methods to enumerating minimal surfaces with prescribed genus.
  As an application, we show that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains at least 4 embedded minimal surfaces of genus 2.</description>

Abstract: In the following short note, we give a new geometric interpretation of the generator of the infinite cyclic group $H^1(\text{Mod}(S_{g,1});H^1(S_g;\mathbb{Z}))$ (this computation is proved by Morita). There are several constructions of this class given by Earle, Morita, Trapp and Furuta. The construction we give here uses the action of $\text{Mod}(S_{g,1})$ on the circle and its rotation numbers. We also show that our construction is the same as the construction by Furuta and Trapp using winding numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a specific line arrangement obtained from a generic $2$-section of the braid arrangement, and compute the fundamental group of its complement via braid monodromy. We show that the resulting presentation of the fundamental group coincides, under the identification of generators, with the modified Artin presentation introduced by Margalit and McCammond. Moreover, we extend the construction to the Manin--Schechtman arrangements $MS(n, k)$, which are higher analogues of the braid arrangement. Focusing on the case $k = 2$, we obtain an explicit presentation of $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}^n \setminus MS(n, 2))$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94].
  A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the mutations of coefficients. In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra.
  We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichm\"uller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation. The irreducible intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07], and we give a partial evidence.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a locally standard $T$-pseudomanifold, a class that generalizes both complete toric varieties and locally standard $T$-manifolds. The main goal of this paper is to show that locally standard $T$-pseudomanifolds over topological stratified pseudomanifolds satisfying certain conditions are completely classified, up to (weakly) equivariant homeomorphism, by their characteristic data. This result extends the classification of quasitoric manifolds by Davis-Januszkiewicz. (v2: proof of Proposition 14.4 updated, several typos corrected)</description>

Abstract: We partially resolve conjectures of Deligne and Simpson concerning $\mathbb{Z}$-local systems on quasi-projective varieties that underlie a polarized variation of Hodge structure. For local systems with $\mathbb{Q}$-anisotropic monodromy, we prove (1) a relative form of Deligne's finiteness theorem, for any family of quasi-projective varieties, and (2) algebraicity of the corresponding non-abelian Hodge locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the base space of a homotopy cofibration is locally hyperbolic under various conditions. In particular, if these manifolds admit a rationally elliptic closure, then almost all punctured manifolds and almost all manifolds with rationally spherical boundary are $\mathbb{Z}/p^r$-hyperbolic for almost all primes $p$ and all integers $r \geq 1$, and satisfy Moore's conjecture at sufficiently large primes.</description>

      <title>On Fico's Lemmata and the Homotopy Type of Certain Gyrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake to determine the homotopy type of gyrations of sphere products and of connected sums, thereby generalising results known in earlier literature as ''Fico's Lemmata'' which underpin gyrations in their original formulation from geometric topology. We provide applications arising from recasting these results into the modern homotopy theoretic setting.</description>

      <title>Min-max theory and minimal surfaces with prescribed genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a general min-max type theorem that produces minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. An important intermediate step is to show that, in a generic metric with positive Ricci curvature, any family of smooth embedded surfaces, possibly with finitely many singularities, can be deformed into a certain ``topologically optimal family".
  Results in this paper will be crucial to our program on the construction of multiple minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-spheres via topological methods.</description>

      <title>On The Topology of Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is an introductory and informal exposition on the topology of polygonal meshes. We begin with a broad overview of topological notions and discuss how homeomorphisms, homotopy, and homology can be used to characterise topology. We move on to define polygonal meshes and make a distinction between intrinsic topology and extrinsic topology which depends on the space in which the mesh is immersed. A distinction is also made between quantitative topological properties and qualitative properties. Next, we outline proofs of the Euler and the Euler-Poincar\'e formulas. The Betti numbers are then defined in terms of the Euler-Poincar\'e formula and other mesh statistics rather than as cardinalities of the homology groups which allows us to avoid abstract algebra. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to cut a polygonal mesh such that it becomes a topological disc.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov Reeb flows and contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a pseudo-Anosov contact structure, which admits a type of singular contact form with pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow. We prove that contact homology detects the free homotopy classes of closed orbits of any pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow and that any pseudo-Anosov contact structure is universally tight and torsion free. Many applications are given, including new cases of the Finiteness Conjecture for transitive pseudo-Anosov flows. Our proofs use a flavor of contact homology graded by a free homotopy class of loops, defined for any contact manifold. We establish several properties of this type of contact homology that may be of independent interest.</description>
