      <title>Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</description>

      <title>Testing for racial bias using inconsistent perceptions of race</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests for racial bias commonly assess whether two people of different races are treated differently. A fundamental challenge is that, because two people may differ in many ways, factors besides race might explain differences in treatment. Here, we propose a test for bias which circumvents the difficulty of comparing two people by instead assessing whether the $\textit{same person}$ is treated differently when their race is perceived differently. We apply our method to test for bias in police traffic stops, finding that the same driver is likelier to be searched or arrested by police when they are perceived as Hispanic than when they are perceived as white. Our test is broadly applicable to other datasets where race, gender, or other identity data are perceived rather than self-reported, and the same person is observed multiple times.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Connected Vehicle Data for Near-Crash Detection and Analysis in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic safety is a pressing concern in modern transportation systems, especially in rapidly growing metropolitan areas where increased traffic congestion, complex road networks, and diverse driving behaviors exacerbate the risk of traffic incidents. Traditional traffic crash data analysis offers valuable insights but often overlooks a broader range of road safety risks. Near-crash events, which occur more frequently and signal potential collisions, provide a more comprehensive perspective on traffic safety. However, city-scale analysis of near-crash events remains limited due to the significant challenges in large-scale real-world data collection, processing, and analysis. This study utilizes one month of connected vehicle data, comprising billions of records, to detect and analyze near-crash events across the road network in the City of San Antonio, Texas. We propose an efficient framework integrating spatial-temporal buffering and heading algorithms to accurately identify and map near-crash events. A binary logistic regression model is employed to assess the influence of road geometry, traffic volume, and vehicle types on near-crash risks. Additionally, we examine spatial and temporal patterns, including variations by time of day, day of the week, and road category. The findings of this study show that the vehicles on more than half of road segments will be involved in at least one near-crash event. In addition, more than 50% near-crash events involved vehicles traveling at speeds over 57.98 mph, and many occurred at short distances between vehicles. The analysis also found that wider roadbeds and multiple lanes reduced near-crash risks, while single-unit trucks slightly increased the likelihood of near-crash events. Finally, the spatial-temporal analysis revealed that near-crash risks were most prominent during weekday peak hours, especially in downtown areas.</description>

      <title>An AFM-based approach for quantification of guest particle deformation during mechano-fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the mechano-fusion process for dry particle coating, (hetero)-aggregates are formed consisting of host particles which are coated by smaller guest particles. During this process, the latter are exposed to intense particle-particle interactions and particle-wall impacts, which lead to deformation of the guest particles original shape. These deformations on the nano- and microscale can heavily influence the effective macroscopic properties of the resutling coated particles. We present a method to quantify the shape deformation of guest particles during mechano-fusion based on measurements acquired by atomic force microscopy before and after mechano-fusion. To this end, we reconstruct the 3D shape of guest particles by means of an ellipsoidal fit, constrained by the known volume of the guest particles. Using these reconstructed shapes, we can quantify the degree of deformation by comparing the aspect ratios of the ellipsoidal fits before and after mechano-fusion. Such a quantification enhances the understanding of how process-related parameters influence the geometric descriptors of the involved particles, which in turn impact the overall macroscopic properties of the material.</description>

      <title>BMRMM: An R Package for Bayesian Markov (Renewal) Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the BMRMM package implementing Bayesian inference for a class of Markov renewal mixed models which can characterize the stochastic dynamics of a collection of sequences, each comprising alternative instances of categorical states and associated continuous duration times, while being influenced by a set of exogenous factors as well as a 'random' individual. The default setting flexibly models the state transition probabilities using mixtures of Dirichlet distributions and the duration times using mixtures of gamma kernels while also allowing variable selection for both. Modeling such data using simpler Markov mixed models also remains an option, either by ignoring the duration times altogether or by replacing them with instances of an additional category obtained by discretizing them by a user-specified unit. The option is also useful when data on duration times may not be available in the first place. We demonstrate the package's utility using two data sets.</description>

      <title>Latent mixed-effect models for high-dimensional longitudinal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling longitudinal data is an important yet challenging task. These datasets can be high-dimensional, contain non-linear effects and time-varying covariates. Gaussian process (GP) prior-based variational autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a promising approach due to their ability to model time-series data. However, they are costly to train and struggle to fully exploit the rich covariates characteristic of longitudinal data, making them difficult for practitioners to use effectively. In this work, we leverage linear mixed models (LMMs) and amortized variational inference to provide conditional priors for VAEs, and propose LMM-VAE, a scalable, interpretable and identifiable model. We highlight theoretical connections between it and GP-based techniques, providing a unified framework for this class of methods. Our proposal performs competitively compared to existing approaches across simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <title>Performance of Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Advanced methods for causal inference, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), require certain conditions for statistical inference. However, in situations where there is not differentiability due to data sparsity or near-positivity violations, the Donsker class condition is violated. In such situations, TMLE variance can suffer from inflation of the type I error and poor coverage, leading to conservative confidence intervals. Cross-validation of the TMLE algorithm (CVTMLE) has been suggested to improve on performance compared to TMLE in settings of positivity or Donsker class violations. We aim to investigate the performance of CVTMLE compared to TMLE in various settings.
  Methods: We utilised the data-generating mechanism as described in Leger et al. (2022) to run a Monte Carlo experiment under different Donsker class violations. Then, we evaluated the respective statistical performances of TMLE and CVTMLE with different super learner libraries, with and without regression tree methods.
  Results: We found that CVTMLE vastly improves confidence interval coverage without adversely affecting bias, particularly in settings with small sample sizes and near-positivity violations. Furthermore, incorporating regression trees using standard TMLE with ensemble super learner-based initial estimates increases bias and variance leading to invalid statistical inference.
  Conclusions: It has been shown that when using CVTMLE the Donsker class condition is no longer necessary to obtain valid statistical inference when using regression trees and under either data sparsity or near-positivity violations. We show through simulations that CVTMLE is much less sensitive to the choice of the super learner library and thereby provides better estimation and inference in cases where the super learner library uses more flexible candidates and is prone to overfitting.</description>

      <title>Zipf's law in the distribution of Brazilian firm size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zipf's law states that the probability of a variable being larger than $s$ is roughly inversely proportional to $s$. In this paper, we evaluate Zipf's law for the distribution of firm size by the number of employees in Brazil. We use publicly available binned annual data from the Central Register of Enterprises (CEMPRE), which is held by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and covers all formal organizations. Remarkably, we find that Zipf's law provides a very good, although not perfect, approximation to data for each year between 1996 and 2020 at the economy-wide level and also for agriculture, industry, and services alone. However, a lognormal distribution also performs well and even outperforms Zipf's law in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Statistical Jump Model for Mixed-Type Data with Missing Data Imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of clustering mixed-type data with temporal evolution by introducing the statistical jump model for mixed-type data. This novel framework incorporates regime persistence, enhancing interpretability and reducing the frequency of state switches, and efficiently handles missing data. The model is easily interpretable through its state-conditional means and modes, making it accessible to practitioners and policymakers. We validate our approach through extensive simulation studies and an empirical application to air quality data, demonstrating its superiority in inferring persistent air quality regimes compared to the traditional air quality index. Our contributions include a robust method for mixed-type temporal clustering, effective missing data management, and practical insights for environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks with LSTM and GRU in Modeling Active Fires in the Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting the historical time series of active fire spots detected by the AQUA\_M-T satellite in the Amazon, Brazil. The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.
