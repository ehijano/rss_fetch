      <title>Vanishing Signatures, Orbit Closure, and the Converse of the Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valiant's Holant theorem is a powerful tool for algorithms and reductions for counting problems. It states that if two sets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of tensors (a.k.a. constraint functions or signatures) are related by a \emph{holographic transformation}, then $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are \emph{Holant-indistinguishable}, i.e., every tensor network using tensors from $\mathcal{F}$, resp. from $\mathcal{G}$, contracts to the same value. Xia (ICALP 2010) conjectured the converse of the Holant theorem, but a counterexample was found based on \emph{vanishing} signatures, those which are Holant-indistinguishable from 0.
  We prove two near-converses of the Holant theorem using techniques from invariant theory. (I) Holant-indistinguishable $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ always admit two sequences of holographic transformations mapping them arbitrarily close to each other, i.e., their $\text{GL}_q$-orbit closures intersect. (II) We show that vanishing signatures are the only true obstacle to a converse of the Holant theorem. As corollaries of the two theorems we obtain the first characterization of homomorphism-indistinguishability over graphs of bounded degree, a long standing open problem, and show that two graphs with invertible adjacency matrices are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism-indistinguishable over graphs with maximum degree at most three. We also show that Holant-indistinguishability is complete for a complexity class \textbf{TOCI} introduced by Lysikov and Walter, and hence hard for graph isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Agglomeration based influential node ranking in path-type networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of vital nodes contributes to the research of network robustness and vulnerability. The most influential nodes are effective in maximizing the speed and accelerating the information propagation in complex networks. Identifying and ranking the most influential nodes in complex networks has not only theoretical but also practical significance in network analysis since these nodes have a critical influence on the structure and function of complex networks. This paper is devoted to the evaluating the importance of nodes and ranking influential nodes in paths and path-type networks such as comets, double comets, and lollipop networks by network agglomeration based node contraction method.</description>

      <title>On Closure Properties of Read-Once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the closure properties of read-once oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (roABPs) under various natural algebraic operations and prove the following.
  - Non-closure under factoring: There is a sequence of explicit polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ that have $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that some irreducible factor of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of superpolynomial size in any order.
  - Non-closure under powering: There is a sequence of polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ with $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that any super-constant power of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of polynomial size in any order (and $f_n^n$ requires exponential size in any order).
  - Non-closure under symmetric compositions: There are symmetric polynomials $(f_n(e_1,\ldots, e_n))_n$ that have roABPs of polynomial size such that $f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ do not have roABPs of subexponential size. (Here, $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.)
  These results should be viewed in light of known results on models such as algebraic circuits, (general) algebraic branching programs, formulas and constant-depth circuits, all of which are known to be closed under these operations.
  To prove non-closure under factoring, we construct hard polynomials based on expander graphs using gadgets that lift their hardness from sparse polynomials to roABPs. For symmetric compositions, we show that the circulant polynomial requires roABPs of exponential size in every variable order.</description>

      <title>Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. I. Algorithmic and geometric foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those with mixed splitting rules.</description>

      <title>Statistical Model Checking Beyond Means: Quantiles, CVaR, and the DKW Inequality (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical model checking (SMC) randomly samples probabilistic models to approximate quantities of interest with statistical error guarantees. It is traditionally used to estimate probabilities and expected rewards, i.e. means of different random variables on paths. In this paper, we develop methods using the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Massart inequality (DKW) to extend SMC beyond means to compute quantities such as quantiles, conditional value-at-risk, and entropic risk. The DKW provides confidence bounds on the random variable's entire cumulative distribution function, a much more versatile guarantee compared to the statistical methods prevalent in SMC today. We have implemented support for computing new quantities via the DKW in the 'modes' simulator of the Modest Toolset. We highlight the implementation and its versatility on benchmarks from the quantitative verification literature.</description>

      <title>Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</description>

      <title>Finding happiness by evolutionary algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$, a $\rho$-happy vertex $v$ in a coloured graph shares a colour with at least $\rho\mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours. Soft happy colouring of a graph $G$ with $k$ colours extends a partial $k$-colouring to a complete vertex $k$-colouring such that the number of $\rho$-happy vertices is maximum among all such colouring extensions. The problem is known to be NP-hard, and an optimal solution has a direct relation with the community structure of the graph. In addition, some heuristics and local search algorithms, such as Local Maximal Colouring (LMC) and Local Search (LS), have already been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we design Genetic and Memetic Algorithms for soft happy colouring and test them for a large set of randomly generated partially coloured graphs. Memetic algorithms yield a higher number of $\rho$-happy vertices, but Genetic Algorithms can perform well only when their initial populations are generated by LMC or LS. Statistically significant results indicate that both Genetic and Memetic Algorithms achieve high average accuracy in community detection when their initial populations are generated using LMC. Moreover, among the competing methods, the memetic algorithm whose initial population is generated by LMC identified the greatest number of complete solutions.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>Ryser's Theorem for Symmetric $\rho$-latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be an $n\times n$ array whose top left $r\times r$ subarray is filled with $k$ different symbols, each occurring at most once in each row and at most once in each column. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure the remaining cells of $L$ can be filled such that each symbol occurs at most once in each row and at most once in each column, $L$ is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, and each symbol occurs a prescribed number of times in $L$. The case where the prescribed number of times each symbol occurs is $n$ was solved by Cruse (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 16 (1974), 18--22), and the case where the top left subarray is $r\times n$ and the symmetry is not required, was settled by Goldwasser et al. (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 130 (2015), 26--41). Our result allows the entries of the main diagonal to be specified as well, which leads to an extension of the Andersen-Hoffman Theorem (Annals of Disc. Math. 15 (1982) 9--26, European J. Combin. 4 (1983) 33--35).</description>

      <title>On the Multi-Robber Damage Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Cops and Robbers game on graphs in which the robbers damage the visited vertices, aiming to maximize the number of damaged vertices. For that game with one cop against $s$ robbers a conjecture was made by Carlson, Halloran and Reinhart that the cop can save three vertices from being damaged as soon as the maximum degree of the base graph is at least $\binom{s}{2} + 2$.
  We are able to verify the conjecture and prove that it is tight once we add the assumption that the base graph is triangle free. We also study the game without that assumption, disproving the conjecture in full generality and further attempting to locate the smallest maximum degree of a base graph which guarantees that the cop can save three vertices against $s$ robbers. We show that this number is between $2\binom{s}{2} - 3$ and $2\binom{s}{2} + 1$.
  Furthermore, after the game has been previously studied with one cop and multiple robbers, as well as with one robber and multiple cops, we initiate the study of the game with two cops and two robbers. In the case when the base graph is a cycle we determine the exact number of damaged vertices. Additionally, when the base graph is a path we provide bounds that differ by an additive constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present parity conditions under which a toy rail network is one-way, i.e., whether a direction can be assigned across the network so that all train journeys are completely consistent with it or completely consistent with its opposite. We show that this problem is equivalent to determining the balance of a signed graph obtained from the network, whose edges are assigned positive or negative signs. Using signed-graph theory, we derive two equivalent parity conditions for one-wayness: (i) every cycle must contain an even number of edges that join the same sides of switches, and (ii) every cycle must contain an even number of angles at switches. Signed-graph theory also offers an analytical criterion: A connected network is one-way if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian matrix is zero, suggesting a computational tool for evaluating one-wayness.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Closed curve covering and multiagent TSP ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How efficiently can a closed curve of unit length in $\mathbb{R}^d$ be covered by $k$ closed curves so as to minimize the maximum length of the $k$ curves? We show that the maximum length is at most $2k^{-1} - \frac{1}{4} k^{-4}$ for all $k\geq 2$ and $d \geq 2$. As a first byproduct, we show that $k$ agents can traverse a Euclidean TSP instance significantly faster than a single agent. We thereby sharpen recent planar results by Berendsohn, Kim, and Kozma (2025) and extend these improvements to all dimensions. As a second byproduct, we obtain a linear time approximation algorithm with ratio $2 - \frac{1}{4} k^{-3}$ for covering any closed polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by $k$ closed curves so that the maximum length of an individual curve is minimized.</description>

Abstract: Extremal graph theory studies the maximum or minimum number of subgraphs isomorphic to a prescribed graph under given constraints. \textit{Localization} has recently emerged as a framework that refines such problems by assigning extremal quantities locally (to vertices or edges) and then aggregating them. This perspective not only recovers classical results but also leads to sharper bounds.
  A classical result states that a connected planar graph with a finite girth $g$ satisfies \begin{equation*}
  m \leq \frac{g}{g-2}(n-2) \end{equation*} Wood~\cite{wood} derived upper bounds on the number of $K_t$-cliques in graphs of bounded maximum degree, expressed in terms of both the number of vertices and the number of edges: \begin{align*}
  ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t} \\ mex(m,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{d+1}{2}}\binom{d+1}{t} \end{align*} More recently, Chakraborty and Chen~\cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established a similar upper bound for graphs with bounded path length: \begin{equation*}
  mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t} \end{equation*}
  In this paper, we employ the localization framework to improve these bounds and provide structural characterizations of the extremal graphs attaining them.</description>
