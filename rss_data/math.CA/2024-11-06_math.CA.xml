      <title>The structure of tiles in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}\times \mathbb{Z}_q$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}\times \mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of tiles in the finite abelian groups \( \mathbb{Z}_{p^n} \times \mathbb{Z}_q \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_{p^n} \times \mathbb{Z}_p \) using the concept of a \( p \)-homogeneous tree, which provides an intuitively visualizable criterion.</description>

      <title>The Cone Restriction: An Old Approach Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approach of Ou and Wang to cone restriction via polynomial partitioning. By restructuring their induction arguments into a recursive algorithm and applying the nested polynomial Wolff axioms, we refine the $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ bounds on cone restriction estimate for $q &lt; p$ in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Schatten properties of commutators and equivalent Sobolev norms on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the Schatten class $S^p$ properties of commutators $[b,T]$ of singular integrals and pointwise multipliers in a general framework of (quasi-)metric measure spaces. This covers, unifies, and extends a range of previous results in different special cases. As in the classical results on $\mathbb R^d$, the characterisation has three parts: (1) For $p&gt;d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is in suitable Besov (or fractional Sobolev) space. (2) For $p\leq d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is constant. (3) For $p=d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^{d,\infty}$ (a weak-type Schatten class) if and only if $b$ is in a first-order Sobolev space. Result (1) is very general and extends to all spaces of homogeneous type as long as there are appropriate singular integrals, while extensions of (2) and (3) are proved for complete doubling metric spaces supporting a suitable Poincar\'e inequality. For the proof of (3), we extend a recent derivative-free characterisation of the Sobolev space $\dot W^{1,p}(\mathbb R^d)$ by R. Frank to the general domains that we consider; this is our second main result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reynolds algebras from Volterra integrals and their free construction by complete shuffle product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces algebraic structures for Volterra integral operators with separable kernels, in the style of differential algebra for derivations and Rota-Baxter algebra for operators with kernels dependent solely on a dummy variable. We demonstrate that these operators satisfy a generalization of the algebraic identity defining the classical Reynolds operator, which is rooted in Reynolds's influential work on fluid mechanics.
  To study Volterra integral operators and their integral equations through this algebraic lens, particularly in providing a general form of these integral equations, we construct free objects in the category of algebras equipped with generalized Reynolds operators and the associated differential operators, termed differential Reynolds algebras. Due to the cyclic nature of the Reynolds identity, the natural rewriting rule derived from it does not terminate. To address this challenge, we develop a completion for the underlying space, where a complete shuffle product is defined for the free objects. We also include examples and applications related to Volterra integral equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near homoclinic orbits to a saddle in four-dimensional systems with a first integral and a discrete symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariant 4-dimensional system of ODEs with a smooth first integral $H$ and a saddle equilibrium state $O$. We assume that there exists a transverse homoclinic orbit $\Gamma$ to $O$ that approaches $O$ along the nonleading directions. Suppose $H(O) = c$. In \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(c)$ was described. In particular, some criteria for the existence of the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of $\Gamma$ were given. In the current paper, we describe the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(h)$ for $h\neq c$ close to $c$. We prove that when $h &lt; c$, there exists a unique saddle periodic orbit in each level set $H^{-1}(h)$, and the forward (resp. backward) orbit of any point off the stable (resp. unstable) invariant manifold of this periodic orbit leaves a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We further show that when $h &gt; c$, the forward and backward orbits of any point in $H^{-1}(h)$ near $\Gamma$ leave a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We also prove analogous results for the scenario where two transverse homoclinics to $O$ (homoclinic figure-eight) exist. The results of this paper, together with \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, give a full description of the dynamics in a small open neighborhood of $\Gamma$ (and a small open neighborhood of a homoclinic figure-eight).</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear functional and integrodifferential Volterra convolution equations: Ces\`aro limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the requirements needed in order to characterise the solution space of perturbed linear integro-differential Volterra convolution equations. We highlight in general how the pointwise behaviour of perturbation functions does not necessarily propagate through to the solution which the classical literature seems to suggest. To illustrate this general idea we show the Ces\`aro mean of the solution can converge even in cases when the Ces\`aro mean of the perturbation function diverges. Furthermore we provide a characterisation of when such convergence takes place and explicitly identify the limit in terms of the problem data. Additionally we prove how all results can also be applied to perturbed linear functional differential equations.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Entropy Condition For The Density Of Angular Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a holomorphic self-map of the unit disc. We show that if $\log (1-\lvert f(z) \rvert)$ is integrable on a sub-arc of the unit circle, $I$, then the set of points where the function f has finite Carath\'eodory angular derivative on I is a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets of finite entropy. Conversely, given a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets, $E$, we construct a holomorphic self-map of the unit disc, $f$, such that the set of points where the function has finite Carath\'eodory angular derivative is equal to $E$ and $\log(1-\lvert f(z) \rvert)$ is integrable on the unit circle. Our main technical tools are the Aleksandrov disintegration Theorem and a characterization of countable unions of Beurling-Carleson sets due to Makarov and Nikolski.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $-\partial_tu + \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on a Lipschitz cylinder $\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).
  We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. We note that answer to this question was not known even in the small Carleson case, that is, when the Carleson norm of coefficients is sufficiently small.
  In the elliptic case the analogous question was only fully resolved recently independently by two groups, with two very different methods: one involving two of the authors and S. Hofmann, the second by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa. Our approach in the parabolic case is motivated by that of the first group, but in the parabolic setting there are significant new challenges.</description>
