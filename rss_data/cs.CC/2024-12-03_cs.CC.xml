      <title>Limit-sure reachability for small memory policies in POMDPs is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard model that arises in several applications in sequential decision making is partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) where a decision-making agent interacts with an uncertain environment. A basic objective in such POMDPs is the reachability objective, where given a target set of states, the goal is to eventually arrive at one of them. The limit-sure problem asks whether reachability can be ensured with probability arbitrarily close to 1. In general, the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs is undecidable. However, in many practical cases the most relevant question is the existence of policies with a small amount of memory. In this work, we study the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs with a fixed amount of memory. We establish that the computational complexity of the problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Complexity of Multi-Objective Ordinal Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems (MUCO) are in general hard to solve, i.e., the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard and the outcome set is intractable. In this paper we explore special cases of MUCO problems that are actually easy, i.e., solvable in polynomial time. More precisely, we show that MUCO problems with up to two ordinal objective functions plus one real-valued objective function are tractable, and that their complete nondominated set can be computed in polynomial time. For MUCO problems with one ordinal and a second ordinal or real-valued objective function we present an even more efficient algorithm that applies a greedy strategy multiple times.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Meta-Theorems for Vertex Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10333v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if $G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii) for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time $2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and $2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.

The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and $2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence of our meta-theorems on $k$ is the best possible. More precisely, we show that it is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time $2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex cover and tree-depth.</description>

      <title>The complexity of knapsack problems in wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.08086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new complexity results for computational problems in certain wreath products of groups and (as an application) for free solvable group. For a finitely generated group we study the so-called power word problem (does a given expression $u_1^{k_1} \ldots u_d^{k_d}$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d$ are words over the group generators and $k_1, \ldots, k_d$ are binary encoded integers, evaluate to the group identity?) and knapsack problem (does a given equation $u_1^{x_1} \ldots u_d^{x_d} = v$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d,v$ are words over the group generators and $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ are variables, has a solution in the natural numbers). We prove that the power word problem for wreath products of the form $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ with $G$ nilpotent and iterated wreath products of free abelian groups belongs to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. As an application of the latter, the power word problem for free solvable groups is in $\mathsf{TC}^0$. On the other hand we show that for wreath products $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a so called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable group (which form a large subclass of non-solvable groups), the power word problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard. For the knapsack problem we show $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness for iterated wreath products of free abelian groups and hence free solvable groups. Moreover, the knapsack problem for every wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is uniformly efficiently non-solvable, is $\Sigma^2_p$-hard.</description>

      <title>Models That Prove Their Own Correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured *on average* over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train *Self-Proving models* that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm $V$ via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over a random input, the model generates a correct output *and* successfully proves its correctness to $V\!$. The *soundness* property of $V$ guarantees that, for *every* input, no model can convince $V$ of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while *all* incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by $V$. We devise a generic method for learning Self-Proving models, and we prove convergence bounds under certain assumptions. The theoretical framework and results are complemented by experiments on an arithmetic capability: computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Our learning method is used to train a Self-Proving transformer that computes the GCD *and* proves the correctness of its answer.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity Bounds for RoPE-based Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the Arithmetic formula evaluation problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical result not only establishes the complexity bound but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Envy-free and Exchange-stable Seat Arrangement Problems on Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Seat Arrangement Problem is a problem of finding a desirable seat arrangement for given preferences of agents and a seat graph that represents a configuration of seats. In this paper, we consider decision problems of determining if an envy-free arrangement exists and an exchange-stable arrangement exists, when a seat graph is an $\ell \times m$ grid graph. When $\ell=1$, the seat graph is a path of length $m$ and both problems have been known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend it and show that both problems are NP-complete for any integer $\ell \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cardinality of Grobner basis under various orderings. We identify a family of polynomials F and a criteria for the monomial orderings such that the reduced Grobner basis is double exponential in cardinality. We also show that the said criteria is satisfied by orderings such as lexicographic, degree lexicographic and weighted orderings.</description>
