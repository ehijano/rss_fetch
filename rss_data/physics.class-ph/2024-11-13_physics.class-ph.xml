      <title>Reconfigurable Acoustic Metalens with Tailored Structural Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to concentrate sound energy with a tunable focal point is essential for a wide range of acoustic applications, offering precise control over the location and intensity of sound pressure maxima. However, conventional acoustic metalenses are typically passive, with fixed focal positions, limiting their versatility. A significant obstacle in achieving tunable sound wave focusing lies in the complexity of precise and programmable adjustments, which often require intricate mechanical or electronic systems. In this study, we present a theoretical and experimental investigation of a reconfigurable acoustic metalens based on a bistable origami design. The metalens comprises eight flexible origami units, each capable of switching between two stable equilibrium states, enabling local modulation of sound waves through two distinct reflection phases. The metalens can be locked into specific symmetric or asymmetric configurations by manually tailoring the origami units to settle either of the two states. Each configuration generates a unique phase profile, focusing sound energy at a specific point. This concept allows the focal spot to be dynamically reconfigured both on and off-axis. Furthermore, the approach introduces a simple yet effective mechanism for tuning sound energy concentration, offering a solution for flexible acoustic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Modified Landauer principle according to Tsallis entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer principle establishes a lower bound in the amount of energy that should be dissipated in the erasure of one bit of information. The specific value of this dissipated energy is tightly related to the definition of entropy. In this article, we present a generalization of the Landauer principle based on the Tsallis entropy. Some consequences resulting from such a generalization are discussed. These consequences include the modification to the mass ascribed to one bit of information, the generalization of the Landauer principle to the case when the system is embedded in a gravitational field, and the number of bits radiated in the emission of gravitational waves.</description>
