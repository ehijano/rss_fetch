      <title>Convex Clustering Redefined: Robust Learning with the Median of Means Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering approaches that utilize convex loss functions have recently attracted growing interest in the formation of compact data clusters. Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters. By leveraging the robustness of MoM alongside the stability of convex clustering, our method enhances both performance and efficiency, especially on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates weak consistency under specific conditions, while experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of the JKO Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\eta&gt;0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\rho_k^\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\eta$. We show that $\rho_k^\eta$ are approximated to order $\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \emph{modified} energy \[ J^{\eta}(\rho) = J(\rho) - \frac{\eta}{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{\delta J}{\delta \rho} (\rho) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,\rho(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\eta$ a \textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{\"a}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\eta$ we study \emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\eta$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.</description>

      <title>Latent space analysis and generalization to out-of-distribution data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships between data points in the latent decision space derived by the deep learning system is critical to evaluating and interpreting the performance of the system on real world data. Detecting \textit{out-of-distribution} (OOD) data for deep learning systems continues to be an active research topic. We investigate the connection between latent space OOD detection and classification accuracy of the model. Using open source simulated and measured Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the OOD detection cannot be used as a proxy measure for model performance. We hope to inspire additional research into the geometric properties of the latent space that may yield future insights into deep learning robustness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Learn Generic Multi-Index Models Near Information-Theoretic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Beyond Uncertainty Sets: Leveraging Optimal Transport to Extend Conformal Predictive Distribution to Multivariate Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) constructs uncertainty sets for model outputs with finite-sample coverage guarantees. A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.</description>

      <title>Particle Monte Carlo methods for Lattice Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional multimodal sampling problems from lattice field theory (LFT) have become important benchmarks for machine learning assisted sampling methods. We show that GPU-accelerated particle methods, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and nested sampling, provide a strong classical baseline that matches or outperforms state-of-the-art neural samplers in sample quality and wall-clock time on standard scalar field theory benchmarks, while also estimating the partition function. Using only a single data-driven covariance for tuning, these methods achieve competitive performance without problem-specific structure, raising the bar for when learned proposals justify their training cost.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Optimisation with Unbounded Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is critically vulnerable to extreme outliers. Existing provably robust methods typically assume a bounded cumulative corruption budget, which makes them defenseless against even a single corruption of sufficient magnitude. To address this, we introduce a new adversary whose budget is only bounded in the frequency of corruptions, not in their magnitude. We then derive RCGP-UCB, an algorithm coupling the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) approach with a Robust Conjugate Gaussian Process (RCGP). We present stable and adaptive versions of RCGP-UCB, and prove that they achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to $O(T^{1/2})$ and $O(T^{1/3})$ corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude. This robustness comes at near zero cost: without outliers, RCGP-UCB's regret bounds match those of the standard GP-UCB algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lasso: robust sparse penalization under heavy-tailed noise and outliers with exponential-type loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.
  Our method is implemented in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{heavylasso} available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso</description>

      <title>Gini Score under Ties and Case Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gini score is a popular tool in statistical modeling and machine learning for model validation and model selection. It is a purely rank based score that allows one to assess risk rankings. The Gini score for statistical modeling has mainly been used in a binary context, in which it has many equivalent reformulations such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) or the area under the curve (AUC). In the actuarial literature, this rank based score for binary responses has been extended to general real-valued random variables using Lorenz curves and concentration curves. While these initial concepts assume that the risk ranking is generated by a continuous distribution function, we discuss in this paper how the Gini score can be used in the case of ties in the risk ranking. Moreover, we adapt the Gini score to the common actuarial situation of having case weights.</description>

      <title>A Physics Informed Machine Learning Framework for Optimal Sensor Placement and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation remains a challenging task across many areas of engineering. Because data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity. The results demonstrate that our PINNs-based methodology consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to parameter values estimated from intuitively or randomly selected sensor positions.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal delta-convex estimation of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a tractable algorithm for estimating an unknown Lipschitz function from noisy observations and establishes an upper bound on its convergence rate. The approach extends max-affine methods from convex shape-restricted regression to the more general Lipschitz setting. A key component is a nonlinear feature expansion that maps max-affine functions into a subclass of delta-convex functions, which act as universal approximators of Lipschitz functions while preserving their Lipschitz constants. Leveraging this property, the estimator attains the minimax convergence rate (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the intrinsic dimension of the data under squared loss and subgaussian distributions in the random design setting. The algorithm integrates adaptive partitioning to capture intrinsic dimension, a penalty-based regularization mechanism that removes the need to know the true Lipschitz constant, and a two-stage optimization procedure combining a convex initialization with local refinement. The framework is also straightforward to adapt to convex shape-restricted regression. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance relative to other theoretically justified methods, including nearest-neighbor and kernel-based regressors.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Differential Privacy for Heavy-Tailed SDEs via Fractional Poincar\'e Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the differential privacy (DP) of learning algorithms has become a major challenge in recent years. In parallel, many studies suggested investigating the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with heavy-tailed noise, both as a model for modern deep learning models and to improve their performance. However, most DP bounds focus on light-tailed noise, where satisfactory guarantees have been obtained but the proposed techniques do not directly extend to the heavy-tailed setting. Recently, the first DP guarantees for heavy-tailed SGD were obtained. These results provide $(0,\delta)$-DP guarantees without requiring gradient clipping. Despite casting new light on the link between DP and heavy-tailed algorithms, these results have a strong dependence on the number of parameters and cannot be extended to other DP notions like the well-established R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP). In this work, we propose to address these limitations by deriving the first RDP guarantees for heavy-tailed SDEs, as well as their discretized counterparts. Our framework is based on new R\'enyi flow computations and the use of well-established fractional Poincar\'e inequalities. Under the assumption that such inequalities are satisfied, we obtain DP guarantees that have a much weaker dependence on the dimension compared to prior art.</description>

      <title>Front-door Reducibility: Reducing ADMGs to the Standard Front-door Setting via a Graphical Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Front-door adjustment provides a simple closed-form identification formula under the classical front-door criterion, but its applicability is often viewed as narrow and strict. Although ID algorithm is very useful and is proved effective for causal relation identification in general causal graphs (if it is identifiable), performing ID algorithm does not guarantee to obtain a practical, easy-to-estimate interventional distribution expression. We argue that the applicability of the front-door criterion is not as limited as it seems: many more complicated causal graphs can be reduced to the front-door criterion. In this paper, We introduce front-door reducibility (FDR), a graphical condition on acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) that extends the applicability of the classic front-door criterion to reduce a large family of complicated causal graphs to a front-door setting by aggregating variables into super-nodes (FDR triple) $\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{*},\boldsymbol{Y}^{*},\boldsymbol{M}^{*}\right)$. After characterizing FDR criterion, we prove a graph-level equivalence between the satisfication of FDR criterion and the applicability of FDR adjustment. Meanwhile, we then present FDR-TID, an exact algorithm that detects an admissible FDR triple, together with established the algorithm's correctness, completeness, and finite termination. Empirically-motivated examples illustrate that many graphs outside the textbook front-door setting are FDR, yielding simple, estimable adjustments where general ID expressions would be cumbersome. FDR thus complements existing identification method by prioritizing interpretability and computational simplicity without sacrificing generality across mixed graphs.</description>

      <title>BaGGLS: A Bayesian Shrinkage Framework for Interpretable Modeling of Interactions in High-Dimensional Biological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological data sets are often high-dimensional, noisy, and governed by complex interactions among sparse signals. This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns, with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology.</description>

      <title>Sample-Adaptivity Tradeoff in On-Demand Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tradeoff between sample complexity and round complexity in on-demand sampling, where the learning algorithm adaptively samples from $k$ distributions over a limited number of rounds. In the realizable setting of Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL), we show that the optimal sample complexity of an $r$-round algorithm scales approximately as $dk^{\Theta(1/r)} / \epsilon$. For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O((d + k) / \epsilon^2)$ within $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.</description>

      <title>CODE: A global approach to ODE dynamics learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a conventional way to describe the observed dynamics of physical systems. Scientists typically hypothesize about dynamical behavior, propose a mathematical model, and compare its predictions to data. However, modern computing and algorithmic advances now enable purely data-driven learning of governing dynamics directly from observations. In data-driven settings, one learns the ODE's right-hand side (RHS). Dense measurements are often assumed, yet high temporal resolution is typically both cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, one usually has only sparsely sampled data. In this work we introduce ChaosODE (CODE), a Polynomial Chaos ODE Expansion in which we use an arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion (aPCE) for the ODE's right-hand side, resulting in a global orthonormal polynomial representation of dynamics. We evaluate the performance of CODE in several experiments on the Lotka-Volterra system, across varying noise levels, initial conditions, and predictions far into the future, even on previously unseen initial conditions. CODE exhibits remarkable extrapolation capabilities even when evaluated under novel initial conditions and shows advantages compared to well-examined methods using neural networks (NeuralODE) or kernel approximators (KernelODE) as the RHS representer. We observe that the high flexibility of NeuralODE and KernelODE degrades extrapolation capabilities under scarce data and measurement noise. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for robust optimization of dynamics-learning problems and illustrate them in the accompanying code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for analysing the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Drawing on recent advances in the theory of gradient flows over Euclidean-Wasserstein spaces, we extend techniques from alternating minimization in Euclidean spaces to the EM algorithm, via its representation as coordinate-wise minimization of the free energy. In so doing, we obtain finite sample error bounds and exponential convergence of the EM algorithm under a natural generalisation of the log-Sobolev inequality. We further show that this framework naturally extends to several variants of EM, offering a unified approach for studying such algorithms.</description>

      <title>LiLaN: A Linear Latent Network as the Solution Operator for Real-Time Solutions to Stiff Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving stiff ordinary differential equations (StODEs) requires sophisticated numerical solvers, which are often computationally expensive. In general, traditional explicit time integration schemes with restricted time step sizes are not suitable for StODEs, and one must resort to costly implicit methods. On the other hand, state-of-the-art machine learning based methods, such as Neural ODE, poorly handle the timescale separation of various elements of the solutions to StODEs, while still requiring expensive implicit/explicit integration at inference time. In this work, we propose a linear latent network (LiLaN) approach in which the dynamics in the latent space can be integrated analytically, and thus numerical integration is completely avoided. At the heart of LiLaN are the following key ideas: i) two encoder networks to encode the initial condition together with parameters of the ODE to the slope and the initial condition for the latent dynamics, respectively. Since the latent dynamics, by design, are linear, the solution can be evaluated analytically; ii) a neural network to map the physical time to latent times, one for each latent variable. Finally, iii) a decoder network to decode the latent solution to the physical solution at the corresponding physical time. We provide a universal approximation theorem for the proposed LiLaN approach, showing that it can approximate the solution of any stiff nonlinear system on a compact set to any degree of accuracy epsilon. We also show an interesting fact that the dimension of the latent dynamical system in LiLaN is independent of epsilon. Numerical results on the "Robertson Stiff Chemical Kinetics Model," "Plasma Collisional-Radiative Model," and "Allen-Cahn" and "Cahn-Hilliard" PDEs suggest that LiLaN outperformed state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for handling stiff ordinary and partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Fairness-Accuracy Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA) frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of the future via prospective learning with control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning (RL). While powerful, this learning framework is mathematically distinct from supervised learning, which has been the main workhorse for the recent achievements in AI. Moreover, RL typically operates in a stationary environment with episodic resets, limiting its utility to more realistic settings. Here, we extend supervised learning to address learning to control in non-stationary, reset-free environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Learning with Control (PL+C)'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective learning with control, foraging -- which is a canonical task for any mobile agent -- be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that modern RL algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary reset-free environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.</description>

      <title>Distributed Event-Based Learning via ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm both in convex and nonconvex settings and derive accelerated convergence rates for the convex case. We also characterize the effect of communication failures and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to these. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from distributed learning tasks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 35% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD and FedADMM.</description>

      <title>Explaining Time Series Classification Predictions via Causal Attributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the excelling performance of machine learning models, understanding their decisions remains a long-standing goal. Although commonly used attribution methods from explainable AI attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on associational rather than causal relationships. In this study, within the context of time series classification, we introduce a novel model-agnostic attribution method to assess the causal effect of concepts i.e., predefined segments within a time series, on classification outcomes. Our approach compares these causal attributions with closely related associational attributions, both theoretically and empirically. To estimate counterfactual outcomes, we use state-of-the-art diffusion models backed by state space models. We demonstrate the insights gained by our approach for a diverse set of qualitatively different time series classification tasks. Although causal and associational attributions might often share some similarities, in all cases they differ in important details, underscoring the risks associated with drawing causal conclusions from associational data alone. We believe that the proposed approach is also widely applicable in other domains to shed some light on the limits of associational attributions.</description>

      <title>ExDAG: an MIQP Algorithm for Learning DAGs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in causal learning in recent years. Commonly used representations of causal structures, including Bayesian networks and structural equation models (SEM), take the form of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We provide a novel mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation and an associated algorithm that identifies DAGs with a low structural Hamming distance between the identified DAG and the ground truth, under identifiability assumptions. The eventual exact learning is guaranteed by the global convergence of the branch-and-bound-and-cut algorithm, which is utilized. In addition to this, integer programming techniques give us access to the dual bound, which allows for a real time assessment of the quality of solution. Previously, integer programming techniques have been shown to lead to limited scaling in the case of DAG identification due to the super exponential number of constraints, which prevent the formation of cycles. The algorithm proposed circumvents this by selectively generating only the violated constraints using the so-called "lazy" constraints methodology. Our empirical results show that ExDAG outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in terms of structural Hamming distance and $F_1$ score when considering Gaussian noise on medium-sized graphs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gradient Normalization and Clipping for Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Necessity, Sufficiency, and Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient clipping has long been considered essential for ensuring the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. In this paper, we revisit this belief and explore whether gradient normalization can serve as an effective alternative or complement. We prove that, under individual smoothness assumptions, gradient normalization alone is sufficient to guarantee convergence of the nonconvex SGD. Moreover, when combined with clipping, it yields far better rates of convergence under more challenging noise distributions. We provide a unifying theory describing normalization-only, clipping-only, and combined approaches. Moving forward, we investigate existing variance-reduced algorithms, establishing that, in such a setting, normalization alone is sufficient for convergence. Finally, we present an accelerated variant that under second-order smoothness improves convergence. Our results provide theoretical insights and practical guidance for using normalization and clipping in nonconvex optimization with heavy-tailed noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a natural intrinsic extension of ridge regression from Euclidean spaces to general Riemannian manifolds for time-series prediction. Our approach combines Riemannian least-squares fitting via B\'ezier curves, empirical covariance on manifolds, and Mahalanobis distance regularization. A key technical contribution is an explicit formula for the gradient of the objective function using adjoint differentials, enabling efficient numerical optimization via Riemannian gradient descent. We validate our framework through synthetic spherical experiments (achieving significant error reduction over unregularized regression) and hurricane forecasting.</description>

      <title>Joint Registration and Conformal Prediction for Partially Observed Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting missing segments in partially observed functions is challenging due to infinite-dimensionality, complex dependence within and across observations, and irregular noise. These challenges are further exacerbated by the existence of two distinct sources of variation in functional data, termed amplitude (variation along the $y$-axis) and phase (variation along the $x$-axis). While registration can disentangle them from complete functional data, the process is more difficult for partial observations. Thus, existing methods for functional data prediction often ignore phase variation. Furthermore, they rely on strong parametric assumptions, and require either precise model specifications or computationally intensive techniques, such as bootstrapping, to construct prediction intervals. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified registration and prediction approach for partially observed functions under the conformal prediction framework, which separately focuses on the amplitude and phase components. By leveraging split conformal methods, our approach integrates registration and prediction while ensuring exchangeability through carefully constructed predictor-response pairs. Using a neighborhood smoothing algorithm, the framework produces pointwise prediction bands with finite-sample marginal coverage guarantees under weak assumptions. The method is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and suitable for parallelization. Numerical studies and real-world data examples clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A meaningful prediction of functional decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on multi-event survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of the motor neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life. However, due to the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R &lt;= 2) for each of five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking, and breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset (N = 3220) by training five covariate-based survival models to estimate the probability of each event over the 500 days following the baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival distributions (ISDs) for a patient, each providing an interpretable estimate of when that event is likely to occur. The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes in the PRO-ACT dataset. Additionally, our method enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions -- where certain covariates can be changed -- to estimate their effect on the predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little or no impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset ALS, our model predicts significantly shorter time-to-event estimates for loss of speech and swallowing function compared to patients with limb-onset ALS (log-rank p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni-adjusted alpha=0.01). The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>MAP Estimation with Denoisers: Convergence Rates and Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Selective Risk Certification for LLM Outputs via Information-Lift Statistics: PAC-Bayes, Robustness, and Skeleton Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models often produce confident but incorrect outputs, creating a critical need for reliable uncertainty quantification with formal abstention guarantees. We introduce information-lift certificates that compare model probabilities to a skeleton baseline, accumulating evidence through sub-gamma PAC-Bayes bounds that remain valid under heavy-tailed distributions where standard concentration inequalities fail. On eight diverse datasets, our method achieves 77.0\% coverage at 2\% risk, outperforming recent baselines by 10.0 percentage points on average. In high-stakes scenarios, we block 96\% of critical errors compared to 18-31\% for entropy-based methods. While our frequency-based certification does not guarantee severity-weighted safety and depends on skeleton quality, performance degrades gracefully under distributional shifts, making the approach practical for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Overfitting in Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive robust optimization (ARO) extends static robust optimization by allowing decisions to depend on the realized uncertainty - weakly dominating static solutions within the modeled uncertainty set. However, ARO makes previous constraints that were independent of uncertainty now dependent, making it vulnerable to additional infeasibilities when realizations fall outside the uncertainty set. This phenomenon of adaptive policies being brittle is analogous to overfitting in machine learning. To mitigate against this, we propose assigning constraint-specific uncertainty set sizes, with harder constraints given stronger probabilistic guarantees. Interpreted through the overfitting lens, this acts as regularization: tighter guarantees shrink adaptive coefficients to ensure stability, while looser ones preserve useful flexibility. This view motivates a principled approach to designing uncertainty sets that balances robustness and adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.</description>

      <title>From Global to Local Correlation: Geometric Decomposition of Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns, reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into gradient flow cells where outcomes exhibit monotonic
  behavior. Co-monotonicity decomposition utilizes vertex-level coefficients
  that provide context-dependent versions of the classical Pearson correlation:
  these coefficients measure edge-based directional concordance between outcome
  and features, or between feature pairs, defining embeddings of samples into
  association space. These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which
  biclustering identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature
  modules. This extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple
  feature sets. Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian
  posterior sampling providing credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Four-Layer Matrix Factorization under Random Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.</description>

      <title>AdamX: An Adam improvement algorithm based on a novel exponential decay mechanism for the second-order moment estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/mengzhu0308/AdamX.</description>
