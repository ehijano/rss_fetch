      <title>Eliminating beam-induced depolarizing effects in the hydrogen jet target for high-precision proton beam polarimetry at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze beam-induced depolarizing effects in the hydrogen jet target (HJET) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that has been used for absolute hadron beam polarimetry and shall be employed at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC's higher bunch repetition frequencies and shorter bunch durations shift beam harmonics to frequencies that can resonantly drive hyperfine transitions in hydrogen, threatening to depolarize the target atoms. Using frequency-domain analysis of beam harmonics and hyperfine transition frequencies, we establish a photon emission threshold above which beam-induced fields are too weak to cause significant depolarization. For EIC injection (\SI{23.5}{\GeV}) and flattop (\SI{275}{\GeV}), beam-induced depolarization through the bunch structure renders operation at the current RHIC magnetic guide field at the target of $B_0 = \SI{120}{\milli\tesla}$ untenable. Increasing the magnetic guide field at the target to $B_0 \approx \SI{400}{\milli\tesla}$ moves all hyperfine transition frequencies to at least three times the cutoff frequency, ensuring reliable absolute beam polarimetry with the required 1\% precision at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles. The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions. Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA), computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation. This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators, this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both alternatives.</description>

      <title>An Online Data Analysis Framework for Accelerator-Based Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on diagnostic data is of crucial importance to physics experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June 2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with minimal modification.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>
