      <title>Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Campylobacter, a Foodborne Pathogen, and Cost Burden Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness. This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity (PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA, SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.</description>

      <title>ALBATROSS: Cheap Filtration Based Geometry via Stochastic Sub-Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) detects geometric structure in biological data. However, many TDA algorithms are memory intensive and impractical for massive datasets. Here, we introduce a statistical protocol that reduces TDA's memory requirements and gives access to scientists with modest computing resources. We validate this protocol against two empirical datasets, showing that it replicates previous findings with much lower memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the protocol by mapping the topology of functional correlations for the human cortex at high spatial resolution, something that was previously infeasible without this novel approach.</description>

      <title>Randomness with constraints: constructing minimal models for high-dimensional biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biologists and physicists have a rich tradition of modeling living systems with simple models composed of a few interacting components. Despite the remarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely tuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous heterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this biological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we observe are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect biologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how this approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in biological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and beyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints'' paradigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing experimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional biological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for biology.</description>

      <title>T-cell receptor specificity landscape revealed through de novo peptide design</title>

Abstract: T-cells play a key role in adaptive immunity by mounting specific responses against diverse pathogens. An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) mediate an immune response. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T-cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC class I alleles, and to design novel immunogenic peptides for specified TCR-MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based, physics-guided machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, the implicit physical reasoning in HERMES enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR-pMHC binding affinities and T-cell activities across diverse viral epitopes and cancer neoantigens, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR-MHC systems targeting viral and cancer peptides, we demonstrate that our designs -- with up to five substitutions from the native sequence -- activate T-cells at success rates of up to 50%. Lastly, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR-MHC complexes, offering key insights into T-cell specificity in both humans and mice. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, as well as for evaluating TCR specificity, offering a computational framework to inform design of engineered T-cell therapies and vaccines.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>

      <title>Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we attain performance that matches or exceeds the performance of leading MCMC approaches that require numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</description>
