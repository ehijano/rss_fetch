      <title>SoliDualSPHysics: An extension of DualSPHysics for solid mechanics with hyperelasticity, plasticity, and fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SoliDualSPHysics, a novel open-source and GPU-accelerated software that extends DualSPHysics to enable the numerical simulation of hyperelastic, finite-strain plastic, and brittle fracture behavior in deformable solids within a unified smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. The software implements a total Lagrangian formulation for solid mechanics that allows direct application of external loads and boundary conditions, enabling independent solid mechanics simulations. Brittle fracture is modeled through a phase-field approach coupled with SPH, allowing crack initiation, propagation, and branching under dynamic loading without the need for additional criteria or local refinement. The framework also supports user-defined mathematical expressions to prescribe time- and space-dependent quantities, complementing the solid and fracture extensions and enhancing flexibility across existing and future DualSPHysics applications. Leveraging DualSPHysics' native CPU/GPU parallel architecture, the software achieves substantial computational acceleration for large-scale simulations, and the implementation is verified and validated against benchmark numerical problems and experimental data, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and favorable scaling performance. Comprehensive implementation details and user documentation are provided to ensure reproducibility and to support further development by the community. The framework and source code are freely available through a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Efficient Road Renovation Scheduling under Uncertainty using Lower Bound Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban infrastructure degrades over time, necessitating periodic renovation to maintain functionality and safety. When renovation is delayed beyond the infrastructure's remaining lifespan, costly emergency interventions become necessary to prevent failure. Decision makers must therefore balance expected emergency intervention costs against traffic congestion impacts. We formalize this trade-off as a road network maintenance scheduling problem with uncertain deadlines, which presents optimization challenges including computationally expensive evaluation and an exponentially growing solution space. To address these challenges, this paper contributes a hybrid optimization approach combining machine learning with genetic algorithms for large-scale infrastructure renovation scheduling under uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem that explicitly accounts for uncertain infrastructure lifespans through probabilistic failure models. We develop a progressive lower bound evaluation method that integrates machine learning surrogate models with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to improve solution quality by enabling more iterations within fixed computational budgets. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on substantially larger problem instances (76 projects) than previously addressed in the literature, achieving statistically significant improvements across multiple performance metrics by increasing computational efficiency up to 40 times compared to standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Refine Now, Query Fast: A Decoupled Refinement Paradigm for Implicit Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion by Optimized Loss Functions on Relaxed Parameters for Inverse Material Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.</description>

      <title>Discovering the mechanics of ultra-low density elastomeric foams in elite-level racing shoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-low-density elastomeric foams enable lightweight systems that combine high compliance with efficient energy return. In high-performance racing shoes, these foams are critical for low weight, high cushioning, and efficient energy return; yet, their constitutive behavior remains difficult to model and poorly understood. Here we integrate mechanical testing and machine learning to discover the mechanics of two ultra-low density elastomeric polymeric foams used in elite-level racing shoes. Across uniaxial tension, confined and unconfined compression, and simple shear, both foams exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry, negligible lateral strains consistent with an effective Poisson's ratio close to zero, and low hysteresis indicative of an efficient energy return. Both foams provide a similar compressive stiffness (268kPa vs. 299kPa), while one foam exhibits nearly double the shear stiffness (219kPa vs. 117kPa), implying a substantially greater lateral stability at a comparable vertical energy return (83% vs. 89%). By integrating these data into constitutive neural networks, paired with sparse regression, we discover compact, interpretable single-invariant models, supplemented by mixed-invariant or principal-stretch based terms, that capture the unique signature of the foams with R2 values close to one. From a human performance perspective, these models enable finite-element and gait-level simulations of high-performance racing shoes to quantify running economy, performance enhancements, and injury risks on an individual athlete level. More broadly, this work establishes a scalable and interpretable approach for constitutive modeling of highly compressible, ultra-light elastomeric foams with applications to wearable technologies, soft robotics, and energy-efficient mobility systems.</description>

      <title>GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</description>
