      <title>Global semigroup of conservative weak solutions of the two-component Novikov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the two-component Novikov system with initial data $u_0, v_0$ in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ such that the product $(\partial_x u_0)\partial_x v_0$ belongs to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We construct a global semigroup of conservative weak solutions. We also discuss the potential concentration phenomena of $(\partial_x u)^2dx$, $(\partial_x v)^2dx$, and $\left((\partial_x u)^2(\partial_x v)^2\right)dx$, which contribute to wave-breaking and may occur for a set of time with nonzero measure. Finally, we establish the continuity of the data-to-solution map in the uniform norm.</description>

      <title>Viscous Destabilization for Large Shocks of Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent theory of $a-$contraction with shifts provides $L^2$-stability for shock waves of $1-$D hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The theory has been established at the inviscid level uniformly in the shock amplitude, and at the viscous level for small shocks. In this work, we investigate whether the $a-$contraction property holds uniformly in the shock amplitude for some specific systems with viscosity. We show that in some cases, the $a-$contraction fails for sufficiently large shocks. This showcases a "viscous destabilization" effect in the sense that the $a$-contraction property is verified for the inviscid model, but can fail for the viscous one. This also shows that the $a$-contraction property, even among small perturbations, is stronger than the classical notion of nonlinear stability, which is known to hold regardless of shock amplitude for viscous scalar conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity result on a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic system with small perturbations in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quasilinear elliptic system involving a nonhomogeneous differential operator which is introduced by C. A. Stuart [Milan J. Math. 79 (2011), 327-341] and depends on not only $\nabla u$ but also $u$. We show that the existence of multiple small solutions when the nonlinear term $F(x,u,v)$ satisfies locally sublinear and symmetric conditions and the perturbation is any continuous function with a small coefficient and no any growth hypothesis. Our technical approach is mainly based on a variant of Clark's theorem without the global symmetric condition. We develop the Moser's iteration technique to this quasi-linear elliptic system with nonhomogeneous differential operators and obtain that the relationship between $\|u\|_{\infty}$, $\|v\|_{\infty}$ and $\|u\|_{2^{\ast}}$, $\|v\|_{2^{\ast}}$. We overcome some difficulties which are caused by the nonhomogeneity of the differential operator and the lack of compactness of the Sobolev embedding.</description>

      <title>Global existence for small amplitude semilinear wave equations with time-dependent scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharp global existence result for semilinear wave equations with time-dependent scale-invariant damping terms if the initial data is small. More specifically, we consider Cauchy problem of $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $n\ge 3$, $t\ge 1$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. For critical exponent $p_{crit}(n,\mu)$ which is the positive root of $(n+\mu-1)p^2-(n+\mu+1)p-2=0$ and conformal exponent $p_{conf}(n,\mu)=\frac{n+\mu+3}{n+\mu-1}$, we establish global existence for $n\geq3$ and $p_{crit}(n,\mu)&lt;p\leq p_{conf}(n,\mu)$. The proof is based on changing the wave equation into the semilinear generalized Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2u-t^m\Delta u=t^{\alpha(m)}|u|^p$, where $m=m(\mu)&gt;0$ and $\alpha(m)\in\Bbb R$ are two suitable constants, then we investigate more general semilinear Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2v-t^m\Delta v=t^{\alpha}|v|^p$ and establish related weighted Strichartz estimates. Returning to the original wave equation, the corresponding global existence results on the small data solution $u$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in the parameter of the Mittag-Leffler function and determining the fractional exponent of the subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the strict monotonicity in the parameter $\rho$ of the Mittag-Leffler functions $E_\rho(-t^\rho)$ and $t^{\rho -1}E_{\rho,\rho}(-t^\rho)$. Then, these results are applied to solve the inverse problem of determining the order of the fractional derivative in subdiffusion equations, where the available measurement is given at one point in space-time. In particular, we find the missing conditions in the previously known work in this area. Moreover, the obtained results are valid for a wider class of subdiffusion equations than those considered previously. An example of an initial boundary value problem constructed by Sh.A. Alimov is given, for which the inverse problem under consideration has a unique solution. We also point out the application of the monotonicity of the Mittag-Leffler functions to solving some other inverse problems of determining the order of a fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>Global existence for multi-dimensional partially diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the global existence of strong solutions for a class of partially diffusive hyperbolic systems within the framework of critical homogeneous Besov spaces. Our objective is twofold: first, to extend our recent findings on the local existence presented in J.-P. Adogbo and R. Danchin. Local well-posedness in the critical regularity setting for hyperbolic systems with partial diffusion. arXiv:2307.05981, 2024, and second, to refine and enhance the analysis of Kawashima (S. Kawashima. Systems of a hyperbolic parabolic type with applications to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. PhD thesis, Kyoto University, 1983).
  To address the distinct behaviors of low and high frequency regimes, we employ a hybrid Besov norm approach that incorporates different regularity exponents for each regime. This allows us to meticulously analyze the interactions between these regimes, which exhibit fundamentally different dynamics.
  A significant part of our methodology is based on the study of a Lyapunov functional, inspired by the work of Beauchard and Zuazua (K. Beauchard and E. Zuazua. Large time asymptotics for partially dissipative hyperbolic system. Arch. Rational Mech. Anal, 199:177-227, 2011.) and recent contributions (T. Crin-Barat and R. Danchin. Partially dissipative hyperbolic systems in the critical regularity setting: the multi-dimensional case. J. Math. Pures Appl. (9), 165:1-41, 2022). To effectively handle the high-frequency components, we introduce a parabolic mode with better smoothing properties, which plays a central role in our analysis.
  Our results are particularly relevant for important physical systems, such as the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system and the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.</description>

      <title>Recovering nonsmooth coefficients for higher-order perturbations of a polyharmonic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem for a higher order elliptic operator where the principal part is the polyharmonic operator $(-\Delta)^m$ with $ m \geq 2$. We show that the map from the coefficients to a certain bilinear form is injective. We have a particular focus on obtaining these results under lower regularity on the coefficients. It is known that knowledge of this bilinear form is equivalent to a knowledge of a Dirichlet to Neumann map or the Cauchy data for solutions.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for critical points of a nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following nonlocal Soblev-type inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  C_{HLS}\big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\big(|x|^{-\mu} \ast u^{p}\big)u^{p} dx\big)^{\frac{1}{p}}\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|\nabla u|^2 dx , \quad \forall~u\in D^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation*} induced by classical Sobolev inequality and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for $n\geq3$ and $\mu\in(0,n)$, where $p=\frac{2n-\mu}{n-2}$ is energy-critical exponent and $C_{HLS}$ is a dimension $n$ and parameter $\mu$ dependent constant which can be characterized by the following minimization problem $$\frac{1}{C_{HLS}}:=\inf\big\{\|\nabla u\|_{L^2}\big|u\in D^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n),\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\big(|x|^{-\mu} \ast u^{p}\big)u^{p} dx\Big)^{\frac{1}{p}}=1\big\}.$$
  and up to translation and scaling, $W(x)$, which is positive and radially symmetric, is a unique extremal function of the nonlocal Soblev inequality. It is well-known that, up to a suitable scaling,
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u+(|x|^{-\mu}\ast u^{p})u^{p-1}=0 \quad \mbox{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n,
  \end{equation*} which is the Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimization problem. In this paper, we establish the quantitative stability estimates for critical point of the above nonlocal equation for $n\geq6-\mu$ with the parameter region $\mu\in(0,4)$.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Fracture under Compression and Confinement in Anisotropic Geomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly anisotropic geomaterials undergo fracture under compressive loading. This paper applies a phase-field fracture model to study this fracture process. While phase-field fracture models have several advantages, they provide unphysical predictions when the stress state is complex and includes compression that can cause crack faces to contact.
  Building on a phase-field model that accounts for compressive traction across the crack face, this paper extends the model to anisotropic fracture. The key features include: (1) a homogenized anisotropic elastic response and strongly-anisotropic model for the work to fracture; (2) an effective damage response that accounts consistently for compressive traction across the crack face, that is derived from the anisotropic elastic response; (3) a regularized crack normal field that overcomes the shortcomings of the isotropic setting, and enables the correct crack response, both across and transverse to the crack face.
  To test the model, we first compare the predictions to phase-field fracture evolution calculations in a fully-resolved layered specimen with spatial inhomogeneity, and show that it captures the overall patterns of crack growth. We then apply the model to previously-reported experimental observations of fracture evolution in laboratory specimens of shales under compression with confinement, and find that it predicts well the observed crack patterns in a broad range of loading conditions. We further apply the model to predict the growth of wing cracks under compression and confinement. The effective crack response model enables us to treat the initial crack simply as a non-singular damaged zone within the computational domain, thereby allowing for easy and general computations.</description>

      <title>On some quasianalytic classes of $C^\infty$ functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This expository article is devoted to the notion of quasianalytic classes and the Borel mapping. Although quasianalytic classes are well known in analysis since several decades. We are interested in certain properties of Denjoy-Carleman's quasianalytic classes, such as the non-surjectivity of the Borel mapping, the property of monotonicity. We try to see if it remains true for other quasianalytic classes, such as for example, the classes of indefinitely differentiable functions definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structures. What motivated this is the fact of having shown in a previous article the existence of quasianalytic classes where Borel mapping is surjective.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions of Fully second-order HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the value functions of mean field control problems with common noise are the unique viscosity solutions to fully second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, in a Crandall-Lions-like framework. We allow the second-order derivative in measure to be state-dependent and thus infinite-dimensional, rather than derived from a finite-dimensional operator, hence the term ''fully''. Our argument leverages the construction of smooth approximations from particle systems developed by Cosso, Gozzi, Kharroubi, Pham, and Rosestolato [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2023], and the compactness argument via penalization of measure moments in Soner and Yan [Appl. Math. Optim., 2024]. Our work addresses unbounded dynamics and state-dependent common noise volatility, and to our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sensor Placement on a Cantilever Beam Using Observability Gramians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working from an observability characterization based on output energy sensitivity to changes in initial conditions, we derive both analytical and empirical observability Gramian tools for a class of continuum material systems. Using these results, optimal sensor placement is calculated for an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam for the following cases: analytical observability for the continuum system and analytical observability for a finite number of modes. Error covariance of an Unscented Kalman Filter is determined for both cases and compared to randomly placed sensors to demonstrate effectiveness of the techniques.</description>

      <title>Gap theorems for complete submanifolds in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the seminal Simons' formula, Shen \cite{Shen} and Lin-Xia \cite{LX} obtained gap theorems for compact minimal submanifolds in the unit sphere in the late 1980's. Then due to the effect of Xu \cite{Xu}, Ni \cite{Ni}, Yun \cite{Yun} and Xu-Gu \cite{XuG}, we achieved a comprehensive understanding of gap phenomena of complete submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector field in the sphere or in the Euclidean space. But such kind of results in case of the hyperbolic space were obtained by Wang-Xia \cite{XiaW}, Lin-Wang \cite{LW} and Xu-Xu \cite{XX} until relatively recently and are not quite complete so far.
  In this paper first we continue to study gap theorems for complete submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector field in the hyperbolic space, which generalize or extend several results in the literature. Second we prove a gap theorem for complete hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature $n(1-n)$ in the hyperbolic space, which extends related results due to Bai-Luo \cite{BL2} in cases of the Euclidean space and the unit sphere. Such kind of results in case of the hyperbolic space are more complicated, due to some extra bad terms in the Simons' formula, and one of main ingredients of our proofs is an estimate for the first eigenvalue of complete submanifolds in the hyperbolic space obtained by Lin \cite{Lin}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1802.03066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying lower-semicontinuity of integral functionals in the weak topology of Sobolev spaces is a central theme in the calculus of variations. For integral functionals with $p$-growth, quasiconvexity is a necessary condition for weak lower-semicontinuity in $W^{1,p}$, but is only sufficient if some additional conditions are met.The standard functional showing the necessity of additional conditions is $f\mapsto \int_\Omega \det \nabla f$, which fails to be weakly lower-semicontinuous. However, the common examples showing this failure are non-injective and have a lot of shear. The aim of this short note is to point out that a known sequence of conformal diffeomorphisms of the $d$-dimensional unit ball that converges weakly to a constant in $W^{1,d}$, exemplifies the weak discontinuity of this functional even when restricting a space to functions which are "as nice as possible".</description>

      <title>A class of second-order geometric quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and their application in imaging science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.01457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by important applications in image processing, we study a class of second-order geometric quasilinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). This is inspired by the recent development of second-order damping systems associated to gradient flows for energy decaying. In numerical computations, it turns out that the second-order methods are superior to their first-order counter-parts. We concentrate on (i) a damped second-order total variation flow for e.g., image denoising, and (ii) a damped second-order mean curvature flow for level sets of scalar functions. The latter is connected to a non-convex variational model capable of correcting displacement errors in image data (e.g. dejittering). For the former equation, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution and its long time behavior, and provide an analytical solution given some simple initial datum. For the latter, we draw a connection between the equation and some second-order geometric PDEs evolving the hypersurfaces, and show the existence and uniqueness of the solution for a regularized version of the equation. Finally, some numerical comparison of the solution behavior for the new equations with first-order flows are presented.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniqueness and Inadmissibility of the Vanishing Viscosity Limit of the Passive Scalar Transport Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study selection by vanishing viscosity for the transport of a passive scalar $f(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}$ advected by a bounded, divergence-free vector field $u(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2$. This is described by the initial value problem to the PDE $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot (u f) = 0$, or with positive viscosity/diffusivity $\nu&gt;0$, to the PDE $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot (u f) -\nu\Delta f = 0$. We demonstrate the failure of the vanishing viscosity limit to select (a) unique solutions or (b) physically admissible solutions in the sense of non-increasing energy/entropy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis and Uniqueness of blowup solutions of non-quantized singular mean field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For singular mean field equations defined on a compact Riemann surface, we prove the uniqueness of bubbling solutions as far as blowup points are either regular points or non-quantized singular sources. In particular the uniqueness result covers the most general case extending or improving all previous works of Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-4,bart-4-2} and Wu-Zhang \cite{wu-zhang-ccm}. For example, unlike previous results, we drop the assumption of singular sources being critical points of a suitably defined Kirchoff-Routh type functional. Our argument is based on refined estimates, robust and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of problems requiring a delicate blowup analysis. In particular we come up with several new estimates of independent interest about the concentration phenomenon for Liouville-type equations.</description>

      <title>Non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for Choquard equations with critical combined nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions of the nonlinear Choquard type equation $$ -\Delta u+ \varepsilon u=(I_\alpha \ast |u|^{p})|u|^{p-2}u+ |u|^{q-2}u, \quad {\rm in} \ \mathbb R^N, \qquad (P_\varepsilon)$$ where $N\ge 3$ is an integer, $p\in [\frac{N+\alpha}{N}, \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}]$, $q\in (2,\frac{2N}{N-2}]$, $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in (0,N)$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter. We fix one of $p,q$ as a critical exponent (in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev and Sobolev inequalities ) and view the others in $p,q,\varepsilon, \alpha$ as parameters, we find regions in the $(p,q,\alpha, \varepsilon)$-parameter space, such that the corresponding equation has no positive ground state or admits multiple positive solutions. This is a counterpart of the Brezis-Nirenberg Conjecture (Brezis-Nirenberg, CPAM, 1983) for nonlocal elliptic equation in the whole space. Particularly, some threshold results for the existence of ground states and some conditions which insure two positive solutions are obtained. These results are quite different in nature from the corresponding local equation with combined powers nonlinearity and reveal the special influence of the nonlocal term. To the best of our knowledge, the only two papers concerning the multiplicity of positive solutions of elliptic equations with critical growth nonlinearity are given by Atkinson, Peletier (Nonlinear Anal, 1986) for elliptic equation on a ball and Juncheng Wei, Yuanze Wu (Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh, 2022) for elliptic equation with a combined powers nonlinearity in the whole space. The ODE technique is main ingredient in the proofs of the above mentioned papers, however, ODE technique does not work any more in our model equation due to the presence of the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the mass supercritical Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system: existence, uniqueness, limit behavior, strong instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the normalized ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. This equation has a nonlocal nonlinearity and a mass supercritical power nonlinearity, both of which have deep impact on the geometry of the corresponding functional, and thus on the existence, limit behavior and stability of the normalized ground states. In the present study, the existence of critical points is obtained by a mountain-pass argument developed on the $L^2$-spheres. To be specific, we show that normalized ground states exist, provided that spherical radius of the $L^2$-spheres is sufficiently small. Then, by discussing the relation between the normalized ground states of the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system and the classical Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we show a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the normalized ground states as the mass vanishes or tends to infinity. Moreover, we discuss the radial symmetry and uniqueness of the normalized ground states. Finally, the strong instability of standing waves at the mountain-pass energy level is studied by constructing an equivalent minimizing problem. Also, as a byproduct, we prove that the mountain-pass energy level gives a threshold for global existence based on this equivalent minimizing problem.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for 1D cubic defocusing dispersive equations, Part IV: general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad conjecture, formulated by the authors in earlier work, reads as follows: "Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial data have global dispersive solutions". Notably, here smallness is only assumed in $H^s$ Sobolev spaces, without any localization assumption.
  The conjecture was initially proved by the authors first for a class of semilinear Schr\"odinger type models, and then for quasilinear Schr\"odinger flows. In this work we take the next natural step, and prove the above conjecture for a much larger class of one dimensional semilinear dispersive problems with a cubic nonlinearity, where the dispersion relation is no longer of Schr\"odinger type.
  This result is the first of its kind, for any 1D cubic problem not of Schr\"odinger type. Furthermore, it only requires initial data smallness at critical regularity, a threshold that has never been reached before for any 1D cubic dispersive flow. In terms of dispersive decay, we prove that our global in time solutions satisfy both global $L^6_{t,x}$ Strichartz estimates and bilinear $L^2_{t,x}$ bounds.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions on large smooth domains to the Schr\"{o}dinger equations with potential and combined nonlinearities: The Sobolev critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of prescribed mass solutions to the following nonlinear Schrodinger equations with mixed nonlinearities. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain normalized solutions is invalid as the presence of potential. Besides, Our study can be regarded as a Sobolev critical case complement of Bartsch-Qi-Zou (Math Ann 390, 4813-4859, 2024), which has addressed an open problem raised in Bartsch et al.(Commun Partial Differ Equ 46(9):1729--1756,2021).</description>

      <title>A generalized three lines lemma in Hardy-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the following question: given a holomorphic function with prescribed $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^q(\mathbb{R})$ norm (with $1\leq p,q \leq \infty$) along two parallel lines in the complex plane, then what is the maximum value that this function can achieve at a given point between these lines. Here we show that this problem is well-posed in suitable Hardy-like spaces on the strip. Moreover, in this setting we completely solve this problem by providing not only an explicit formula for the optimizers but also for the optimal values. In addition, we briefly discuss some applications of these results to interpolation theory and to Lieb-Thirring inequalities.</description>
