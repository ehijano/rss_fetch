      <title>From Local Earthquake Nowcasting to Natural Time Forecasting: A Simple Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous papers have outlined nowcasting methods to track the current state of earthquake hazard using only observed seismic catalogs. The basis for one of these methods, the "counting method", is the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) magnitude-frequency relation. The GR relation states that for every large earthquake of magnitude greater than MT , there are on average NGR small earthquakes of magnitude MS. In this paper we use this basic relation, combined with the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) formalism from machine learning, to compute the probability of a large earthquake. The probability is conditioned on the number of small earthquakes n(t) that have occurred since the last large earthquake. We work in natural time, which is defined as the count of small earthquakes between large earthquakes. We do not need to assume a probability model, which is a major advantage. Instead, the probability is computed as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) associated with the ROC curve. We find that the PPV following the last large earthquake initially decreases as more small earthquakes occur, indicating the property of temporal clustering of large earthquakes as is observed. As the number of small earthquakes continues to accumulate, the PPV subsequently begins to increase. Eventually a point is reached beyond which the rate of increase becomes much larger and more dramatic. Here we describe and illustrate the method by applying it to a local region around Los Angeles, California, following the January 17, 1994 magnitude M6.7 Northridge earthquake.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for flash drought forecasting and interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flash droughts are increasingly occurring worldwide due to climate change, causing widespread socioeconomic and agricultural losses. However, timely and accurate flash drought forecasting remains challenging for operational forecast systems due to uncertain representations of interactive hydroclimate processes. Here, we introduce the Interpretable Transformer for Drought (IT-Drought), a deep learning model based on publicly available hydroclimate data. IT-Drought skillfully forecasts soil moisture up to 42 days and flash droughts up to 11 days ahead on average across the contiguous U.S., substantially outperforming existing forecast systems limited to 10-day skillful soil moisture forecasting and unable to forecast flash droughts. IT-Drought offers novel data-driven interpretability on flash drought onset, benchmarking the memory effects of soil moisture, and revealing heterogeneous impacts and effective time ranges of climatic conditions, predominantly radiation and temperature. The findings highlight the potential of leveraging IT-Drought for early warning and mechanistic investigation of flash droughts, ultimately supporting drought risk mitigation.</description>
