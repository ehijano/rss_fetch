      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ of measures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$ to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We also prove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e. $x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can include families of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal, non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.
  As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contracting conformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)} \}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.
  We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similarity dimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translations the multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval $\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.
  We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a self-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without any separation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Opinion Dynamics with Heterogeneous Bounded Confidences and Random Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a heterogeneous multidimensional bounded confidence (BC) opinion dynamics with random pairwise interactions, whereby each pair of agents accesses each other's opinions with a specific probability. This revised model is motivated by the observation that the standard Hegselmann-Krause (HK) dynamics requires unrealistic all-to-all interactions at certain configurations. For this randomized BC opinion dynamics, regardless of initial opinions and positive confidence bounds, we show that the agents' states converge to fixed final opinions in finite time almost surely and that the convergence rate follows a negative exponential distribution in mean square. Furthermore, we establish sufficient conditions for the heterogeneous BC opinion dynamics with random interactions to achieve consensus in finite time.</description>

      <title>Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dynamic systems using genetic algorithms with dynamic search limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for describing, predicting, and understanding complex phenomena exhibited by real-world systems. However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Persistence/extinction scenarios in an almost periodic metapopulation with competition and habitat destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an almost periodic version of a metapopulation model developed by Tilman \textit{et.al} and Nee \textit{et.al} in the nineties, which generalizes the classical Levins approach by considering several species in competition affected by habitat destruction. The novelty is to assume that the colonization and extinction rates are positive almost periodic functions whereas our main results show that the predominance of either colonization or extinction forces of a specific species is equivalent to the property of exponential dichotomy of a scalar linear differential equation. By using well known results of exponential dichotomy theory, we carry out a recursive and exhaustive description of persistence/extinction scenarios. In addition, we start a preliminary discussion describing a more elusive behavior when the colonization and extinction forces are similar in average.</description>

      <title>The Ricci curvature and the normalized Ricci flow on the Stiefel manifolds $\operatorname{SO}(n)/\operatorname{SO}(n-2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proved that on every Stiefel manifold $V_2\mathbb{R}^n\cong \operatorname{SO}(n)/\operatorname{SO}(n-2)$ with $n\ge 3$ the normalized Ricci flow preserves the positivity of the Ricci curvature of invariant Riemannian metrics with positive Ricci curvature. Moreover, the normalized Ricci flow evolves all metrics with mixed Ricci curvature into metrics with positive Ricci curvature in finite time. From the point of view of the theory of dynamical systems we proved that for every invariant set~$\Sigma$ of the normalized Ricci flow on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as $x_1^{n-2}x_2^{n-2}x_3=c$, $c&gt;0$, there exists a smaller invariant set $\Sigma\cap \mathscr{R}_{+}$ for every $n\ge 3$, where~$\mathscr{R}_{+}$ is the domain in $\mathbb{R}_{+}^3$ responsible for parameters $x_1, x_2, x_3&gt;0$ of invariant Riemannian metrics on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ admitting positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On multiplicative recurrence along linear patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence for actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and provided some sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition for $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely multiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully characterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter property. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning the pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun. In addition, we prove that, under the same conditions on $(a,b,c,d)$, the set $S$ is a set of recurrence for finitely generated actions of $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For random compositions of independent and identically distributed measurable maps on a Polish space, we study the existence and finitude of absolutely continuous ergodic stationary probability measures (which are, in particular, physical measures) whose basins of attraction cover the whole space almost everywhere. We characterize and hierarchize such random maps in terms of their associated Markov operators, as well as show the difference between classes in the hierarchy by plenty of examples, including additive noise, multiplicative noise, and iterated function systems. We also provide sufficient practical conditions for a random map to belong to these classes. For instance, we establish that any continuous random map on a compact Riemannian manifold with absolutely continuous transition probability has finitely many physical measures whose basins of attraction cover Lebesgue almost all the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $1\le r\le \infty$, we show that every diffeomorphism of a manifold of the form $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times M$ is a total renormalization of a $C^r$-close to identity map. In other words, for every diffeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times M$, there exists a map $g$ arbitrarily close to identity such that the first return map of $g$ to a domain is conjugate to $f$ and moreover the orbit of this domain is equal to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times M$. This enables us to localize nearby the identity the existence of many properties in dynamical systems, such as being Bernoulli for a smooth volume form.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any linear system with unreduced dynamics governed by invertible propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.</description>

Abstract: We recall theorems by Krygin, Atkinson, Shneiberg and propose the following assertion. Let $T_t$ be an ergodic flow on $(X,\mu)$, let a function $f$ on $X$ have zero mean, and $\mu(A)&gt;0$ for $A\subset X$. Then for almost all $x\in A$ with $f(x)\neq 0$ there exists a sequence $t_k\to\infty$ such that $\int_0^{t_k}f(T_sx)ds=0$ and $T_{t_k}x\in A$.</description>

      <title>The random periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of random periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of McKean-Vlasov type driven by a two-sided Brownian motion, where the random periodic behaviour is characterised by the equations' long-time behaviour. Given the well-known connection between McKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems, we show propagation of chaos and that the key properties of the interacting particle systems recover those of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the particle limit. All results in the present work are shown under two settings: fully and partially dissipative case. Each setting has its challenges and limitations. For instance, weakening full dissipativity to partial dissipativity demands stronger structural assumptions on the equations' dynamics and yields random periodic behaviour in the weak sense instead of pathwise sense (as in the full dissipativity case). The proof mechanisms are close but fundamentally different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>Linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs at the edge of stability perform Fourier decomposition of the input driving signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the representational structure of linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) operating at the edge of stability. We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</description>
