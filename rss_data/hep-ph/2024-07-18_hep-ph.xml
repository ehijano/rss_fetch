      <title>Top Quark Mass Extractions from Energy Correlators: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, we proposed an energy correlator-based method to achieve a precision top quark mass extraction from jet substructure, using the $W$-boson mass as a standard candle. In this paper, we perform an extensive event generator simulation study of this proposal, testing both its experimental viability, as well as its sensitivity to different subprocesses in the top quark production and decay. On the experimental side, we show that uncertainties in the jet energy scale, constituent energy scale, and tracking efficiency have a minimal effect. On the theoretical side, we find that our observable isolates the perturbative decay of the top quark, while nonperturbative physics, such as the modelling of color reconnection, and underlying event, have a negligible impact on the distribution. We conclude that our proposed measurement is resilient to the experimental and theoretical aspects of the hadron collider environment, with variations in model parameters consistently leading to $\lesssim 100~$MeV shifts in the measured top mass. Our results motivate precision theoretical calculations of the energy correlator on top decays, both analytic and using parton shower generators, and further exploration of the experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Generalised hydrogen interactions with $\texttt{CINCO}$: a window to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present semi-analytic solutions for atomic transition rates in hydrogenic atoms induced by scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor interactions. Our results agree with quantum electrodynamics predictions to $\sim 0.005\,\%$ precision, and further allow us to calculate absorption and emission rates for axions, hidden photons, light scalars or other dark matter candidates for hydrogen and hydrogenic ions. These results can be used to inform searches for light new physics as well as in calculations relevant to searches for fifth forces or varying fundamental constants, with applications from astrophysics to laboratory spectroscopy experiments. We also provide a dedicated tool for the construction of hydrogenic transition amplitudes: "Computation of hydrogen radial INtegrals and COefficients" ($\texttt{CINCO}$).</description>

      <title>A Light QCD Axion with Hilltop Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a light QCD axion and identify the parameter space to obtain the correct relic dark matter abundance. The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\bar\theta$ shifted by $\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created "hilltop" near $\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this "hilltop" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin asymmetries and the electron Yukawa coupling at an FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that measurements of single transverse-spin asymmetries at an $e^+e^-$ collider can enhance the sensitivity to the electron Yukawa coupling, possibly enabling observation of the Standard Model value for this quantity. We demonstrate that the significance in both the $b\bar{b}$ and semi-leptonic $WW$ final states can be enhanced by factors of up to three compared to inclusive cross section determinations of this coupling for transversely-polarized electrons. If the positrons can be simultaneously longitudinally polarized, even at the level of 30\%, the significance can be enhanced by a factor of five or more. The method utilizes quantum interference between the Higgs signal and the continuum background and is also applicable in other $WW$ and $ZZ$ final states.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Study of Lepton Flavor Violation in Z Boson Decays with Constrained MSSM Extended by Type-II Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the upper limit of the branching ratio (BR) of the lepton flavor violation (LFV) of Z boson decaying into \left(\mathrm{Z\longrightarrow}\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{\mp}\mathrm{\ } \mathrm{\tau}^\mathrm{\pm}\right),\left(\mathrm{Z\longrightarrow}\mathrm{\mu}^\mathrm{\mp}\mathrm{\tau}^\mathrm{\pm}\right),\left(\mathrm{Z\rightarrow}{\mathrm{\ e}}^\mathrm{\pm}\mathrm{\mu}^\mathrm{\mp}\right) .This study is conducted in the context of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) which is extended by Seesaw type-II model. The decay rate of LFV processes is calculated in the CMSSM model at the grand unified scale ~2\times{10}^{16} GeV. The upper limit predicted results of LFV processes of branching ratio (BR) of Z boson decays for the three decay channels are found to be in the order of \mathrm{~1\times}{\mathrm{10}}^{\mathrm{-9}}, \mathrm{~1\times}{\mathrm{10}}^{\mathrm{-9}}and \mathrm{~1\times}{\mathrm{10}}^{\mathrm{-10}} respectively, which corresponds with the predicted sensitivity of the future colliders (FCC-ee/CEPC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasi two-zero neutrino texture based on type-II seesaw model in a modular $A_4$ symmetry to evade the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass while keeping some predictability in neutrino sector. Working on three fixed points for modulus, we discuss predictions of the model and show the allowed points satisfying the cosmological bound on neutrino mass from both CMB and CMB+BAO data.</description>

      <title>Possible molecules of triple-heavy pentaquarks within the extended local hidden gauge formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the meson-baryon interactions of the open heavy sectors to search for the possible triple-heavy molecular pentaquarks, where the meson-baryon interaction potentials are obtained with the vector meson exchange mechanism within the extended local hidden gauge formalism. The scattering amplitudes are evaluated by solving the coupled channel Bethe-Salpeter equation, where some bound systems are found. With the poles of the amplitudes in the complex plane, the masses and widths of these bound states are obtained. Furthermore, we also calculate the couplings and compositenesses of different channels in each bound system to check their molecular nature. We predict four $\Omega_{ccc}$-like states, four $\Omega_{bbb}$-like states, fourteen $\Omega_{bcc}$-like states, and ten $\Omega_{bbc}$-like states, which can be hunted experimentally in future.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.</description>

Abstract: We present a recent calculation of the quark and gluon contributions to the angular momentum of a composite spin -$1/2$ state in QCD. The state we consider is a quark dressed with a gluon, and we use the two-component framework in light-front Hamiltonian QCD. We compare the results from different decompositions available in the literature. We also present the angular momentum distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent CMS observations in the di-$J/\psi$ invariant mass spectrum reveal new structures at 6638 MeV ($X(6600)$)) and 7134 MeV, and confirm the $X(6900)$ at 6847 MeV. These findings provide crucial insights into four-charm-quark matter. The CMS Collaboration's result serves as a testament to the progress in exploring exotic hadronic matter.</description>

      <title>Identifying the two-pole structure of the $\Lambda(1405)$ using an SU(3) flavor filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to identify the two-pole structure of the $\Lambda(1405)$. The two poles owe their origin to different quark flavor irreducible representations in the meson-baryon coupled-channel interactions, thus they should be individually manifested in reactions that provide good flavor eigenstate sources. Hadronic decays of charmonia into $\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\pi$ and $\bar{\Lambda}(1520)\Sigma\pi$ are such reactions, and the flavor octet and singlet poles can be approximately singled out in these two decay modes. This SU(3) flavor filter works even considering the flavor symmetry breaking. With the huge charmonium data sets collected, it is therefore promising to solve the long-standing $\Lambda(1405)$ puzzle employing the proposed flavor filter.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\lambda_{B_s}$ by $B_s\to \gamma^*$ and $B_s\to \phi$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the form factors $F_{V}(q^2,q'^2)$ and $F_{TV}(q^2,q'^2)$ describing the $B_s\to \gamma^*$ transition induced by the vector and tensor weak currents in a broad range of values of $q^2$ and $q'^2$ far below the quark thresholds in both $q^2$ and $q'^2$ channels. These form factors are calculated via the distribution amplitudes of the $B_s$-meson. We then interpolate the obtained results by a formula that contains pole at $q'^2=M_\phi^2$ and extract the residue which gives the $B_s\to \phi$ transition form factors $V(q^2)$ and $T_1(q^2)$. In this way we obtain theoretical predictions for these form factors without invoking quark-hadron duality and QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we calculate the relationship between $V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ and the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}(\mu)$, the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude. Using the available predictions for $V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ coming from approaches not referring to the $B_s$-meson distribution amplitudes, we obtain the estimate $\lambda_{B_s}(\mu\simeq m_b)=(0.62\pm 0.10)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>$X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ in process $B^+\to D^+ D^- K^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nature of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ based on experimental results of the process $B^+$$\to$$D^+ D^- K^+$. We focus on the S-wave $D^{*-}K^{*+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$ molecular states, which can be related to the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$, respectively. Using effective Lagrangians, we construct the potential kernel of the $D^{*-}K^{*+}$$-$$D^{-}K^{+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$$-$$D^+D^-$ interactions with a one-boson-exchange model, and determine the scattering amplitudes and their poles through a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. By incorporating the potential kernel into the three-body decay process $B^+$$\to$$D^+ D^- K^+$, we evaluate the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra, as well as the Dalitz plot, with Monte Carlo simulation. A satisfactory fit to the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra is achieved after introducing additional Breit-Wigner resonances, the $X_1(2900)$, $\psi(3770)$, and $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ states. Prominent signals of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ states appear as peaks in the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra near 2900 and 3930 MeV, respectively. Clear event concentration of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_0(3930)$ states is evident as strips in the Dalitz plot. The results suggest that both $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ can be interpreted as molecular states, with the inclusion of $X_1(2900)$ and $\chi_2(3930)$ necessary to describe structures in the regions near 2900 and 3930 MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Standard Model, the branching fraction of the $B_s\to K^0\overline{K}{}^0$ decay is related to other decay rates and CP asymmetries through the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry of the strong interactions. Three such relations were shown to be violated at a level of about $3\sigma$ each. By means of a systematic search for new physics explanations of these puzzles, we find that possible solutions are highly fine-tuned and rather implausible.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Decays of a Higgs-mixed Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the portals to new physics is a light scalar coupled to the Standard Model (SM) Higgs. In this paper we focus on hadronic decays of such a scalar in the regime where QCD dynamics is nonperturbative, resulting, e.g., in decays to pairs of pions or kaons, while also allowing for scalar couplings to the SM fermions to deviate from the Higgs-mixed light scalar limit. Representations of the corresponding form factors can be obtained using dispersive techniques, however, several sources of uncertainty affect the final results. We reexamine these decays, paying special attention to the quantification of uncertainties. For the light Higgs-mixed scalar scenario, we compare our results with previous works. For a general set of couplings of the light scalar to Standard Model fields, we provide a public code, {\tt hipsofcobra}, to compute the decay widths.</description>

      <title>Small Neutrino Masses from a Decoupled Singlet Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified solution with $Z_4$ discrete symmetry for small neutrino masses and stability of dark matter. Our model consists of an inert doublet scalar, a dark singlet scalar $S$, a spurion scalar $\varphi$ and right-handed neutrinos beyond the Standard Model (SM), which transform nontrivially under $Z_4$. Once the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$ by the VEV of $\varphi$, much below the mass scale of the singlet scalar $S$, a small quartic coupling between SM Higgs and inert doublets, which violates both $Z_4$ and lepton number, is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at one-loops. We discuss the consistent parameter space for neutrino masses, direct detection and thermal leptogenesis in the model.</description>

      <title>Dimuon and ditau production in photon-photon collisions at next-to-leading order in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the production of muon and tau pairs in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, are calculated in the equivalent photon approximation. We mostly consider $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions of hadrons at the LHC, but the $\gamma\gamma\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ process in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at LEP is also discussed. The NLO terms are found to modify the total cross sections by up to 5%, increasing the tails of the dilepton acoplanarity and transverse momentum distributions, and depleting by up to 15% the yields at high masses, with respect to the leading-order predictions including the very small virtuality of the colliding photons. At the LHC, the calculations obtained with the charge form factor for protons and lead ions including the NLO QED corrections improve the data--theory agreement for all measured differential distributions, and prove an indispensable ingredient for the extraction of precision quantities in photon-photon processes, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>On the collider-testability of the type-I seesaw model with 3 right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If any heavy neutral leptons are discovered in accelerator-based experiments, key questions will involve their possible connection to neutrino masses or leptogenesis. Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information about the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the branching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM generations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be measured with arbitrary precision, they would be sufficient to pin down all 18 parameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data. When considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can be achieved by future lepton colliders in the mass range of tens of GeV, some parameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful consistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range similar sensitivities can be expected for SHiP and DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to not only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in understanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to probe a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) with Josephson Junction Switching Current Detector (JJSCD). The sensitivity for the shear can reach $h\simeq 10^{-19}$ realistically, $10^{-21}$ in the near future, $10^{-24}$ optimistically. If we utilize the enhancement factor from the ratio of the frequency, it is possible to reach further below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. It will be interesting if we can access the region to discover a footprint of new physics.</description>

      <title>Systematic moment expansion for electroweak baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic moment expansion for solving the semiclassical Boltzmann equations for electroweak baryogenesis. The expansion is developed in powers of adiabatic coordinate velocity, and it is used for computing the CP-violating seed asymmetry at the front of the phase transition wall, that sources the eventual baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). We implement the method in a benchmark model, with a CP-violating mass arising from a dimension-5 operator coupling the fermion to a singlet scalar field. We find that the higher moment calculations yield a BAU that can significantly differ from the commonly used two-moment approximation. We discuss in detail the underlying approximations in the moment method and propose a new truncation scheme for the expansion, that appears to give more numerically robust results than the previous schemes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Neutrino Masses In Clockwork Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have looked at various variants of the clockwork model and studied their impact on the neutrino masses. Some of the generalizations such as generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already been explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\left| q \right| &gt; 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</description>

      <title>The legacy of boson clouds on black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons can leave an imprint on the gravitational waveform of black hole binaries through "ionization" and "resonances". We study the sequence of resonances as the binary evolves, and show that there are only two possible outcomes, each with a distinct imprint on the waveform. If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the cloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases, resonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and its eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of inferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a population of black holes binaries.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of $\mu$Hz Gravitational Waves with FRB Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fast Radio Burst (FRB) timing, which uses the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of repeated FRB signals along multiple sightlines, as a new probe of gravitational waves (GWs) around nHz to $\mu$Hz frequencies, with the highest frequency limited by FRB repeating period. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of tens of AU, achieved by sending radio telescopes to space. We find the signal of arrival time difference induced by GWs depends only on the local GWs in the solar system and we can correlate the measurements from different FRB sources or the same source with different repeaters, which leads to a better sensitivity with a larger number of FRB repeaters detected. The projected sensitivity shows this method is a competitive probe in the nHz to $\mu$Hz frequency range. It can fill the '$\mu$Hz gap' between pulsar timing arrays and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and is complementary to other proposals of GW detection in this frequency band.</description>

      <title>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster -- Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</description>

      <title>First lattice QCD calculation of $J/\psi$ semileptonic decay containing $D$ and $D_s$ particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice calculation on the semileptonic decay of $J/\psi$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. Three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from 0.0519 fm to 0.1053 fm, and pion masses, $m_{\pi}\sim$ 300 MeV, are utilized. After a naive continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D_s e\nu_e)=1.90(6)(5)_{V_{cs}}\times 10^{-10}$ and $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D e\nu_e)=1.21(6)(9)_{V_{cd}}\times 10^{-11}$, where the first errors are statistical, and the second come from the uncertainties of CKM matrix element $V_{cs(d)}$. The ratios of the branching fractions between lepton $\mu$ and $e$ are also calculated as $R_{J/\psi}(D_s)=0.97002(8)$ and $R_{J/\psi}(D)=0.97423(15)$ after performing a continuum limit including only $a^2$ term. The ratios provide necessary theoretical support for the future experimental test of lepton flavor universality.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group analysis of the quark-condensation pattern on the Fermi surface: A simple effective-model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple effective model for the intermediate-density regime is constructed from the high-density effective theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In the effective model, under a renormalization-group (RG) scaling towards low momenta, the original QCD interactions lead to four-quark contact interactions for the relevant quark and hole modes around the Fermi surface. The contact interaction in the scalar channel can be traced back to zero-sound-type collinear quark scattering near the Fermi surface in an instanton background. The quark and hole states in opposite directions of a given Fermi velocity form the collective scalar bosonic mode $\sigma$. The magnitude of $\sigma$ is investigated via the non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) evolution of the effective average action from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR). In the mean background-field approximation for $\sigma$, nontrivial minima ($\bar{\sigma} \neq 0$) are found in the IR limit of the effective average action. A nonvanishing $\bar{\sigma}$ corresponds to condensation of quark and hole states in opposite directions of a given Fermi velocity, in a thin shell-like structure in momentum space around the Fermi surface. This looks similar to the shell-like baryon distribution in momentum space assumed in the quarkyonic-matter concept. However, when including a dynamic bosonic $\sigma$-mode in the RG flow, we find that its diffusive nature destroys the quark-hole condensate, i.e., the IR potential does not show any minima beyond the trivial one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background C$_{\nu}$B with other observables, namely: cold dark matter density, effective weak lensing convergence, neutrino velocity and neutrino deflection angle. We provide, for the first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to illustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino background is measured. As cross-correlations will have more signal than auto-correlations of the C$_{\nu}$B itself, these might be the ones to be measured first by Ptolemy-like experiments. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what massive neutrinos should look like from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Dissecting polytopes: Landau singularities and asymptotic expansions in $2\to 2$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric representations of Feynman integrals have a key property: many, frequently all, of the Landau singularities appear as endpoint divergences. This leads to a geometric interpretation of the singularities as faces of Newton polytopes, which facilitates algorithmic evaluation by sector decomposition and asymptotic expansion by the method of regions. Here we identify cases where some singularities appear instead as pinches in parametric space for general kinematics, and we then extend the applicability of sector decomposition and the method of regions algorithms to such integrals, by dissecting the Newton polytope on the singular locus. We focus on $2\to 2$ massless scattering, where we show that pinches in parameter space occur starting from three loops in particular nonplanar graphs due to cancellation between terms of opposite sign in the second Symanzik polynomial. While the affected integrals cannot be evaluated by standard sector decomposition, we show how they can be computed by first linearising the graph polynomial and then splitting the integration domain at the singularity, so as to turn it into an endpoint divergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that obtaining the correct asymptotic expansion of such integrals by the method of regions requires the introduction of new regions, which can be systematically identified as facets of the dissected polytope. In certain instances, these hidden regions exclusively govern the leading power behaviour of the integral. In momentum space, we find that in the on-shell expansion for wide-angle scattering the new regions are characterised by having two or more connected hard subgraphs, while in the Regge limit they are characterised by Glauber modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the framework of Standard Model Effective Field Theory, we performed a few global fits, each containing a subset of dimension-6 operators, for the measurements that are expected at future colliders. The fit for the Higgs and electroweak sector improves what has been done for the European Strategy Update in 2020 on both EFT treatments and experimental inputs. A new comprehensive fit is performed focusing on 4-fermion interactions at future colliders. Top-quark sector is studied in a dedicated fit which restricts the operators and measurements to be directly related to top-quark. A small subset of CP-violating operators involving bosonic fields alone are also investigated. Various running scenarios for future e+e- and Muon Colliders that are suggested in the Snowmass 2021 discussion are considered in the global fits. The outcomes from each fit are expressed in terms of either direct constraint on Wilson Coefficients or precision on Higgs and electroweak effective couplings.</description>

Abstract: The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is the golden process for investigating the nucleon's transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) structure. We present the complete expression for SIDIS structure functions in the TMD factorization formalism at the next-to-leading power. All perturbative elements of the factorization theorem -- coefficient functions and evolution kernels -- are presented at one-loop accuracy. We found several differences with earlier derivations, which are due to accounting for nontrivial kinematics of the quark-gluon interference terms. As a side result, we present the definition and evolution of twist-three TMD fragmentation functions, including the leading-order evolution kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous contributions to the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton from new physics scenarios have brought renewed interest in the development of new charge-parity violating signatures in $\tau$-pair production at Belle II energies, and also at higher energies of the Large Hadron Collider and the Future Circular Collider. In this paper, we discuss the effects of spin correlations, including transverse degrees of freedom, in the $\tau$-pair production and decay. These studies include calculating analytical formulas, obtaining numerical results, and building semi-realistic observables sensitive to the transverse spin correlations induced by the dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton. The effects of such anomalous contributions to the dipole moments are introduced on top of precision simulations of $e^-e^+ \to \tau^-\tau^+$, $q\bar{q} \to \tau^-\tau^+$ and $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^-\tau^+$ processes, involving multi-body final states. The $\tau$ decays are simulated along with radiative corrections, in particular electroweak box contributions of $WW$ and $ZZ$ exchanges are taken into account. Respective extensions of the Standard Model amplitudes and the reweighting algorithms are implemented into the KKMC Monte Carlo, which is used to simulate $\tau$-pair production in $e^-e^+$ collisions, and the TauSpinner program, which is used to reweight events with $\tau$ pair produced in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Radiative Leptonic Decay of Heavy Quarkonia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the properties of heavy quarkonia $X$ by treating them as bound states of $Q$ and $\bar{Q}$ at the LO level within the NRQCD framework, where $Q$ represents either a charm or a bottom quark. The branching ratios for the radiative leptonic decays $X\rightarrow \gamma l^{+} l^{-}$ are revisited and the angular and energy/momentum distributions of the final state particles are analyzed in the rest frame of $X$. Furthermore, we apply Lorentz transformations from the rest frame of $X$ to the center-of-mass frame of $l^+ l^-$ to establish the connection between the widths ${\Gamma_{X \rightarrow \gamma l^{+} l^{-}}}$ and ${\Gamma_{X \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}}}$. When comparing the connection with those documented in the literature (divided by $2\pi$) for various $X$ states, such as $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, and $\Upsilon(2S)$, relative differences typically around or below 10\% can be found, which is comparable to the NLO corrections of $O(\alpha)$ and $O(v^4)$. However, we observe a significant disparity in the ratio between ${\Gamma_{\Psi(2S) \to \gamma \tau^+ \tau^-}}$ and ${\Gamma_{\Psi(2S) \to \tau^+ \tau^-}}$, with our prediction being four times larger than those in the literature. The outcomes derived from this study held practical implications in describing the QED radiative processes and contribute to the investigation of QCD processes associated with the decays of heavy quarkonia and the searches for new physics.</description>

Abstract: Unstable particles decay sooner or later, so they are not described by asymptotic one-particle states and they should not be included as independent states in unitarity relations such as the optical theorem. The same applies to any countable collection of unstable particles. We show that the behaviour of unparticle stuff, that is, a continuous collection of particles with different masses and common decay channels, is pretty different: it has a non-vanishing probability of surviving for ever and the corresponding asymptotic states must be taken into account to comply with unitarity. We also discuss compressed spectra and the transition from the discrete to the continuous case.</description>

      <title>Real-time Dynamics of the Schwinger Model as an Open Quantum System with Neural Density Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Asymmetric Dark Matter using Colliders and Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reappraise the viability of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) realized as a Dirac fermion coupling dominantly to the Standard Model fermions. Treating the interactions of such a DM particle with quarks/leptons in an effective-interactions framework, we derive updated constraints using mono-jet searches from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and mono-photon searches at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. We carefully model the detectors used in these experiments, which is found to have significant impact. The constraint of efficient annihilation of the symmetric part of the ADM, as well as other observational constraints are synthesized to produce a global picture. Consistent with previous work, we find that ADM with mass in the range $1-100$ GeV is strongly constrained, thus ruling out its best motivated mass range. However, we find that leptophilic ADM remains allowed for $\gtrsim 10$ GeV DM, including bounds from colliders, direct detection, and stellar heating. We forecast that the Future Circular Collider for electron-positron collisions (FCC-ee) will improve sensitivity to DM-lepton interactions by almost an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the $\Omega(2012)$ from QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the recently observed $\Omega(2012)$ baryon in QCD sum rules. We construct the $P$-wave $\Omega$ baryon currents with a covariant derivative, and perform spin projection to obtain the currents with total spin 1/2 and 3/2. We then apply the parity-projected QCD sum rules to separate the contributions of the positive and negative parity states. We extract the masses of $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states to be $M_{1/2^-} = 2.07^{+0.07}_{-0.07}{\rm~GeV}$ and $M_{3/2^-} = 2.05^{+0.09}_{-0.10}{\rm~GeV}$. Both results are in good agreement with the experimental result. Therefore, it is likely that the $\Omega(2012)$ is a negative parity state, which is interpreted as a $P$-wave excited state in the quark model. However, its spin is not determined in the present analysis, which can be done by detailed study on its decay properties.</description>

Abstract: Generalized uncertainty principles are effective changes to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that emerge in several quantum gravity models. In the present letter, we study the consequences that two classes of these modifications yield on the physics of neutrinos. Besides analyzing the change in the oscillation probabilities that the generalized uncertainty principles entail, we assess their impact on the neutrino coherence length and their possible interpretation as nonstandard neutrino interactions. Constraints cast by present and planned neutrino experiments on the generalized uncertainty principles parameters are also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple theory where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry is proposed. In this context, the gauge anomalies are cancelled with the minimal number of extra fermionic fields and one predicts that the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The properties of the neutrino sector are discussed showing that this theory predicts a $3+2$ light neutrino sector. We show that using the same fermionic fields one can gauge the baryon number and define a simple theory where the lepton and baryon numbers can be spontaneously broken at the low scale in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>New constraints on CPT symmetry violation in charm mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small CPT-violating effects are admissible in several theories beyond the Standard Model of interactions. We analyse experimental data obtained with neutral flavoured meson mixing and place bounds on the scale of such phenomena. The constraints on the CPT-violating parameter $z$ are derived by reinterpreting the LHCb measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in the Cabbibo-favoured $D^0 \rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}$ and $\bar{D}^0 \rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay rates. The bounds provided in this paper are two orders of magnitude stricter compared to the results obtained by the FOCUS Collaboration. Among other constraints, we report bounds on the difference in the decay widths and masses of the neutral D meson flavour states at a 95 % confidence level. The decay width difference is bounded by $(-4.7&lt;\delta\Gamma_D&lt;2.1)\times 10^{-16}$GeV. The mass difference lies within~$(-2.0&lt;\delta m_D&lt;2.0)\times 10^{-15}$GeV for 95% of $\text{arg}(z)$ values. The paper includes an assessment of the influence of CP violation on the results and a discussion of the future prospects.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\Xi_c^* \bar K$ molecular pentaquark state by its electromagnetic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as $\mu_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu_N$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\rm{fm^2}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We present a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) global QCD analysis of the proton's helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs), the first of its kind. To obtain the distributions, we use data for longitudinal spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon scattering as well as in weak-boson and hadron or jet production in proton-proton scattering. We analyze the data using QCD perturbation theory at NNLO accuracy, employing approximations provided by the threshold resummation formalism in cases where full NNLO results for partonic hard-scattering functions are not readily available. Our numerical results suggest a remarkable perturbative stability of the extracted helicity PDFs.</description>

      <title>Axion-Gauge Dynamics During Inflation as the Origin of Pulsar Timing Array Signals and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently announced signal for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) observations, if attributed to new physics, is compatible with primordial GW production due to axion-gauge dynamics during inflation. More specifically we find that axion-$U(1)$ models may lead to sufficient particle production to explain the signal while simultaneously source some fraction of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) as a signature. Moreover there is a parity violation in GW sector, hence the model suggests chiral GW search as a concrete target for future. We further analyze the axion-$SU(2)$ coupling signatures and find that in the low/mild backreaction regime, it is incapable of producing PTA evidence and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is low at the peak, hence it overproduces scalar perturbations and PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD result for the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron. Our calculation includes both quark-connected and -disconnected diagrams and assesses all sources of systematic uncertainties arising from excited-state contributions, finite-volume effects and the continuum extrapolation. At the physical point, we obtain for the proton $r_Z^p = ( 1.013 \pm 0.010\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_F^p = ( 1.301 \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.014\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$. These numbers suggest small values of the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton, but are compatible with most of the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>First constraints on non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg inflation and massive neutrino self-interactions with Planck+BICEP/Keck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, for the first time in literature, we study the predictions of non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the $n_s-r$ plane, and an extended $\Lambda$CDM model where we include non-standard self-interactions among massive neutrinos, mediated by a heavy scalar or vector boson. Constraints were derived using the Planck 2018 + BICEP/Keck 2018 datasets along with other data. For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments.
  In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck 2018 and BICEP/Keck 2018 collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements. We find that there are some situations where predictions from the inflationary models are ruled out at more than 2$\sigma$ by the minimal $\Lambda$CDM$+r$ model, but they are allowed in the self-interacting neutrino scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay in covariant density functional theory with different mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. The results demonstrate that the combined NMEs based on the Feynman diagrams at the hadronic scale for the nonstandard mechanisms lead to uncertainty by different nuclear models comparable to that for the standard mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not dramatically change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.</description>

Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>Dark photon constraints from a 7.139 GHz cavity haloscope experiment</title>

Abstract: The dark photon is a promising candidate for the dark matter which comprises most of the matter in our visible Universe. Via kinetic mixing with the Standard Model it can also be resonantly converted to photons in an electromagnetic cavity, offering novel experimental possibilities for the discovery and study of dark matter. We report the results of a pathfinder dark photon dark matter cavity search experiment performed at Hunan Normal University and the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, representing the first stage of the APEX (Axion and dark Photon EXperiment) program. Finding no statistically significant excess, we place an upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter $|\chi|&lt;3.7\times 10^{-13}$ around $m_A\simeq 29.5$ $\mu$eV at 90% confidence level. This result exceeds other constraints on dark photon dark matter in this frequency range by roughly an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Muon neutrinos and the cosmological abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the mixed dark matter scenarios consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particle dark matter (DM), PBHs can accrete surrounding DM particles to form ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs or clothed PBHs) even at an early epoch of the Universe. The distribution of DM particles in a UCMH follows a steeper density profile compared with a classical DM halo. It is expected that the DM annihilation rate is very large in UCMHs, resulting in a contribution to, e.g., the extragalactic neutrino flux. In this work, we investigate the extragalactic neutrino flux from clothed PBHs due to DM annihilation, and then the muon flux for neutrino detection. Compared with the atmospheric neutrino flux, we derive the upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs for 10 years of exposure time of, e.g., the IceCube experiment. Compared with other constraints, although the upper limits obtained by us are not the strongest, it is a different way to study the cosmological abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Gravitational Waves from SU(2) Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study detection prospects of a gravitational-wave background (GWB) sourced by SU(2) gauge fields considering all possible observational constraints. More precisely, we consider bounds set by cosmic microwave background measurements, primordial black hole overproduction, as well as backreaction of the gauge fields on the background evolution. Gravitational-waves data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration show no evidence for a GWB contribution from axion inflation. However, we are able to place conservative constraints on the parameters of the SU(2) inflation with current data. We investigate conditions on the inflationary potential that would lead to a detectable signal that evades astrophysical and cosmological constraints and discuss detection prospects for third generation networks.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from the form factor bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The form-factor bootstrap is incomplete until one normalizes the zero-particle form factor. For the stress energy tensor we describe how to obtain the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} | 0 \rangle = \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, from the form-factor bootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this prescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained in a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We propose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\rho_{\rm vac} \propto m^D/\mathfrak{g}$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix. In the limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac} $ diverges due to well understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the the observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist a particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak sector, which we designate as the "zeron". A strong candidate for the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the branching fraction of $D^+_s\to \ell^+\nu_\ell$ via $e^+e^-\to D^{*+}_{s} D^{*-}_{s}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on $10.64~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at center-of-mass energies between 4.237 and 4.699 GeV with the BESIII detector, we study the leptonic $D^+_s$ decays using the $e^+e^-\to D^{*+}_{s} D^{*-}_{s}$ process. The branching fractions of $D_s^+\to\ell^+\nu_{\ell}\,(\ell=\mu,\tau)$ are measured to be $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu)=(0.547\pm0.026_{\rm stat}\pm0.016_{\rm syst})\%$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\tau^+\nu_\tau)=(5.60\pm0.16_{\rm stat}\pm0.20_{\rm syst})\%$, respectively. The product of the decay constant and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is determined to be $f_{D_s^+}|V_{cs}|=(246.5\pm5.9_{\rm stat}\pm3.6_{\rm syst}\pm0.5_{\rm input})_{\mu\nu}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $f_{D_s^+}|V_{cs}|=(252.7\pm3.6_{\rm stat}\pm4.5_{\rm syst}\pm0.6_{\rm input}))_{\tau \nu}~\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. Taking the value of $|V_{cs}|$ from a global fit in the Standard Model, we obtain ${f_{D^+_s}}=(252.8\pm6.0_{\rm stat}\pm3.7_{\rm syst}\pm0.6_{\rm input})_{\mu\nu}$ MeV and ${f_{D^+_s}}=(259.2\pm3.6_{\rm stat}\pm4.5_{\rm syst}\pm0.6_{\rm input})_{\tau \nu}$ MeV, respectively. Conversely, taking the value for $f_{D_s^+}$ from the latest lattice quantum chromodynamics calculation, we obtain $|V_{cs}| =(0.986\pm0.023_{\rm stat}\pm0.014_{\rm syst}\pm0.003_{\rm input})_{\mu\nu}$ and $|V_{cs}| = (1.011\pm0.014_{\rm stat}\pm0.018_{\rm syst}\pm0.003_{\rm input})_{\tau \nu}$, respectively.</description>
