      <title>Visualizing interaction-driven restructuring of quantum Hall edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases, including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Dragging of electric current by hydrodynamic flow at charge neutrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of drag in graphene double layers near charge neutrality. We work in the regime of electron hydrodynamics and account for interlayer correlations of charge puddle disorder. The drag resistivity is expressed in terms of the viscosity, intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, and the correlation function of the puddle disorder. The contributions of the interlayer transfer of momentum and energy to drag have opposite signs. This leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the drag resistivity on the carrier density. For layer-symmetric doping, the drag resistivity changes sign as a function of the carrier density. At interlayer separations shorter than the disorder correlation length, the transconductivity saturates to the disorder-induced enhancement of the intralayer conductivity. We provide quantitative estimates of the effect for Dirac electron liquids in monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene double-layer devices.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity-induced bulk localization with self similarity in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian lattice subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics of nano-oscillators with dual vortex free layers mutually coupled via spin-torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) have been shown to exhibit rich and complex dynamical regimes, which are strongly dependent on the polarizer's configuration. Here, we give an overview of the dynamics in an STVO comprising two vortex free layers, where each layer serves as a dynamic polarizer for the other, increasing the number of degrees of freedom and therefore, the complexity of the system. The dynamics are studied through extensive micromagnetic simulations, performed using our own implementation of the coupled equations of motion, implemented in the open-source micromagnetics code Mumax3. We explore the roles of relative vortex configurations and layer asymmetry on the current-driven dynamics, and find several complex regimes, including self-modulated gyration, the emergence of C-state dynamics, as well as chaotic transitions between regular gyration and this C-state.</description>

      <title>Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, we show that coupling via a parity-flipping operator ($\gamma_L$) to a broadband bosonic environment yields a decoherence rate scaling as $\Gamma \propto \rho(\epsilon)/\epsilon$, where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is the environmental density of states at the qubit splitting energy $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$. By designing environments with suppressed density of states at low frequencies (e.g., using photonic bandgap materials or Josephson junction arrays), we achieve an ''inverse Purcell effect'' that leads to a suppression factor $F_P \propto (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$, dramatically reducing decoherence. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization. Our work establishes environmental engineering as a powerful approach for enhancing topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Accessing Energetically Restricted Optical Transitions in a Single Free-Base Porphyrin Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the electronic properties of single atoms, molecules, and nanostructures is the hallmark of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, exploration of a complex manifold of nonequilibrium many-body electron configurations has been enabled by the development of STM electroluminescence methods (STML). STML provides access to optical properties of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between many-body states that obey energy conservation. Insufficient charge attachment energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to gain access to optically excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.</description>

      <title>Charged impurity scattering in two-dimensional topological insulators with Mexican-hat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering by charged impurities is known to mainly determine transport properties of electrons in modern quantum materials, but it remains poorly studied for materials with Mexican hat dispersion. Due to such nontrivial features as a singular density of states and a ring-shaped Fermi surface, electron-electron interaction and electron transitions between different isoenergetic contours are of key importance in this materials. We show that these factors significantly affect both the spatial profile of the screened potential of Coulomb centers and the dependence of mobility on temperature and electron density. The screened potential is calculated within the random phase approximation. The transport properties are determined without using the usual relaxation time approximation, since the distribution function in energy space is a vector defined by a system of two equations.</description>

      <title>Negative dynamic conductance of a quantum wire with unscreened Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic conductance and time-of-flight current instability in a quantum wire connected to electron reservoirs under DC bias voltage are studied in the absence of a gate screening the Coulomb interaction of electrons. Due to a strong electron-electron interaction, dramatic rearrangements of the charge density distribution and the potential landscape in the wire occur at a sufficiently high DC bias voltage. The applied voltage is screened mainly near the cathode contact, and an almost flat potential profile is established in the most of the wire. Thus, the size of the region of a population inversion of electronic states greatly increases, and the band of wave vectors that form unstable modes of electronic waves significantly reduces. As a result, the conditions for the occurrence of the time-of-flight instability are greatly facilitated and the negative dynamic conductivity increases.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00688v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</description>

      <title>Exchange operation of Majorana zero modes in topological insulator-based Josephson trijunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes are anyons obeying non-Abelian exchange statistics distinct from fermions or bosons. While significant progresses have been achieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in solid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive proof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation. This work would establish a critical pathway toward ultimately braiding Majorana zero modes in the Fu-Kane scheme of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Moir\'e Higher-Order Topology Beyond Effective Moir\'e Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moir\'e lattice models. While conventional models treat moir\'e sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moir\'e site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moir\'e materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moir\'e site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moir\'e higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moir\'e hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moir\'e higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moir\'e platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied interference dislocations (forks) adjacent to an emission spot in an interference pattern. The adjacent interference dislocations are observed in emission of excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide and in emission of spatially indirect excitons, also known as interlayer excitons, in a van der Waals heterostructure. The simulations show that the adjacent interference dislocations appear due to the moir\'e effect in combined interference patterns produced by constituting parts of the emission spot. The adjacent interference dislocations can appear in interference images for various spatially modulated emission patterns.</description>

      <title>Interaction of moire-induced quantum Hall channels in a locally gated graphene junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating electron quantum 1D channels is an important element in the field of quantum information due to their ballistic and phase coherence properties. In GaAs and graphene based two dimensional gas systems, these edge channels have been investigated with both integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, contributing to the realization of electron interferometer and anyon braiding. Often, at the p-n junction in the quantum Hall (QH) regime, the presence of a depletion region due to a band gap or the formation of gaps between the zeroth Landau levels (zLL) suppresses interaction between the co-propagating edge channels of opposing doping regimes and helps to preserve the phase coherence of the channels. Here, we observe a new type of p-n junction in hexagonal boron nitride aligned graphene that lacks both the zLL and band gap. In this system, a van Hove singularity (vHS) emerges at the p-n junctions under magnetic fields of several Tesla, owing to the doping inversion near the secondary Dirac point. By fabricating devices with independently tunable global bottom and local top gates, we enable the study of interactions between p-type and n-type QH edge channels through magnetic breakdown associated with the vHS. These findings provide valuable insights into the interactions of superlattice-induced QH edge channels in hBN-aligned graphene.</description>

      <title>Local thermodynamic DOS measurement and twist-angle mapping in graphene-hBN superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Atomically Flat Monocrystalline Gold Flakes: Recent Advances, Applications, and Future Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High aspect ratio oblate polygonal gold crystals - such as triangular and hexagonal platelets - have attracted considerable interest due to their extraordinary physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Commonly referred to as "gold flakes," these structures exhibit atomically flat surfaces, $\mu$m$^2$ areas with nanometric thickness, and a monocrystalline morphology. Since their first discovery by John Turkevich in 1951, considerable progress has been made in shape-controlled synthesis and large-scale production, unlocking steadily new opportunities for ever more advanced applications. This review explores large-area gold flakes with lateral dimensions spanning from hundreds of nanometers to millimeters, emphasizing their unique properties. We provide a comprehensive overview of key developments, from early discoveries, synthesis approaches, and fabrication techniques to recent breakthroughs. Emphasis is placed on the integration of gold flake as functional building blocks in photonics (e.g., for nanoantennas), sensing, nanoelectronics, biomedicine, and beyond. We conclude with a discussion of emerging roles and future developments of this unique class of materials.</description>

      <title>Robust structural superlubricity of twisted graphene bilayer and domain walls between commensurate moir\'e pattern domains from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding. Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction for commensurate moir\'e systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming moir\'e patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1) pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that different from aligned graphene layers, for moir\'e patterns, PES minima and maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate domains, each comprising a large number of moir\'e pattern unit cells, and provide estimates of their characteristics.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned tuning to protected states by probing noise resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protected states are promising for quantum technologies due to their intrinsic resilience against noise. However, such states often emerge at discrete points or small regions in parameter space and are thus difficult to find in experiments. In this work, we present a machine-learning method for tuning to protected regimes, based on injecting noise into the system and searching directly for the most noise-resilient configuration. We illustrate this method by considering short quantum dot-based Kitaev chains which we subject to random parameter fluctuations. Using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy we minimize the typical resulting ground state splitting, which makes the system converge to a protected configuration with well-separated Majorana bound states. We verify the robustness of our method by considering finite Zeeman fields, electron-electron repulsion, asymmetric couplings, and varying the length of the Kitaev chain. Our work provides a reliable method for tuning to protected states, including but not limited to isolated Majorana bound states.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials, offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport fingerprints of tunable Fermi-arc connectivity in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals provide a unique platform for surface-state engineering, yet di rectly tracking of their evolution under surface tuning remains experimentally challenging. Here we
  theoretically propose that nonreciprocal charge transport can serve as a direct probe of Fermi arc
  Lifshitz transitions (FALT). We show that different surface terminations in Co3Sn2S2 can produce
  f
  inite and highly tunable second-order nonreciprocal signals, which can be further modulated by
  adjusting the surface potential. Strikingly, we show that the second-order conductivity exhibits sign
  changes as the Fermi arc connectivity is tuned across FALT driven by gating or chemical potential
  variation. This behavior arises from the chiral nature of electron velocities on the Fermi arcs, and is
  highly sensitive to surface termination and symmetry breaking. Our findings establish nonreciprocal
  transport as an electrically measurable fingerprint of FALT and propose new strategies that could be
  directly applied in devices for in situ engineering and detecting transport properties in topological
  materials.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance as detection of low-damping magnon pairs: Theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality magnetic sphere under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe a \textit{Fano resonance} in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. When the drive frequency is very close to the ferromagnetic resonance, the microwave transmission splits into two absorption dips. We interpret the unexpected Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. When the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ is much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation can well reproduce the observed Fano resonance. Mode fluctuations with a low damping should be useful for quantum information and logic operations in future magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional relativistic spin polarization of electronic bands in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently identified phase with a d, g or i-wave spin symmetry of magnetic ordering. Its discovery opens new research fronts at intersections of magnetism and spintronics with fields ranging from superconductivity to topological and relativistic quantum physics. Here we demonstrate an unconventional relativistic spin polarization in an altermagnet by spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electronic bands in single-domain MnTe. The relativistic spin-orbit coupling origin is revealed by observing that the alternating momentum-dependent spin polarization is orthogonal to the magnetic-ordering vector. The collinearity, even-parity and time-reversal-odd nature of the demonstrated relativistic spin polarization in the altermagnet is unparalleled in conventional forms of the relativistic spin polarization. Our experimental results and methodology are supported by non-relativistic spin-symmetry and relativistic magnetic-symmetry analyses, and microscopic ab initio ground-state and photoemission theory.</description>

      <title>Phason-driven temperature-dependent transport in moir\'e graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and vibrational properties of 2D materials are dramatically altered by the formation of a moir\'e superlattice. The lowest-energy phonon modes of the superlattice are two acoustic branches (called phasons) that describe the sliding motion of one layer with respect to the other. Considering their low-energy dispersion and damping, these modes may act as a significant source of scattering for electrons in moir\'e materials. Here, we investigate temperature-dependent electrical transport in minimally twisted bilayer graphene, a moir\'e system developing multiple weakly-dispersive electronic bands and a reconstructed lattice structure. We measure a linear-in-temperature resistivity across the band manyfold above $T\sim{10}$ K, preceded by a quadratic temperature dependence. While the linear-in-temperature resistivity is up to two orders of magnitude larger than in monolayer graphene, it is reduced (approximately by a factor of three) with respect to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Moreover, it is modulated by the recursive band filling, with minima located close to the full filling of each band. Comparing our results with a semiclassical transport calculation, we show that the experimental trends are compatible with scattering processes mediated by longitudinal phasons, which dominate the resistivity over the contribution from conventional acoustic phonons of the monolayer. Our findings highlight the close relation between vibrational modes unique to moir\'e materials and carrier transport therein.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Raman Scattering under Vibrational Strong Coupling: The Critical Role of Polariton Spatial Mode Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly coupled quasi-2d systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency admittance and noise of a helical edge coupled to a magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange coupling of the helical edge state of a quantum spin-Hall insulator with an easy-plane magnet has no effect on its DC electrical conductance if the magnet's anisotropy axis is aligned with the spin quantization axis of the helical edge state [Meng et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 205403 (2014)]. We here calculate the AC conductance $G_V(\omega)$ and the noise power $S_V(\omega)$ in the presence of a DC bias $V$. While both take the universal values $G_V({\omega = 0}) = e^2/h$ and $S_V(\omega = 0) = 4 e^2 k_{\rm B} T/h$ in the zero-frequency limit, $G_V(\omega)$ and $S_V(\omega)$ are quickly suppressed for finite $\omega$, so that low-frequency transport is effectively noiseless.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation and Optical Manipulation of Exciton-polariton Parametric Scattering Lasing in Temporal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid light-matter character of exciton-polaritons gives rise to distinct polariton parametric scattering (PPS) process, which holds promise for frontier applications in polaritonic quantum devices. However, the stable excitation and coherent optical manipulation of PPS remain challenging due to scattering bottlenecks and rapid dephasing effect in polariton many-body systems. In this study, we first report the direct observation and optical amplification of non-degenerate intermode PPS lasing at room temperature (RT). The specific polariton branch of strong-coupled nanobelt planar microcavity is resonantly excited by a near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser via two-photon absorption (TPA) scheme, and the non-degenerate signal- and idler-states are stimulated. Angle-resolved dispersion patterns clearly reveal the evolution of the pump-, signal-, and idler-states under different excitation powers. Based on our self-constructed ultrafast femtosecond resonant optical trigger set-up, a selective enhancement and modulation of the signal-state is realized. Furthermore, the dynamic measurements of nonlinear signal-state enhancement process demonstrate a sub-picosecond response time (0.4ps), confirming its potential for ultrafast optical manipulation. Our work establishes a platform for exploring TPA-driven PPS laser and provides a novel optical modulation route for polariton-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Roughness of Freestanding Oxide Membranes Revealed by Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freestanding oxide films offer significant potential for integrating exotic quantum functionalities with semiconductor technologies. However, their performance is critically limited by surface roughness and interfacial imperfection caused by dangling bonds, which disrupt coherent interactions and suppress quantum phenomena at heterointerfaces. To address the challenge of structural characterization of surfaces and interfaces, we develop a metrological approach achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin oxide heterostructures leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from multislice electron ptychography. This method also allows for counting the number of atoms, even including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory in electron microscopy, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view of measurement geometry, allowing for large field-of-view imaging, provides remarkably rich information and high statistics about the atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis provides unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance, offering critical insights for engineering robust heterointerfaces in next-generation oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in lattices in presence of bulk dephasing and a localized source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Gate Dielectric Engineering with an Ultrathin Silicon-oxide Interfacial Dipole Layer for Low-Leakage Oxide-Semiconductor Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a gate dielectric engineering approach leveraging an ultrathin, atomic layer deposited (ALD) silicon oxide interfacial layer (SiL) between the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel and the high-k gate dielectric. SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (V$_T$) of AOS transistors, providing at least four distinct $V_T$ levels with a maximum increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable $V_T$ control without significantly degrading critical device parameters such as mobility, on-state current, all while keeping the process temperature below 225 $^{\circ}$C and requiring no additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature instability tests at 85 $^{\circ}$C indicate a significant reduction in negative $V_{T}$ shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell (GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage ($V_{SN}$) (reduces $V_{SN}$ drop by 67\%), by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to baseline device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing magnetic coupling in lumped element superconducting resonators for molecular spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Point-contact enhanced superconductivity in trigonal PtBi2: quest for the origin of high-Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied enhanced superconductivity in point contacts (PCs) based on a type-I Weyl semimetal t-PtBi2 using both normal metal (Ag, Cu, Pt) and ferromagnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) tips by measuring the differential resistance dV/dI(V) curves. In most cases, the value of the superconducting critical temperature Tc ranges between 3 and 5 K, which is several times higher than the maximal bulk Tc. At the same time, among dozens of PCs with higher Tc, a few of them reach Tc up to 8 K, including those with both normal and ferromagnetic tips. The critical magnetic field is also highly enhanced in PCs and reaches up to several Tesla. The common reason for the Tc increase may be related to pressure/strain caused at the PC's formation. Moreover, a greater increase in Tc is observed for PCs formed at the edge of the sample flake than for those formed on the plane. The results also reveal that the growth of Tc in PCs based on t-PtBi2 is compatible with ferromagnetism in Fe, Co, and Ni tips, initiating discussion as to the possible non-trivial nature of enhanced superconductivity. Anyway, our findings suggest that t-PtBi2 is a promising candidate for realizing topological superconductivity at more accessible temperatures</description>

      <title>Glass Patterns in Twisted Disordered Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisting and stacking two copies of a 2D crystal can produce a long-wavelength periodic interference pattern known as a moir\'e pattern. Performing the same procedure with an aperiodic structure instead generates a single moir\'e spot at the rotation center, known as a Glass pattern. We explore the implications of these patterns across a variety of models: they allow measurement of microscopic parameters from mesoscopic resistivity measurements; they generate an impurity that modifies the properties of a moir\'e lattice at the rotation center; and they allow for domain formation in amorphous magnets. These results establish Glass patterns as a generic feature of twisted disordered systems and provide a framework for future theoretical and experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Sensing in Liquid Using Fluorescent h-BN Point Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex systems. However, sensing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. A strategy is introduced that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as single ion sensors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm were observed upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Through this approach, individual point defects were shown to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electrical field, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct sensing of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to 10 micromolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Evidence of anisotropic three-dimensional weak-localization in TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ is a typical transition-metal dichalcogenide known for its charge-density wave order. In this study, we report the observation of an unusual anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in exfoliated TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes at low temperatures. Unlike the negative magnetoresistance reported in most other transition-metal dichalcogenides, our results cannot be explained by either the conventional two-dimensional weak localization effect or the Kondo effect. A comprehensive analysis of the data suggests that the observed anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in TiSe$_2$ flakes is most likely caused by the three-dimensional weak localization effect. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase-coherent transport processes in TiSe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present unconventional nodal crossings in a two-dimensional (2D) collinear altermagnet, which are enforced by crystal symmetries to lock spin polarization and valley degrees of freedom. The altermagnetism generate nonrelativistic spin-splitting in honeycomb antiferromagnets, guaranteeing novel band degeneracies between bands sharing identical spin configurations yet different sublattices. Inspired by the $XPS_{3}$ (X=Mn, Fe, Ni) materials, we demonstrate distinctive Berry curvature distributions concentrating intensely at Weyl nodes, which further generalize the locking between valleys and Berry curvature. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands, where degeneracy lifting contributes to unconventional spin textures to induce the valley Hall effect. Our results yield unique topological nodes via leveraging the crystal symmetry constraints with the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking, where corresponding topological responses enable the potential of advancing spintronics. Our results yield unique topological nodes without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) achieved by combining crystal symmetry constraints with inherent time-reversal symmetry breaking, whose associated topological responses enable promising applications in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Two-mode Floquet Redfield quantum master approach for quantum transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous driving by two periodic oscillations yields a practical technique for further engineering quantum systems. For quantum transport through mesoscopic systems driven by two strong periodic terms, a non-perturbative Floquet-based quantum master equation (QME) approach is developed using a set of dissipative time-dependent terms and the reduced density matrix of the system. This work extends our previous Floquet approach for transport through quantum dots (at finite temperature and arbitrary bias) driven periodically by a single frequency. In a pedagogical way, we derive explicit time-dependent dissipative terms. Our theory begins with the derivation of the two-mode Floquet Liouville-von Neumann equation. We then explain the second-order Wangsness-Bloch-Redfield QME with a slightly modified definition of the interaction picture. Subsequently, the two-mode Shirley time evolution formula is applied, allowing for the integration of reservoir dynamics. Consequently, the established formalism has a wide range of applications in open quantum systems driven by two modes in the weak coupling regime. The formalism's potential applications are demonstrated through various examples.</description>

Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field and was later generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model, all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this phenomenon to the energetic separation of nonquantized Berry fluxes within those bands. Adding disorder then nudges the system into a quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window inside a trivial band. This natural integer-rounding mechanism manifests as the mobility-gap-induced quantization of a nonuniversal Hall conductance. Our results are corroborated by numerical transport simulations and the analysis of two complementary topological markers.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</description>

      <title>Novel SuperLattice Plasmon Mode in a Grating of 2D Electron Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure membranes with a metasurface made up of a grating of two-dimensional electron system (2DES) strips. Experiments have revealed a strong plasma resonance in the transmission of the metasurface. We have found that a collective effect from the superlattice, along with lateral screening between the strips, leads to the emergence of a new plasmon mode in the metasurface under study. Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of the discovered superlattice plasmon mode, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic metasurface systems.</description>

Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents. In contrast, circularly polarized light can not induce shift or injection currents, as constrained by the three-fold rotation symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is shown in the Haldane model. Under linearly polarized light, shift current, allowed by time-reversal symmetry, flows perpendicularly to the injection current, allowed by $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign since the group velocity's sign remains unchanged. On the contrary, shift current shows a sign flip, as a result of band inversion. Furthermore, we calculate quantum geometry, including quantum metric and symplectic connection, to demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE. We found that the vector field of symplectic connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low-power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We use selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires to realize scalable and planar nanowire device geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate effectively in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Confined Bulk Plasmons in metallic nanoparticles by penetrating electron beams within a non-local analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a linear hydrodynamic model (HDM) we investigate theoretically the interaction between penetrating electron beams and sub-5 nm metallic spherical nanoparticles (NPs), and provide an analytical expression of the electron energy loss (EEL) probability including non-local effects in the response of the confined electron gas. We focus on the characterization of the longitudinal plasmon excitations, or confined bulk plasmons (CBPs), which cannot be addressed within local dielectric frameworks, and show that their excitation is highly sensitive to the impact parameter and kinetic energy of the incident electron beam, as well as to the NP's size. In contrast to the local approach, our decription captures a blueshift of the bulk plasmon envelope (BPE) with decreasing NP size and a blueshift with increasing impact parameter. Moreover, it predicts a threshold impact parameter, or minimum electron path inside the NP, to efficiently activate a set of CBPs. Exploiting the multipolar description of the CBPs we identify the underlying symmetry rules governing their excitation by electron beams, and correlate the observed blueshift of the BPE for increasing impact parameters with the excitation of higher-order CBPs. Dispersion of the CBPs with decreasing NP sizes further increases this impact parameter dependent blueshift of the BPE and also explains the decrease in the impact parameter threshold.</description>

      <title>Toward a Deterministic Nucleation Theory for Chirality-Controlled Nanotube Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are dictated by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The absence of a predictive theory directly linking catalysts to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here we narrow this gap through a two-step approach. First, we derive a universal vector sum rule that quantifies the relationship between cap structure and chirality, demonstrating that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the vector sum of the six pentagon coordinates within the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. Building on this topological foundation, we establish that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as perturbations to pentagon positions lead to predictable, quantifiable, and kinetically irreversible shifts in (n,m). By examining existing experimental evidence, we further propose that the preferential formation of $(12,6)$ nanotubes arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the &lt;1,1,1&gt; catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Quantum Toroidal Dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of matter is governed by three fundamental multipole families: electric, magnetic, and toroidal. While the electric and magnetic are cornerstones of physics, the toroidal dipole (TD) has eluded direct, quantitative measurement for over 60 years. Its far-field signature is masked by the electric dipole, and its behavior in the quantum regime remains largely unexplored. We address this long-standing problem by presenting a complete quantum-mechanical formalism for the TD in a nanostructure and proposing the first spectroscopic method for its direct measurement. We analyze a particle confined to a toroidal manifold subjected to an external current. We demonstrate that the resulting Aharonov-Bohm-like energy shifts in the system's spectrum are directly proportional to the expectation value of the TD operator. The transition energies exhibit a linear dependence on this current, with a quantized slope that directly reveals the change in the TD quantum number between eigenstates. This provides a clear experimental blueprint to unveil, measure, and characterize this elusive third multipole moment and its quantum nature, opening new avenues in quantum metamaterials, nanoscience, and the study of fundamental symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</description>

      <title>How Do Proteins Fold?</title>

Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>
