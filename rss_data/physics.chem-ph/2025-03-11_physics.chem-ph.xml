      <title>Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Multireference Configuration Interaction for Ground and Excited Vibronic States and Fundamental Insights into Multicomponent Basis Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach incorporates nuclear quantum effects into quantum chemistry calculations by treating specified nuclei quantum mechanically, equivalently to the electrons. Within the NEO framework, excited states are vibronic states representing electronic and nuclear vibrational excitations. The NEO multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method presented herein provides accurate ground and excited vibronic states. The electronic and nuclear orbitals are optimized with a NEO multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NEO-MCSCF) procedure, thereby including both static and dynamic correlation and allowing the description of double and higher excitations. The accuracy of the NEO-MRCI method is illustrated by computing the ground state protonic densities and excitation energies of the vibronic states for four molecular systems with the hydrogen nucleus treated quantum mechanically. In addition, revised conventional electronic basis sets adapted for quantized nuclei are developed and shown to be essential for achieving this level of accuracy. The NEO-MRCI approach, as well as the strategy for revising electronic basis sets, will play a critical role in multicomponent quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Amyloid Self-Assembly on Magnetic Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein aggregation into insoluble amyloid-like fibrils is implicated in a wide range of diseases and understanding its nucleation process is a key for mechanistic insights and advancing therapeutics. The electronic charge of the amyloidogenic monomers significantly influences their self-assembly process. However, the impact of electron spin interactions between monomers on amyloid nucleation has not been considered yet. Here, we studied amyloid formation on magnetic substrates using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), fluorescence microscopy, and Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy. We observed a preferred magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic layer for fibril formation, leading to twice as many and significantly longer fibrils (up to 20 times) compared to the opposite magnetization orientation. This preference is related to monomer chirality. Additionally, fibril structure varied with substrate magnetization orientation. Our findings suggest a transient spin polarization in monomers during self-assembly, driven by the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect. These effects are consistent for various molecule length scales, from A-beta polypeptide to dipeptides and single amino acids, indicating a fundamental spin-based dependence on biomolecular aggregation that could be applied in novel therapeutic interventions targeted for amyloid-related diseases.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Embedding Based Multi-Configurational Perturbation Theory Approach to Single-Ion Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-configurational wave-function theory (MC-WFT) that combines complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach with subsequent state interaction (SI) treatment of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), abbreviated as CASSCF-SO, plays important roles in microscopic understanding of single-ion magnets (SIMs) with different central transition metal or lanthanide ions and various coordination environments, but its application to SIMs with complex structure is severely limited due to its highly demanding computational cost. Density-matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a systematic and mathematically rigorous framework to combine low-level mean field approaches like Hartree-Fock and high-level MC-WFT methods like CASSCF-SO, which is particularly promising to SIMs. As a continuation of our previous work on DMET+CASSCF for $3d$ SIMs (Ai, Sun, and Jiang, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 10627), we extend the methodology by considering dynamic correlation on top of CASSCF using the second-order $n$-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) in the DMET framework, abbreviated as DMET+NEVPT2, and benchmark the accuracy of this approach to molecular magnetic anisotropy in a set of typical transition metal complexes. We found that DMET+NEVPT2 can give the results very close to all-electron treatment, and can be systematically improved for higher accuracy by expanding the region treated as the central cluster, while the computation cost is dramatically reduced due to the reduction of the number of orbitals by DMET construction. Our findings suggest that DMET is capable of accounting for most of the dynamic correlation that is important for magnetic anisotropy in typical SIMs, and can be useful for further high-accuracy spin-phonon study and high-throughput computations.</description>

      <title>Correlated vibration-solvent and Duschinsky effects on optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of vibrations in optical spectroscopies is essential for the precise interpretation of spectroscopic behavior, especially in systems with complex solvation effects. This workstudies the correlated Duschinsky and solvent effects on the optical spectra using the extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion (ext-DEOM) approach, which is an exact and non-Markovian, nonperturbative approach for nonlinear environmental couplings. In the paper, the environment (bath) is composed of the solvent and intramolecular vibrational modes whose Duschinsky rotations constitute the quardratic couplings to the electronic states. To apply the ext-DEOM, one key step is to obtain the bath coupling descriptors, which is elaborated. As an accurate description of solvated molecular systems, the simulating results demonstrate how the above factors affect the position and shape of spectral bands.</description>

      <title>Vib2Mol: from vibrational spectra to molecular structures-a versatile deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There will be a paradigm shift in chemical and biological research, to be enabled by autonomous, closed-loop, real-time self-directed decision-making experimentation. Spectrum-to-structure correlation, which is to elucidate molecular structures with spectral information, is the core step in understanding the experimental results and to close the loop. However, current approaches usually divide the task into either database-dependent retrieval and database-independent generation and neglect the inherent complementarity between them. In this study, we proposed Vib2Mol, a general deep learning model designed to flexibly handle diverse spectrum-to-structure tasks according to the available prior knowledge by bridging the retrieval and generation. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, even for the most demanding Raman spectra, over previous models in predicting reaction products and sequencing peptides as well as analyzing experimental spectra and integrating multi-modal spectral data. Vib2Mol enables vibrational spectroscopy a real-time guide for autonomous scientific discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization of large molecular systems with VTX: example with a minimal whole-cell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at \href{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}. VTX source code is available at \href{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}.</description>

      <title>Multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating quantum dynamical simulations with quantum computing has received considerable attention but remains a significant challenge. In variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, designing an expressive and shallow-depth parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is a key difficulty. Here, we proposed a multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm (MS-VQD) tailored for nonadiabatic dynamics involving multiple electronic states. MS-VQD employs multiple PQCs to represent the electronic-nuclear coupled wavefunction, with each circuit adapting to the motion of nuclear wavepacket on a specific potential energy surface. By simulating excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates described by the Frenkel-Holstein model, we demonstrated that MS-VQD achieves the same accuracy as traditional VQD while requiring significantly shallower PQCs. Notably, its advantage increases with the number of electronic states, making it suitable for simulating nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Laser fluence-dependent production of molecular thorium ions in different charge states for trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thorium ions and molecules, recognized for their distinctive nuclear and atomic attributes, are central to numerous trapped-ion experiments globally. Our study introduces an effective, compact source of thorium ions produced via laser ablation of microgram-scale, salt-based samples. We thoroughly analyze the variety of ion species and charge states generated at varying laser fluences. Utilizing 10$\mu$g of thorium fluoride crystals and laser fluences between $100 - 700$ J$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ we produce thorium molecular ions $^{232}$ThF$_x$$^{n+}$ (with $x= 0 - 3$ and charge states up to $n = 3+$), including ThF$^{2+}$ and ThF$^{3+}$. These species are particularly relevant for spectroscopy; ThF$^{3+}$ is valuable for its stable closed-shell configuration, while ThF$^{2+}$, which is isoelectronic to RaF, offers a unique probe for studying nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries due to its simple electronic structure with a single unpaired electron. Density functional theory calculations of the distribution of positive charge in the produced molecular cations and the simplicity of this setup indicate that this method is easily transferable to other actinide systems.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Reaction Products from Generic Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Temporal Phase-Resolved Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy in Molecules with Lock-in Enabled Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an experiment to measure the emitted real-time electric field from an ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical interaction in molecules, using a phase-tracked spectral interferometry scheme. By combining a software lock-in amplification based spectrometer with spectral interferometry, we measure the electric field of the nonlinear optical signal from rotationally excited gas-phase molecules. The lock-in spectrometer allows selective measurement of signals of interest with improved signal-to-noise ratio, while rejecting any unwanted incoherent background. The nonlinear optical signal interferes with a known reference pulse on the spectrometer, which allows measurement of ultraweak signal electric fields. Further, we show that lock-in detection enables correction of slow interferometric drifts by utilizing a multidimensional measurement space. Thus, interferometric stability is achieved without the need for active stabilization, which typically utilizes an independent phase drift measurement. We present data from an experiment in impulsively aligned molecules that demonstrates the important features of our scheme. The scheme can be applied to study ultrafast dynamics in laser excited systems in the gas, liquid, and solid phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Radical chemical reactions on cosmic dust grains play a crucial role in forming various chemical species. Among different radicals, the hydroxyl (OH) is one of the most important ones, with a rather specific chemistry. Aims. The goal of this work is to simulate the recombination dynamics of hydroxyl radicals and the subsequent formation of hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$). Mthods. We employed neural network potentials trained on ONIOM(QM/QM) data, combining multi-reference (CASPT2) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This approach allows us to model the recombination of hydroxyl radicals on ice surfaces with high computational efficiency and accuracy. Results. Our simulations reveal that the initial position of the radicals plays a decisive role in determining recombination probability. We found that the formation of hydrogen-bond between radicals, competes with the formation of hydrogen peroxide, reducing the recombination efficiency, contrary to expectancy. This competition reduces the recombination probability for radicals that are initially formed approximately 3 \AA{} apart. Recombination probabilities also depend on the kinetic energy of the added radicals, with values around 0.33 for thermal radicals and a wide range of values between 0.33 and 1.00 for suprathermal OH radicals. Conclusions. Based on our calculations we provide recommendations for introducing OH radical recombination into kinetic astrochemical models, differentiating between thermal and suprathermal radicals. The recombination behavior varies significantly between these two cases: while thermal radicals are sometimes trapped in hydrogen-bonded minima, the case of suprathermal radicals varies with the added energy. Our most important conclusion is that OH radical recombination probability cannot be assumed 1.0 for a wide variety of cases.</description>

      <title>Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

Abstract: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Plane-Wave Approach to Generalized Kohn-Sham Density-Functional Theory of Solids with Mixed Deterministic/Stochastic Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient mixed deterministic/sparse-stochastic plane-wave approach is developed for bandstructure calculations of large supercell periodic generalized-Kohn-Sham density functional theory, for any hybrid-exchange density functional. The method works for very large elementary cells and supercells, and we benchmark it on covalently bonded solids and molecular crystals with nonbonded interactions, for supercells of up to 33,000 atoms. Memory and CPU requirements scale with supercell size quasi-linearly.</description>

      <title>Liquid water under vibrational strong coupling: an extended cavity Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computational study of liquid water when the system is coupled with a (model) Fabry-Perot cavity is reported. At this end, the Cavity Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics approach proposed recently (Li et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 2020, 117, 18324-18331) is employed and different properties of water under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) are investigated. Different cavity frequencies were considered, corresponding to different modes in the IR spectrum of liquid water: high frequency (corresponding to O-H stretching modes), medium frequency (corresponding to water molecule bending) and low frequencies (corresponding to librational modes). Simulations were done both using classical and quantum nuclear dynamics, this last with Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics methods. Similar effect of the cavity are obtained in both cases. Namely, whereas the splitting of the infrared spectrum is obtained for all cavity frequencies, no effect on structural properties are obtained. Also transport and dynamical properties, including the diffusion coefficient, hydrogen bond (HB) relaxation and HB jump exchange times show no effect when coupled to the cavity and when an extended statistical analysis is performed. This lack of effect may be due to the model's inability to account for bond breaking or the absence of molecular polarizability.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of polyacetylene: Exploring electronic correlation effects through first-principles modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyacetylene, a simple yet fascinating polymer, has been of great interest for its unique electronic properties. However, the role of electronic correlation effects in polyacetylene still has not been explored fully on an ab initio basis. Using density functional theory (DFT) and a range of exchange-correlation functionals -- including GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals -- we demonstrate that correlation effects can possibly stabilize a magnetic state as a competing order on the $\pi$-conjugated carbon $p$ orbitals. Our study highlights the complexity of physics of polyacetylene and suggests similarities with the physics of the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Complex potential energy surfaces: gradients with projected CAP technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique is one of the commonly used Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approaches for characterizing electronic resonances. CAP combined with various electronic structure methods has shown promising results in quantifying the energies and widths of electronic resonances in molecular systems. While CAP-based methods can be used to map complex potential energy surfaces for resonance states, efficient exploration of these surfaces, e.g. geometry optimization or dynamical simulations, require information on the nuclear gradient. Currently, the only nuclear gradients available for CAP-based methods are for Hartree-Fock and Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster method with single and double excitations (J. Chem. Phys. 146, 031101 (2017)). Here we provide a general approach that relies on projected CAP formulation and extends gradients and non-adiabatic couplings formulations developed for bound-state electronic structure methods to resonances. The approach is not limited to a specific electron structure method and is generally applicable to any electronic structure methods, provided the information on the gradients and non-adiabatic couplings is available for bound states. Here, we focus on the State-Averaged Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (SA-CASSCF) and Multi-Reference Configurational Interaction with Single excitation (MR-CIS) as our methods of choice. We establish the accuracy of the developed gradients and report equilibrium geometries for several representative temporary anion species ($\mathrm{N_2^-}$, $\mathrm{H_2CO^-}$, $\mathrm{H_2CO_2^-}$ and $\mathrm{C_2H_4^-}$).</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>
