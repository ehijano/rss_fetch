      <title>Phase Diagram of Spin-3/2 Fermions in One Dimensional Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a density matrix renormalization group(DMRG) study of a generalized Hubbard chain describing effective spin S=3/2 fermions in an optical lattice.We determine the full phase diagram for the SU(4) symmetric case, and in the presence of single-ion anisotropy in terms of density and polarization.We investigate the stability and competition between different orders, such as quintet Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) pairing, trion and quartet formation, and spin and atomic density waves.Notably, near half-filling, single-ion anisotropy stabilizes a correlated phase that can be understood in terms of a generalized S=2 bosonic t-J chain.</description>

      <title>Limited thermal and spin transport in a dissipative superfluid junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited transport occurs in various systems when microscopic details give way to fundamental principles, ranging from quantized conductance for fermions in one dimension to quantum-limited sound and spin diffusivity in strongly interacting Fermi gases. However, limited transport in dissipative open quantum systems is rare due to the lack of many conservation laws. In particular, thermal and spin transport in interacting systems under particle dissipation are largely unexplored. Here we observe dissipation-induced but limited thermal and spin transport through a dissipative one-dimensional junction connecting two superfluids of unitary Fermi gases. The thermal and spin conductances of the superfluid junction increase sharply with particle dissipation and seemingly approach values for a non-dissipative, non-interacting system -- limited due to quantum confinement of the junction. This behavior is independent of the dissipation mechanism, being either spin-dependent or pairwise losses. This work may inform theories on interacting open quantum systems and opens up perspectives for dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through the dynamic quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicates a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains how generic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally. It implies that local operators' time-averaged expectation values approximately equal their thermal expectation values, regardless of microscopic details. The ETH's range of applicability therefore impacts theory and experiments. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ recently showed that non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH. Such symmetries have excited interest in quantum thermodynamics lately, as they are equivalent to conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other and noncommutation is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ proposed a non-Abelian ETH, which we support numerically. The numerics model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of up to 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. The matrices bear out seven predictions of the non-Abelian ETH. We also prove analytically that the non-Abelian ETH exhibits a self-consistency property. The proof relies on a thermodynamic-entropy definition different from that in Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ This work initiates the observation and application of the non-Abelian ETH.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hydrodynamics Meets Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of quantum-hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations from the Wigner distribution function. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra. Additionally, we examine the role of the quantum potential, interpreted as a gradient correction to the Thomas--Fermi kinetic energy. Our results provide new insights into quantum effects in plasmonic systems, with significant implications for future advances in nanophotonics through the lens of hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Fermionic atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice potential: topological insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to study the topological properties of matter. In this approach, fermionic atoms are placed in an external magnetic field and in a two-dimensional spin-dependent optical lattice (SDOL) created by intersecting laser beams with a superposition of polarizations. To demonstrate the utility of the SDOL-based technique we compute the topological invariants (Chern numbers) for the SDOL bands as a function of an external magnetic field, and show the existence of a rich topology of the energy bands for this system which does not have parity-time-reversal symmetry. We explicitly consider $^{6}$Li $F=1/2$ atoms. Using a projection matrix method we observe topological phase transitions between an ordinary insulator, an abelian topological insulator, and a non-abelian topological insulator as the external magnetic field strength is varied. Upon introducing edges for the SDOL we find topological edge states (that are correlated with the band Chern numbers) that simultaneously exhibit non-trivial density and spin currents with both a rotational flow contribution and flow along the edge of the SDOL.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of a few-particle fractional quantum Hall fluid in a small lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics in response to time-dependent external potentials of the edge modes of a small fractional quantum Hall fluid composed of few particles on a lattice in a bosonic Laughlin-like state at filling {\nu} = 1/2. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattices that are available in state-of-the-art experiments, away from the continuum limit. Experimentally-accessible data related to the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>
