      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>Nash blowups of 2-generic determinantal varieties in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Nash blowup of 2-generic determinantal varieties over fields of positive characteristic is non-singular. We prove this in two steps. Firstly, we explicitly describe the toric structure of such varieties. Secondly, we show that in this case the combinatorics of Nash blowups are free of characteristic. The result then follows from the analogous result in characteristic zero proved by W. Ebeling and S. M. Gusein-Zade.</description>

      <title>Counting points on character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We count points on the character varieties associated with punctured surfaces and regular semisimple generic conjugacy classes in reductive groups. We find that the number of points are palindromic polynomials. This suggests a $P=W$ conjecture for these varieties. We also count points on the corresponding additive character varieties and find that the number of points are also polynomials, which we conjecture have non-negative coefficients. These polynomials can be considered as the reductive analogues of the Kac polynomials of comet-shaped quivers.</description>

      <title>Minimal extension property of direct images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a projective morphism $f:X\to Y$ from a complex space to a complex manifold, we prove the Griffiths semi-positivity and minimal extension property of the direct image sheaf $f_\ast(\mathscr{F})$. Here, $\mathscr{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$, which consists of the Grauert-Riemenschneider dualizing sheaf, a multiplier ideal sheaf, and a variation of Hodge structure (or more generally, a tame harmonic bundle).</description>

      <title>From Schubert Varieties to Doubly-Spherical Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horospherical Schubert varieties are determined. It is shown that the stabilizer of an arbitrary point in a Schubert variety is a strongly solvable algebraic group. The connectedness of this stabilizer subgroup is discussed. Moreover, a new family of spherical varieties, called doubly spherical varieties, is introduced. It is shown that every nearly toric Schubert variety is doubly spherical.</description>

      <title>Parahoric reduction theory of formal connections (or Higgs fields)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the parahoric reduction theory of formal connections (or Higgs fields) on a formal principal bundle with parahoric structures, which generalizes Babbitt-Varadarajan's result for the case without parahoric structures [5] and Boalch's result for the case of regular singularity [9]. As applications, we prove the equivalence between extrinsic definition and intrinsic definition of regular singularity and provide a criterion of relative regularity for formal connections, and also demonstrate a parahoric version of Frenkel-Zhu's Borel reduction theorem of formal connections [23].</description>

      <title>Extremal Contraction of Projective Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the extremal contractions of several projective bundles over smooth Fano varieties of Picard rank $1$. We provide a whole class of examples of projective bundles with smooth blow-up structures, derived from the notion of drums which was introduced by Occhetta-Romano-Conde-Wi\'sniewski to study interaction with $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions and birational geometry. By manipulating projective bundles, we give a simple geometric construction of the rooftop flip, which was introduced recently by Barban-Franceschini. Additionally, we obtain analogues of some recent results of Vats in higher dimensions. The list of projective bundles we consider includes all globally generated bundles over projective space with first Chern class $2$. For each of them, we compute the nef and pseudoeffective cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projective curves and hypersurfaces defined over a finite field that are tangent to every member of a class of low-degree varieties. Extending 2-dimensional work of Asgarli, we first explore the lowest degrees attainable by smooth hypersurfaces in $n$-dimensional projective space that are tangent to every $k$-dimensional subspace, for some value of $n$ and $k$. We then study projective surfaces that serve as models of finite inversive and hyperbolic planes, finite analogs of spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In these surfaces we construct curves tangent to each of the lowest degree curves defined over the base field.</description>

      <title>Categorifying Quiver Linking/Unlinking using CoHA Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knots-quivers correspondence is a relation between knot invariants and enumerative invariants of quivers, which in particular translates the knot operations of linking and unlinking to a certain mutation operation on quivers. In this paper we show that the moduli spaces of a quiver and its linking/unlinking are naturally related, giving a purely representation theoretic interpretation of these operations. We obtain a relation between the cohomologies of these spaces which is moreover compatible with a natural action of the Cohomological Hall Algebra. The result is a categorification of quiver linking/unlinking at the level of CoHA modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moduli of anti-invariant Higgs bundles as introduced by Zelaci. Using recent existence results of Alper, Halpern-Leistner and Heinloth we establish the existence of a separated good moduli space for semistable anti-invariant Higgs bundles. Along the way this produces a non-GIT proof of the existence of a separated good moduli space for semistable Higgs bundles. We also prove the properness of the Hitchin system in this setting.</description>

Abstract: A harmonic cover of graphs $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ induces a surjective pushforward morphism $p_*:\operatorname{Jac}(\widetilde{X})\to \operatorname{Jac}(X)$ on the critical groups. In the case when $p$ is Galois with abelian Galois group, we compute the order of the kernel of $p_*$, and hence the relationship between the numbers of spanning trees of $\widetilde{X}$ and $X$, in terms of Zaslavsky's bias matroid associated to the cover $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Gubler--K\"unnemann's theory of $\delta$-forms from algebraic varieties to good Berkovich spaces. This is based on the observation that skeletons in such spaces satisfy a tropical balance condition. Our main result is that complete intersection formal models of cycles give rise to Green $\delta$-forms for their generic fibers. We moreover show that, in certain situations, intersection numbers on formal models are given by the $\star$-product of their Green currents. In this way, we generalize some results for divisor intersection to higher codimension situations. We illustrate the mentioned results in the context of an intersection problem for Lubin--Tate spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the positivity property of the tangent bundle $T_X$ of a Fano threefold $X$ with Picard number 2. We determine the bigness of the tangent bundle of the whole 36 deformation types. Our result shows that $T_X$ is big if and only if $(-K_X)^3\ge 34$. As a corollary, we prove that the tangent bundle is not big when $X$ has a standard conic bundle structure with non-empty discriminant. Our main methods are to produce irreducible effective divisors on $\mathbb{P}(T_X)$ constructed from the total dual VMRT associated to a family of rational curves. Additionally, we present some criteria to determine the bigness of $T_X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective horospherical variety of Picard number one. We show that a uniruled projective manifold of Picard number one is biholomorphic to $X$ if its variety of minimal rational tangents at a general point is projectively equivalent to that of $X$. To get a local flatness of the geometric structure arising from the variety of minimal rational tangents, we apply the methods of $W$-normal complete step prolongations. We compute the associated Lie algebra cohomology space of degree two and show the vanishing of holomorphic sections of the vector bundle having this cohomology space as a fiber.</description>

      <title>Deformations of some local Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11738v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deformations of certain crepant resolutions of isolated rational Gorenstein singularities. After a general discussion of the deformation theory, we specialize to dimension three and consider examples which are good (log) resolutions as well as the case of small resolutions. We obtain some partial results on the classification of canonical threefold singularities that admit good crepant resolutions. Finally, we study a non-crepant example, the blowup of a small resolution whose exceptional set is a smooth curve.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A notion of a nearly toric variety is introduced. The examples of nearly toric varieties in the context of Schubert varieties are discussed. In particular, combinatorial characterizations of the smooth and singular nearly toric Schubert varieties are found. Furthermore, the counts and generating series are determined. Additionally, a connection between Dyck paths and a certain family of nearly toric Schubert varieties is established.</description>

      <title>A remarkable class of elliptic surfaces of amplitude 1 in weighted projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surfaces of amplitude 1 in ordinary projective space are of general type, but this need not be the case in weighted projective spaces. Indeed, there are 4 classes of quasi-smooth weighted hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{P}(1,2,a,b)$ of amplitude 1 with an elliptic pencil cut out by hyperplanes. Their moduli spaces are constructed, the monodromy of their universal families is determined as well as their period maps. These all turn out to be non-injective. We analyse the reason behind this, which for each type is different. For the two classes that give properly elliptic surfaces this leads to a mixed Torelli-type theorem as in the case of the Catanese-Kunev-Todorov surfaces. We added an application to certain compactifications of moduli spaces of surfaces of general type with $K^2=1$, $p_g=2$ and $q=0$, as well as detailed SageMath-calculations. The appendix written by Wim Nijgh shows that the general member of the type 1 and type 2 elliptic family has "trivial" Picard lattice, i.e. is spanned by fiber components and a multisection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we aim to extend the concepts of the Fontaine-Faltings module and Higgs-de Rham flow to parabolic versions. The crucial aspect of our generalization lies in the construction of parabolic inverse Cartier functors. The twisted versions discussed in Sun-Yang-Zuo's work can be viewed as a special case, wherein the parabolic weights are equal at every infinity point. We note that a modulo $p$ version of parabolic Higgs-de Rham flow was previously established by Krishnamoorthy and Sheng.</description>

      <title>An axiomatization of six-functor formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider some variations on Mann's definition $\infty$-categorical definition of abstract six-functor formalisms. We consider Nagata six-functor formalisms, that have the additional requirement of having Grothendieck and Wirthm\"uller contexts. We also consider local six-functor formalisms, which in addition to this, take values in presentable stable $\infty$-categories, and have recollements. Using Nagata's compactification theorem, we show that Nagata six-functor formalism on varieties can be given by just specifying adjoint triples for open immersions and for proper morphisms, satisfying certain compatibilities. The existence of recollements is (almost) equivalent to a hypersheaf condition for a Grothendieck topology on the category of ``varieties and spans consisting of an open immersion and a proper map''. Using this characterisation, we show that the category of local six-functor formalisms embeds faithfully into the category of lax symmetric monoidal functors from the category of smooth and complete varieties to the category of presentable stable $\infty$-categories and adjoint triples. We characterise which lax symmetric monoidal functors on complete varieties, taking values in the category of presentable stable $\infty$-categories and adjoint triples, extend to local six-functor formalisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proves, in the case of split groups over arbitrary fields, that all fibers of convolution morphisms attached to parahoric affine flag varieties are paved by products of affine lines and affine lines minus a point. This applies in particular to the affine Grassmannian and to the convolution morphisms in the context of the geometric Satake correspondence. The second part of the article extends these results over $\mathbb Z$. Those in turn relate to the recent work of Cass-van den Hove-Scholbach on the geometric Satake equivalence for integral motives, and provide some alternative proofs for some of their results.</description>

Abstract: Let $\rm{Bun}$ be the moduli stack of rank $2$ bundles with fixed determinant on a smooth proper curve $C$ over a local field $F$. We show how to associate with a Schwartz $\kappa$-density, for $\rm{Re}(\kappa)\ge 1/2$, a smooth function on the corresponding coarse moduli space of very stable bundles. In the non-archimedean case we also prove that the stack $\rm{Bun}$ is $\kappa$-bounded in the sense of Definition 2.10 of [arXiv:2112.08139] for any $\kappa\in\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric products of Galois-Maximal varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the proof that all the symmetric products of a (finite) Galois-Maximal space are also Galois-Maximal spaces. This applies to the special case of real algebraic varieties, solving the problem first stated by Biswas and D'Mello in \cite{biswas&amp;d'mello:symmetric_products_M-curves} about symmetric products of Maximal curves, and then generalised by Baird in \cite{baird:symmetric_products_GM-curves} to Galois-Maximal curves. We also give characterisations of these spaces and state a new definition that generalises to a larger class of spaces. Then, we extend the characterisation in terms of the Borel cohomology given in \cite{us} to the new family. Finally, we introduce the notion of cohomological stability and cohomological splitting, provide a systematic treatment and relate them with the properties of being a Maximal or Galois-Maximal space. These cohomological properties play an important role in the proof of our main theorem.</description>

Abstract: Using Hilbert-Burch matrices, we give an explicit description of the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells on the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb A ^2$ with isolated fixed points. If the fixed point locus is positive dimensional we obtain an \'etale rational map to the cell. We prove Conjecture 4.2 from arXiv:2309.06871 which we realize as a special case of our construction. We also show examples when the construction provides a rational \'etale map to the Hilbert scheme which is not contained in any Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cell. Finally, we give an explicit description of the formal deformations of any ideal in the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane.</description>

      <title>Limiting mixed Hodge structures associated to I-surfaces with simple elliptic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An I-surface $X$ is a surface of general type with $K_X^2 =1$ and $p_g(X) =2$. This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of the period map for I-surfaces acquiring simple elliptic singularities. First we describe the relationship between the deformation theory of such surfaces and their $d$-semistable models. Next we analyze the mixed Hodge structures on the $d$-semistable models, the corresponding limiting mixed Hodge structures, and the monodromy. There are $6$ possible boundary strata for which the relevant limiting mixed Hodge structures satisfy: $\dim W_1 = 4$, and hence $W_2/W_1$ is of pure type $(1,1)$. We show that, in each case, the nilpotent orbit of limiting mixed Hodge structures determines the boundary stratum and prove a global Torelli theorem for one such stratum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise abelian surfaces defined over finite fields containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $3$. Firstly, we complete and expand the characterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus up to $2$ initiated by the first author et al. in previous work. Secondly, we show that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is equivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we can use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny classes containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$. Thirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus $\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree $4$. Finally, we describe absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on abelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and show that their number of rational points is far from the Serre-Weil bound.</description>

Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <title>Torsion Vanishing for Some Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.</description>
