      <title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flares: Population Implications, Rates and Prospects for Gamma-Rays, Gravitational Waves and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar Giant Flares (MGFs) are the most energetic non-catastrophic transients known to originate from stellar objects. The first discovered events were nearby. In recent years, several extragalactic events have been identified, implying an extremely high volumetric rate. We show that future instruments with a sensitivity $\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim 1$ MeV will be dominated by extragalactic MGFs over short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Clear discrimination of MGFs requires intrinsic GRB localization capability to identify host galaxies. As MGFs involve a release of a sizable fraction of the neutron star's magnetic free energy reservoir in a single event, they provide us with invaluable tools for better understanding magnetar birth properties and the evolution of their magnetic fields. A major obstacle is to identify a (currently) small sub-population of MGFs in a larger sample of more energetic and distant sGRBs. We develop the tools to analyze the properties of detected events and their occurrence rate relative to sGRBs. Even with the current (limited) number of events, we can constrain the initial internal magnetic field of a typical magnetar at formation to be $B_0\approx 3\times 10^{14}-2\times 10^{15}$\,G. Larger samples will constrain the distribution of birth fields. We also estimate the contribution of MGFs to the gravitational wave (GW) stochastic background. Depending on the acceleration time of baryon-loaded ejecta involved in MGFs, their GW emission may reach beyond 10~kHz and, if so, will likely dominate over other conventional astrophysical sources in that frequency range.</description>

      <title>Critical Condition of Core-Collapse Supernovae I: One Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the core of a massive star collapses, neutrino heating can energize the stalled accretion shock, leading to a successful supernova. The critical condition that characterizes the transition from accretion to explosion is a central topic of study and is often characterized by a critical proto-neutron star (PNS) neutrino luminosity $L_\nu^{\rm crit}$, which depends on the post-collapse mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ from the progenitor. We examine the critical condition by solving the spherically symmetric time-dependent Euler equations with a general equation of state and realistic microphysics for a range of $\dot{M}$, average neutrino energy $\left&lt; \epsilon_{\nu}\right&gt;$, luminosity $L_{\nu}$, PNS radius $R_{\star}$, mass $M_{\star}$, and pre-shock Mach number $\mathcal{M}$ for a fixed neutrino optical depth from the PNS surface of $2/3$. We derive $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$ as a function of the input parameters. We show that pressurized pre-shock flow, as parameterized by low $\mathcal{M}$, changes the normalization of the critical condition because accretion of higher entropy shells at later times after collapse leads to lower $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$. We connect this finding to the onset of explosion due to compositional interface accretion. Across our parameter space, we test critical conditions that have been proposed in the literature, including the ``antesonic" condition, the ``force explosion condition," and the heuristic heating-advection timescale condition. We discuss how shock oscillations impact these critical conditions. Compared to other explosion conditions, we find that the antesonic ratio shows the least variation across the model space we explore. This work is preparatory for similar experiments in 2D axisymmetry and 3D.</description>

      <title>IXPE Observation of the Low-Synchrotron Peaked Blazar S4 0954+65 During An Optical-X-ray Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray polarization observations made possible with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) offer new ways of probing high-energy emission processes in astrophysical jets from blazars. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of the blazar S4 0954+65 in a high optical and X-ray state. During our multi-wavelength campaign on the source, we detected an optical flare whose peak coincided with the peak of an X-ray flare. This optical-X-ray flare most likely took place in a feature moving along the parsec-scale jet, imaged at 43 GHz by the Very Long Baseline Array. The 43 GHz polarization angle of the moving component underwent a rotation near the time of the flare. In the optical band, prior to the IXPE observation, we measured the polarization angle to be aligned with the jet axis. In contrast, during the optical flare the optical polarization angle was perpendicular to the jet axis; after the flare, it reverted to being parallel to the jet axis. Due to the smooth behavior of the optical polarization angle during the flare, we favor shocks as the main acceleration mechanism. We also infer that the ambient magnetic field lines in the jet were parallel to the jet position angle. The average degree of optical polarization during the IXPE observation was (14.3$\pm$4.1)%. Despite the flare, we only detected an upper limit of 14% (at 3$\sigma$ level) on the X-ray polarization degree; although a reasonable assumption on the X-ray polarization angle results in an upper limit of 8.8% ($3\sigma$). We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and spectral polarization distribution (SPD) of S4 0954+65 with leptonic (synchrotron self-Compton) and hadronic (proton and pair synchrotron) models. The constraints we obtain with our combined multi-wavelength polarization observations and SED modeling tentatively disfavor hadronic models for the X-ray emission in S4 0954+65.</description>

      <title>Maximum possible energies of electrons accelerated in magnetospheres of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. To evaluate the maximum attainable energies of electrons accelerated by means of the magneto-centrifugal mechanism. We examine how the range of maximum possible energies, as well as the primary limiting factors, vary with black hole mass. Additionally, we analyze the dependence of the maximum relativistic factor on an initial distance from the black hole. Methods. To model the acceleration of electrons on rotating magnetic field lines we apply several constraining mechanisms: the inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation and the breakdown of the bead-on-the-wire approximation. Results. The maximal Lorentz factors for electron acceleration vary with the type of a black hole. For stellar-mass black holes, electrons can be accelerated up to the Lorentz factors 2 * 10^(6) - 2 * 10^(8) with only co-rotation constrain affecting the maximal relativistic factor; In intermediate-mass black holes, the Lorentz factors are in the interval 2 * 10^(8) - 2 * 10^(11); For the supermassive black holes the Lorentz factors range from 2.5 * 10^(10) to 2 * 10^(15); while the ultra-massive black hole located at the center of Abell 1201 can accelerate electrons up to 1.1 * 10^(13) - 6.6 * 10^(16). with both the co-rotation and curvature radiation determining the final Lorentz factor for the last three categories</description>

      <title>Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonova spectra provide us with the direct information of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. Ra II, Ac III, and Th III are our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound-bound transitions of these candidates by constructing the line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th III is the most promising species showing strong transitions at the NIR wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th III produces broad absorption features at ~18000 A in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is $\lesssim 6\times10^{-4}$. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, the observations from the space (such as JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features is overlapped with that affected by the strong telluric absorption.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Accretion disc dynamics in extragalactic black hole X-ray binaries: A comprehensive study of M33 X-7, NGC 300 X-1 and IC 10 X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic Black Hole X-ray Binaries (BH-XRBs) are the most intriguing X-ray sources as some of them are `home' to the most massive stellar-mass BHs ever found. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of three massive, eclipsing extragalactic BH-XRBs i.e., M33X-7, NGC300X-1, and IC10X-1 and using entire X-ray observations available from \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} till date. Preliminary analysis using \textit{diskbb} and \textit{powerlaw} models shows that the sources have steep spectra and sub-Eddington luminosities (L&lt;0.69 L$_{Edd}$), with major flux contribution from non-thermal component, resembling the relatively uncharted Steep Powerlaw State (SPL). To understand the accretion disc properties in this state, we explore alternate modelling scenario that reveals the presence of a `hot' ($kT_{in}=1-2$ keV) slim-disc (\textit{diskpbb}) with radial temperature profile $T(r)\propto r^{-p}$ ($p=0.5-0.66$), along with a cooler ($kT_{in}=0.1-0.2$ keV) standard thermal disc (\textit{diskbb}). We carry out the continuum-fitting method using relativistic slim-disc model (\textit{slimbh}) and estimate the mass range of M33 X-7, NGC300X-1 and IC10X-1 is to be 9$-$15 M$_{\odot}$, 9$-$28 M$_{\odot}$ and 10$-$30 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Further, eclipse periods are determined by modelling the lightcurve, using which we estimate the size of the eclipsing bodies. Modelling of the eclipse spectra revealed the complete obscuration of soft spectral component during eclipse, implying the emission of hard component from an extended accretion region. Based on our findings, we provide an inference on geometry of accretion disc in these wind-fed systems and compare their properties with the other two extragalactic BH-XRBs.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear mass models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis and heavy element abundances in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the lack of experimental data on extremely neutron-rich nuclei, theoretical values derived from nuclear physics models are essential for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Metal-poor stars enriched by the $r$-process offer valuable cases for studying the impact of nuclear physics models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis. This study analyzes four widely used nuclear physics models in detail: Finite-Range Droplet Model, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov, Duflo-Zuker, and Weizs$\ddot{\rm a}$cker-Skyrme (WS4). Theoretical values predicted by the WS4 model are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, with deviations significantly smaller than those predicted by other models. The heavy element abundances observed in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars can be accurately reproduced by $r$-process nucleosynthesis simulations using the WS4 model, particularly for the rare earth elements. This suggests that nuclear data provided by nuclear physics model like WS4 are both essential and crucial for $r$-process nucleosynthesis studies.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338 as a dark matter admixed neutron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the inertia moment and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.</description>

      <title>Short-duration gamma-ray bursts from Kerr-Newman black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.</description>

      <title>Constraints on color-flavored locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the processes within compact stars hinges on astrophysical observations. A recent study reported on the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20} \ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.40_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ \rm{km}$, making it the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest that neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of about $1.17M_{\odot}$, raising the question: is this object a typical neutron star, or could it be our first encounter with an "exotic" star? To explore this, we employ the Color-Flavored Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), aiming to constrain it by integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 event with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we model hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, incorporating phase transitions via Maxwell construction. Our analysis indicates that CFL quark matter adequately explains all measurements, including the central compact object of HESS J1731-347.

      <title>The apparent and cosmic rates of short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), GRB~170817A, is often considered a rare event. However, its inferred event rate, $\mathcal{O}(100s)\ \text{Gpc}^{-3}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$, exceeds cosmic sGRB rate estimates from high-redshift samples by an order of magnitude. This discrepancy can be explained by geometric effects related to the structure of the relativistic jet. We first illustrate how adopting a detector flux threshold point estimate rather than an efficiency function, can lead to a large variation in rate estimates. Simulating the Fermi-GBM sGRB detection efficiency, we then show that for a given a universal structured jet profile, one can model a geometric bias with redshift. Assuming different jet profiles, we show a geometrically scaled rate of GRB~170817A is consistent with the cosmic beaming uncorrected rate estimates of short $\gamma$-ray bursts (sGRBs) and that geometry can boost observational rates within $\mathcal{O}(100s)$\,Mpc. We find an apparent GRB~170817A rate of $303_{-300}^{+1580}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ which when corrected for geometry yields $6.15_{-6.06}^{+31.2}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ and $3.34_{-3.29}^{+16.7}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ for two different jet profiles, consistent with pre-2017 estimates of the isotropic sGRB rate. Our study shows how jet structure can impact rate estimations and could allow one to test structured jet profiles. We finally show that modelling the maximum structured jet viewing angle with redshift can transform a cosmic beaming uncorrected rate to a representative estimate of the binary neutron star merger rate. We suggest this framework can be used to demonstrate parity with merger rates or to yield estimates of the successful jet fraction of sGRBs.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the two hard X-ray sources IGR J17503-2636 and IGR J17507-2647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of X-ray observations (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL and Swift) of two hard X-ray sources, IGR J17503-2636 and IGR J17507-2647, whose nature is not fully elucidated in the literature. Three XMM-Newton observations covered the field of IGR J17503-2636, in 2020 and twice in 2023. The analysis of the two XMM-Newton observations performed in September 2023, six days apart, did not detect IGR J17503-2636, allowing us to pose the most stringent 3sigma upper limit on the source flux to date (~9.5x10^-14 erg/cm2/s, 2-10 keV, flux corrected for absorption). This value implies that the amplitude of the X-ray flux variability exceeds a factor of ~2100, compared with the discovery outburst in 2018. A candidate X-ray periodicity at 0.335397(3) seconds has been barely detected (significance of about 3.8sigma) from IGR J17503-2636 with XMM-Newton (pulsed fraction of (10+/-1) per cent). The new data, put into the context of previous literature, allow us to propose a new classification of IGR J17503-2636 as a symbiotic X-ray binary, rather than a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient. IGR J17507-2647 was formerly reported below 10 keV only during Chandra observations performed in 2009. We report here on two XMM-Newton observations that serendipitously covered the source field in 2020 and in 2023, finding a stable X-ray emission, both in X-ray flux and spectral shape. The long-term, persistent X-ray emission has also been probed by several Swift/XRT short observations and by INTEGRAL data spanning several years. We have detected an iron line in the emission (with centroid energy in the range of 6.3-6.6 keV), never reported before in the IGR J17507-2647 spectrum. The source properties favor the identification with a cataclysmic variable.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Instabilities in Over-pressured Magnetized Relativistic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei are observed to be collimated on the parsec scale. When the pressure between the jet and the ambient medium is mismatched, recollimation shocks and rarefaction shocks are formed. Previous numerical simulations have shown that instabilities can destroy the recollimation structure of jets. Aims. In this study, we aim to study the instabilities of non-equilibrium over-pressured relativistic jets with helical magnetic fields. Especially, we investigate how the magnetic pitch affects the development of instabilities. Methods. We perform three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations for different magnetic pitches, as well as a two-dimension simulation and a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation served as comparison groups Results. In our simulations, Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is triggered at the interface between the jet and ambient medium in the recollimation structure of the jet. We found that when the magnetic pitch decreases the growth of RTI becomes weak but interestingly, another instability, the CD kink instability is excited. The excitement of CD kink instability after passing the recollimation shocks can match the explanation of the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in BL Lac qualitatively.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of the $n \Sigma v$ approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In kinetic theory, the classic $n \Sigma v$ approach calculates the rate of particle interactions from local quantities: the number density of particles $n$, the cross-section $\Sigma$, and the average relative speed $v$. In stellar dynamics, this formula is often applied to problems in collisional (i.e. dense) environments such as globular and nuclear star clusters, where blue stragglers, tidal capture binaries, binary ionizations, and micro-tidal disruptions arise from rare close encounters. The local $n \Sigma v$ approach implicitly assumes the ergodic hypothesis, which is not well motivated for the densest star systems in the Universe. In the centers of globular and nuclear star clusters, orbits close into 1D ellipses because of the degeneracy of the potential (either Keplerian or harmonic). We find that the interaction rate in perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potentials is determined by a global quantity -- the number of orbital intersections -- and that this rate can be far lower or higher than the ergodic $n \Sigma v$ estimate. However, we find that in most astrophysical systems, deviations from a perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potential (due to e.g. granularity or extended mass) trigger sufficient orbital precession to recover the $n \Sigma v$ interaction rate. Astrophysically relevant failures of the $n \Sigma v$ approach only seem to occur for tightly bound stars orbiting intermediate-mass black holes, or for the high-mass end of collisional cascades in certain debris disks.</description>

      <title>Radio sources of the survey on the declination of the pulsar in Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of the analysis of 205 brightest sources ( $S&gt;15$ mJy), which were found in the sky survey at the declination of the pulsar in the Crab Nebula, are presented. The survey was conducted at a frequency of 4.7~GHz using a three-beam radiometer complex installed in the focus of the Western Sector of the RATAN-600 radio telescope in 2018-2019. Based on the measurements and data collected in the database of astrophysical catalogs CATS built radio spectra of objects. For a quarter of all detected sources, data at a frequency higher than 4~GHz were obtained for the first time, and for the rest, they were appended. The variability of radiation sources on the scales of the year, from days to months, was studied. The greatest change in the radio flux was found in the blazar B2~1324+22. The search for daily variability was carried out for 26 the brightest sources with an average value of $S_{4.7} \sim 250$ mJy. All sources are identified with objects from optical and infrared catalogs. Radio luminosity is calculated for 112 objects with a known redshift.</description>

      <title>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17632v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS~0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS~0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS~0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Inflation with an Anomalyon and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscous fluids can dissipate and alter the propagation of gravitational waves, as well as modify the relaxation and stability properties of self-gravitating fluids. This is particularly relevant in order to understand the relaxation to equilibrium of neutron stars, and their gravitational wave emission. Here we study the linearized theory of perturbations of spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluids. Dissipative effects are included through the hydrodynamics theory of Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). This theory has been shown to be causal and stable, despite involving only first order gradients. We show how the problem reduces to two coupled wave equations in the axial sector, one of them associated to a novel viscous mode, and including explicitly dissipative terms. In the polar sector, we reduce the problem to five coupled wave equations and one additional constraint. We comment on their causal structure, and recover the causality bounds of the BDNK theory.</description>

      <title>Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical response of viscous materials to gravitational waves, in the context of a fully relativistic theory of fluid dynamics. For the first time, we calculate oscillation modes and scattering properties of viscous stars. Viscous stars absorb high frequency radiation, following a dispersion relation introduced by Press. In the extremely large viscosity regime, stars would become reflectors of waves, but this regime appears to be forbidden by causality bounds. In the context of black hole mimickers, we show how maximally viscous stars on the threshold of stability mimic the absorption of a black hole with the same mass. Our results suggest that rotating viscous stars will amplify incoming radiation.</description>

      <title>RAMBO I: Project introduction and first results with uGMRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hot stars can emit both coherent and incoherent non-thermal radio emission. Understanding the nature of these emissions and their connection to stellar rotation and magnetic field characteristics remains incomplete. The RAdio Magnetospheres of B and O stars (RAMBO) project aims to address this gap by systematically detecting and characterizing gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser radio emission in rapidly rotating magnetic hot stars. Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first detection of radio emission from HD55522 at 650 MHz, confirming it as a new radio-bright magnetic hot star. This supports the predictions of the Centrifugal Breakout model, furthering its application in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in centrifugal magnetospheres of hot stars. Additionally, we report non-detections for four other targets, improving sensitivity limits by a factor of a few compared to previous observations. These findings demonstrate the potential of RAMBO to uncover the complexities of radio emission in massive stars and highlight the need for broader, multi-wavelength observations to probe magnetospheric physics comprehensively. The sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array will enable significant advancements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final stage of black hole evaporation is a potent probe of physics beyond the Standard Model: Hawking-Bekenstein radiation may be affected by quantum gravity "memory burden effects", or by the presence of "dark", beyond-the-Standard-Model degrees of freedom in ways that are testable with high-energy gamma-ray observations. We argue that information on either scenario can best be inferred from measurements of the evaporation's lightcurve and by correlating observations at complementary energies. We offer several new analytical insights in how such observations map on the fundamental properties of the evaporating black holes and of the possible exotic particles they can evaporate into.</description>

      <title>Average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. From Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Unified description of structure and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Skyrme model Sk$\chi$450 constrained by the chiral effective field theory and the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei, we explore the macroscopic static energy spectrum of dense matter. Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Physics in Binary Stars and Applications in Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability criteria of rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental in binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We built the adiabatic mass-loss model and systematically surveyed the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. Many studies indicate that new mass transfer stability thresholds play an essential role in the formation and properties of double compact object populations and the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources. For example, our studies show that the mass transfer in the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch stars and the massive stars can be more stable than previously believed. Consequently, detailed binary population synthesis studies, using updated unstable mass transfer criteria, predicate the non-conservative stable mass transfer may dominate the formation channel of double stellar-mass black holes and can explain the population of the large mass ratio double stellar-mass black holes. Using our updated mass transfer thresholds, binary population thesis studies by Li et al. show that Ge et al.'s results support the observational double white dwarfs merger rate distribution per Galaxy and the space density of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration of electrons at large-amplitude standing whistler waves during laser-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between a thin foil target and a circularly polarized laser light injected along an external magnetic field is investigated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations. A standing wave appears at the front surface of the target, overlapping the injected and partially reflected waves. Hot electrons are efficiently generated at the standing wave due to the relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration if the magnetic field amplitude of the standing wave is larger than the ambient field. A bifurcation occurs in the gyration motion of electrons, allowing all electrons with non-relativistic velocities to acquire relativistic energy through the cyclotron resonance. The optimal conditions for the highest energy and the most significant fraction of hot electrons are derived precisely through a simple analysis of test-particle trajectories in the standing wave. Since the number of hot electrons increases drastically by many orders of magnitude compared to the conventional unmagnetized cases, this acceleration could be a great advantage in laser-driven ion acceleration and its applications.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameter from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (&gt;100 parsecs) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for convergence by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows to accelerate nested sampling. Notably, $\beta$-flows successfully recover the same posteriors and evidences as traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Tleco: A Toolkit for Modeling Radiative Signatures from Relativistic Outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of astrophysical sources exhibit extreme and rapidly varying electromagnetic emission indicative of efficient non-thermal particle acceleration. Understanding these sources often involves comparing data with a broad range of theoretical scenarios. To this end, it is beneficial to have tools that enable not only fast and efficient parametric investigation of the predictions of a specific scenario but also the flexibility to explore different theoretical ideas. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Tleco}, a versatile and lightweight toolkit for developing numerical models of relativistic outflows, including their particle acceleration mechanisms and resultant electromagnetic signature. Built on the Rust programming language and wrapped into a Python library, \texttt{Tleco} offers efficient algorithms for evolving relativistic particle distributions and for solving the resulting emissions in a customizable fashion. \texttt{Tleco} uses a fully implicit discretization algorithm to solve the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation with user-defined diffusion, advection, cooling, injection, and escape, and offers prescriptions for radiative emission and cooling. These include, but are not limited to, synchrotron, inverse-Compton, and self-synchrotron absorption. \texttt{Tleco} is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to model particle acceleration and the resulting electromagnetic spectrum and temporal variability in a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios, including, but not limited to, gamma-ray bursts, pulsar wind nebulae, and jets from active galactic nuclei. In this work, we outline the core algorithms and proceed to evaluate and demonstrate their effectiveness. The code is open-source and available in the GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/zkdavis/Tleco</description>

      <title>X-ray spectra of black hole X-ray binaries with returning radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the disk-corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we assume a lamppost corona and we improve previous calculations of the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. After choosing the radial density profile of the accretion disk, the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of our model in different regimes and we discuss its current limitations as well as the next steps to improve it.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>

Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Low-Frequency Eclipses in Spider MSPs using wideband GMRT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eclipses of radio emission have been reported for ~ 58 spider millisecond pulsars (MSP), of which only around 19% have been extensively studied. Such studies at low frequencies are crucial for probing the properties of the eclipse medium, as eclipses are more prominent at such frequencies. This study investigates eclipses in 10 MSPs in compact orbit using wide-bandwidth observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We report the first evidence of eclipsing for PSR J2234+0944 and J2214+3000 in one epoch, while no evidence of eclipsing was observed in the subsequent two epochs, indicating temporal evolution of the eclipse cutoff frequency in these systems. Constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency were obtained for PSR J1555-2908, J1810+1744, and J2051-0827. Moreover, for the first time, we detected an eclipse at a non-standard orbital phase (~ 0.5) for PSR J1810+1744, with a duration longer than the eclipse observed at superior conjunction. No eclipses were detected for PSR J0751+1807, J1738+0333, and J1807-2459A at 300-500 MHz and 550-750 MHz, for which we discuss the possible reasons. We calculated the mass loss rates of the companions for PSR J1555-2908 and PSR J1810+1744, and found that these rates are insufficient to ablate the companion stars. We cataloged the $\dot{E}/a^2$, mass function, roche lobe filling factor, and inclination angle for compact MSP binaries with low-mass companions and found that higher spin-down flux does not guarantee eclipses. Our analysis, supported by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, reveals that eclipsing black widow binaries generally exhibit a higher mass function compared to non-eclipsing black widow binaries, as reported by previous studies for a limited sample of black widow MSPs.</description>

      <title>Detection of X-ray Emission from a Bright Long-Period Radio Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission on timescales thousands of times longer than radio pulsars. Several models had been proposed implicating either a strong magnetic field neutron star, isolated white dwarf pulsar, or a white dwarf binary system with a low-mass companion. While several models for LPTs also predict X-ray emission, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10-20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832-0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. The X-ray and radio luminosities are correlated and vary by several orders of magnitude. These properties are unique amongst known Galactic objects and require a new explanation. We consider a $\gtrsim0.5$ Myr old magnetar with a $\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G crustal field, or an extremely magnetised white dwarf in a binary system with a dwarf companion, to be plausible explanations for ASKAP J1832-0911, although both explanations pose significant challenges to formation and emission theories. The X-ray detection also establishes a new class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients of luminosity $\sim10^{33}$ erg/s associated with exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties and dark matter admixture with the NITR-I equation of state: Insights from observations and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent observational study has constrained the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs), with particular attention to PSR J0952-0607 and the compact star remnant HESS J1731-347, especially in the low-mass regime. Building on our earlier work, which developed the NITR energy density functional (EDF) to reproduce the mass limit of PSR J0952-0607 but did not satisfy other observational constraints, this study introduces a refined EDF named ``NITR-I". NITR-I successfully reconciles the PSR J0952-0607 mass limit with observational data, including radius measurements from NICER+XMM and tidal deformability constraints from GW170817, demonstrating its robustness. The low-mass constraint associated with HESS J1731-347 indicates diverse NS compositions. Since NITR-I alone cannot satisfy this constraint, we explore the role of dark matter (DM) within NSs to bridge the gap. Incorporating DM, particularly at specific Fermi momentum values, enables the model to address this constraint. We further analyze the influence of DM on various NS properties, such as tidal deformability and non-radial $f$-mode oscillations, across multiple relativistic mean-field models. The presence of DM suggests a reduction in tidal deformability and shifts in oscillation frequencies, potentially offering detectable signatures in gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers. Additionally, we investigate universal relations (URs) for DM-admixed NSs, focusing on correlations such as compactness versus tidal deformability and $f$-mode frequency versus tidal deformability. Canonical values for these properties are estimated using GW170817 data, offering further insights into the structure and composition of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extreme mass-ratio binary systems in which a stellar mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole surrounded by a scalar cloud. Scalar clouds can form through superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around spinning black holes and can also serve as a proxy for dark matter halos. Our framework is fully relativistic and assumes that the impact of the cloud on the geometry can be treated perturbatively. As a proof of concept, here we consider a point particle in circular, equatorial motion around a non-spinning black hole surrounded either by a spherically symmetric or a dipolar non-axisymmetric scalar cloud, but the framework can in principle be generalized to generic black hole spins and scalar cloud geometries. We compute the leading-order power lost by the point particle due to scalar radiation and show that, in some regimes, it can dominate over gravitational-wave emission. We confirm the presence of striking signatures due to the presence of a scalar cloud that had been predicted using Newtonian approximations, such as resonances that can give rise to sinking and floating orbits, as well as "sharp features" in the power lost by the particle at given orbital radii. Finally, for a spherically symmetric scalar cloud, we also compute the leading-order corrections to the black-hole geometry and to the gravitational-wave energy flux, focusing only on axial metric perturbations for the latter. We find that, for non-compact clouds, the corrections to the (axial) gravitational-wave fluxes at high frequencies can be understood in terms of a gravitational-redshift effect, in agreement with previous works.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent horizon finding problem with multigrid methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with direct Urca processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density dependence of the symmetry energy in relativistic mean-field models with density dependent couplings is discussed in terms of the possible opening of nucleonic direct Urca processes inside neutron stars, which induce a very rapid cooling of the star. The modification of the parametrization of the isospin channel of two models, DD2 and DDMEX, keeping the same isoscalar properties is considered and the implications are discussed. Within the models discussed it is not possible the onset of nucleonic direct Urca processes in stars with a mass below $\sim1.6\,M_\odot$ if chiral effective field theory constraints for neutron matter are imposed. A Bayesian inference calculation confirms the low probability that nucleonic direct Urca processes occur inside stars with masses below 1.8$M_\odot$, considering the isoscalar channel of the equation of state described by DD2 or DDMEX and the same symmetry energy at saturation. The lowest masses allowing direct Urca processes are associated with a slope of the symmetry energy above $60$ MeV and most likely a positive symmetry energy incompressibility. It is shown that the parametrization of the isospin channel proposed destroys the correlation between symmetry energy slope and incompressibility previously identified in several works.</description>

      <title>First operation of LArTPC in the stratosphere as an engineering GRAMS balloon flight (eGRAMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a next-generation balloon/satellite experiment utilizing a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber), to simultaneously target astrophysical observations of cosmic MeV gamma-rays and conduct an indirect dark matter search using antimatter. While LArTPCs are widely used in particle physics experiments, they have never been operated at balloon altitudes. An engineering balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (eGRAMS) was conducted on July 27th, 2023, to establish a system for safely operating a LArTPC at balloon altitudes and to obtain cosmic-ray data from the LArTPC. The flight was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan. The total flight duration was 3 hours and 12 minutes, including a level flight of 44 minutes at a maximum altitude of 28.9 km. The flight system was landed on the sea and successfully recovered. The LArTPC was successfully operated throughout the flight, and about 0.5 million events of the cosmic-ray data including muons, protons, and Compton scattering gamma-ray candidates, were collected. This pioneering flight demonstrates the feasibility of operating a LArTPC in high-altitude environments, paving the way for future GRAMS missions and advancing our capabilities in MeV gamma-ray astronomy and dark matter research.</description>
