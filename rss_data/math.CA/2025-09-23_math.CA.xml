      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Absolute Monotonicity of Functions Related to Gaussian Hypergeometric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the absolute monotonicity of two function families associated with the Gaussian hypergeometric function $F(a, b; c; x)$ (where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}_+$): $\mathcal{F}_p(x)=(1-x)^pF(a,b;c;x)$ and $\mathcal{G}_p(x)=(1-x)^p \exp(F(a,b;c;x))$, as well as the logarithmic transform $\ln\mathcal{F}_p(x)$. Our primary goal is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the parameter $p$ such that $-\mathcal{F}'_p$, $\pm\mathcal{G}'_p$ and $\pm(\ln\mathcal{F}_p)'$ are absolutely monotonic on $(0,1)$. Additionally, we derive several results regarding the absolute monotonicity of their higher-order derivatives. As applications, we derive several new inequalities for the Gaussian hypergeometric function $F(a,b;c;x)$. Most importantly, we develop a novel constructive approach based on Jurkat's criterion for power series ratios, which avoids limitations of cumbersome recursive/inductive methods in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Expansion of the Zernike Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even and odd Zernike Polynomials R_n^m(x) can be expanded into sums of even and odd Chebyshev Polynomials T_i(x). This manuscript provides closed forms for the rational expansion coefficients c_{n,m,i} for a set of small 0 &lt;= n-m &lt;= 6 and a holonomic five-term recurrence for these coefficients for all larger n.</description>

      <title>Cardy limit of the 3d superconformal index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superconformal index $Z(q)$ of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories in Cardy-like limits $\beta = \log \tfrac{1}{q} \to 0^+$, extending techniques recently developed in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ context. For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim \beta^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2\pi i})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ \beta}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.
  A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space. This, in turn, hints at a correspondence between 3d monopoles and vortices via 2d duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A\subset \mathbf{N}$ be a finite set of $n=|A|$ positive integers, and consider the cosine sum $f_A(x)=\sum_{a\in A}\cos ax$. We prove that $$\min_x f_A(x)\leqslant -n^{ 1/7-o(1)},$$ thereby establishing polynomial bounds for the Chowla cosine problem.</description>

      <title>A non-linear Roth theorem for thick Cantor sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any function $f$ satisfying certain mild conditions and any Cantor set $K$ with Newhouse thickness greater than $1$, there exists $x\in K$ and $t&gt;0$ such that \[ \{x-t,x,x+f(t)\}\subset K. \] This is an extension of previous work on the existence of three-term arithmetic progressions in Cantor sets to the non-linear setting.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions in interacting lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional systems of point particles located on rectangular lattices and interacting via pairwise potentials. The goal of this paper is to investigate the phase transitions (and their nature) at fixed density for the minimal energy of such systems. The 2D rectangle lattices we consider have an elementary cell of sides $a$ and $b$, the aspect ratio is defined as $\Delta=b/a$ and the inverse particle density $A = a b$; therefore, the ``symmetric'' state with $\Delta=1$ corresponds to the square lattice and the ``non-symmetric'' state to the rectangular lattice with $\Delta\ne 1$. For certain types of the interaction potential, by changing continuously the particle density, such lattice systems undertake at a specific value of the (inverse) particle density $A^*$ a structural transition from the symmetric to the non-symmetric state. The structural transition can be either of first order ($\Delta$ unstick from its symmetric value $\Delta=1$ discontinuously) or of second order ($\Delta$ unstick from $\Delta=1$ continuously); the first and second-order phase transitions are separated by the so-called tricritical point. We develop a general theory on how to determine the exact values of the transition densities and the location of the tricritical point. The general theory is applied to the double Yukawa and Yukawa-Coulomb potentials.</description>

      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection M of measures on X under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\dim_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \dim_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require family $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and collection M to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. Under the same assumptions, we also prove that if the Assouad dimension of X is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz (i.e. with pointwise $\alpha$-H\"older inverse for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$) at $\mu$-a.e. x, for all $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting encompasses families of orthogonal projections, natural projections corresponding to conformal iterated function systems, and non-autonomous or random IFS.
  As applications, we provide novel results on the multifractal analysis, giving formula for the Hausdorff dimension of a level set of the local dimension for a typical (w.r.t the translation parameter) self-similar measure on the line, valid for the full range spectrum (including the decreasing part of the spectrum; previous results were covering only the increasing part).
  Among another applications, we prove that given a parametrized contracting conformal IFS satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter the dimension formula holds for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously. We also prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand's projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a strongly separated self-conformal set and for the collection of all Gibbs measures on a self-conformal set (without any separation).</description>

      <title>Carleson-type embeddings with closed range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Carleson measures $\mu$ on the unit disk for which the image of the Hardy space $H^p$ under the corresponding embedding operator is closed in $L^p(\mu)$. In fact, a more general result involving $(p,q)$-Carleson measures is obtained. A similar problem is solved in the setting of Bergman spaces.</description>
