      <title>Search Smarter, Not Harder: A Scalable, High-Quality Zoned Neutral Atom Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zoned neutral atom architectures are emerging as a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Their growing scale, however, creates a critical need for efficient and automated compilation solutions. Yet, existing methods fail to scale to the thousands of qubits these devices promise. State-of-the-art compilers, in particular, suffer from immense memory requirements that limit them to small-scale problems. This work proposes a scalable compilation strategy that "searches smarter, not harder". We introduce Iterative Diving Search (IDS), a goal-directed search algorithm that avoids the memory issues of previous methods, and relaxed routing, an optimization to mitigate atom rearrangement overhead. Our evaluation confirms that this approach compiles circuits with thousands of qubits and, in addition, even reduces rearrangement overhead by 28.1% on average. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.</description>

      <title>A Threshold-Triggered Deep Q-Network-Based Framework for Self-Healing in Autonomic Software-Defined IIoT-Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.
  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.
  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.
  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Forensic Framework for Inferring Hardware Noise of Cloud Quantum Backend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.</description>

      <title>MoT: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach for Simplifying Cloud-of-Things Application Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is essential for scalable, intelligent systems. However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility. This study represents a step toward a more user-friendly framework, enabling broader adoption of CoT technologies.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</description>

      <title>The PPKN Gate: An Optimal 1-Toffoli Input-Preserving Full Adder for Quantum Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient arithmetic operations are a prerequisite for practical quantum computing. Optimization efforts focus on two primary metrics: Quantum Cost (QC), determined by the number of non-linear gates, and Logical Depth, which defines the execution speed. Existing literature identifies the HNG gate as the standard for Input-Preserving Reversible Full Adders. HNG gate typically requires a QC of 12 and a logical depth of 5, in the area of classical reversible circuits. This paper proposes the PPKN Gate, a novel design that achieves the same inputpreserving functionality using only one Toffoli gate and five CNOT gates. With a Quantum Cost of 10 and a reduced logical depth of 4, the PPKN gate outperforms the standard HNG gate in both complexity and speed. Furthermore, we present a modular architecture for constructing an n-bit Ripple Carry Adder by cascading PPKN modules.</description>
