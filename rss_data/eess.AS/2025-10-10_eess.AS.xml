      <title>SALAD-VAE: Semantic Audio Compression with Language-Audio Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern generative and multimodal models increasingly rely on compact latent representations that trade and balance semantic richness with high-fidelity reconstruction. We introduce SALAD-VAE, a continuous and highly compact semantic Audio Variational Autoencoder, which operates in the frequency domain and achieves state-of-the-art compression with very low latent frame rate (7.8 Hz) while surfacing semantic structure and producing high audio quality. We enhance the standard VAE semantic losses and augmentation, specifically contrastive learning and CLAP-based embedding distillation, enabling it to generalize across diverse audio domains. With a significantly less computational complex architecture than comparable state-of-the-art VAEs, SALAD-VAE matches their reconstruction quality while it consistently outperforms them on a wide range of classification benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed additional loss function provides a trained CLAP projection layer, which can be used zero-shot audio captioning and classification matching pretrained CLAP audio-text embeddings.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex-Bench-v2: A Multi-Turn Evaluation Framework for Duplex Dialogue Systems with an Automated Examiner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While full-duplex speech agents enable natural, low-latency interaction by speaking and listening simultaneously, their consistency and task performance in multi-turn settings remain underexplored. We introduce Full-Duplex-Bench-v2 (FDB-v2), a streaming framework that integrates with an automated examiner that enforces staged goals under two pacing setups (Fast vs. Slow). FDB-v2 covers four task families: daily, correction, entity tracking, and safety. We report turn-taking fluency, multi-turn instruction following, and task-specific competence. The framework is extensible, supporting both commercial APIs and open source models. When we test full-duplex systems with FDB-v2, they often get confused when people talk at the same time, struggle to handle corrections smoothly, and sometimes lose track of who or what is being talked about. Through an open-sourced, standardized streaming protocol and a task set, FDB-v2 makes it easy to extend to new task families, allowing the community to tailor and accelerate evaluation of multi-turn full-duplex systems.</description>

      <title>Guitar Tone Morphing by Diffusion-based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Music Information Retrieval (MIR), modeling and transforming the tone of musical instruments, particularly electric guitars, has gained increasing attention due to the richness of the instrument tone and the flexibility of expression. Tone morphing enables smooth transitions between different guitar sounds, giving musicians greater freedom to explore new textures and personalize their performances. This study explores learning-based approaches for guitar tone morphing, beginning with LoRA fine-tuning to improve the model performance on limited data. Moreover, we introduce a simpler method, named spherical interpolation using Music2Latent. It yields significantly better results than the more complex fine-tuning approach. Experiments show that the proposed architecture generates smoother and more natural tone transitions, making it a practical and efficient tool for music production and real-time audio effects.</description>

      <title>Bloodroot: When Watermarking Turns Poisonous For Stealthy Backdoor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor data poisoning is a crucial technique for ownership protection and defending against malicious attacks. Embedding hidden triggers in training data can manipulate model outputs, enabling provenance verification, and deterring unauthorized use. However, current audio backdoor methods are suboptimal, as poisoned audio often exhibits degraded perceptual quality, which is noticeable to human listeners. This work explores the intrinsic stealthiness and effectiveness of audio watermarking in achieving successful poisoning. We propose a novel Watermark-as-Trigger concept, integrated into the Bloodroot backdoor framework via adversarial LoRA fine-tuning, which enhances perceptual quality while achieving a much higher trigger success rate and clean-sample accuracy. Experiments on speech recognition (SR) and speaker identification (SID) datasets show that watermark-based poisoning remains effective under acoustic filtering and model pruning. The proposed Bloodroot backdoor framework not only secures data-to-model ownership, but also well reveals the risk of adversarial misuse.</description>

      <title>Pseudo2Real: Task Arithmetic for Pseudo-Label Correction in Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data, two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents with the Whisper tiny model.</description>

      <title>DialoSpeech: Dual-Speaker Dialogue Generation with LLM and Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs), have significantly improved expressiveness and naturalness. However, generating human-like, interactive dialogue speech remains challenging. Current systems face limitations due to the scarcity of dual-track data and difficulties in achieving naturalness, contextual coherence, and interactional dynamics, such as turn-taking, overlapping speech, and speaker consistency, in multi-turn conversations. To address these challenges, we propose DialoSpeech, a dual-track architecture combining a large language model with Chunked Flow Matching for expressive, human-like dialogue speech synthesis. DialoSpeech generates natural multi-turn conversations with coherent speaker turns and natural overlaps, supporting both Chinese and English and cross-lingual speech synthesis. We introduce a data processing pipeline to construct dual-track dialogue datasets, facilitating scalable training and experimental validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms baselines, offering a solution for generating human-like spoken dialogues.

      <title>MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters. Audio demos and code are publicly available at https://aslp-lab.github.io/MeanVC.</description>

      <title>LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied with close to 89% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>ACMID: Automatic Curation of Musical Instrument Dataset for 7-Stem Music Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current music source separation (MSS) methods rely on supervised learning, limited by training data quan- tity and quality. Though web-crawling can bring abundant data, platform-level track labeling often causes metadata mismatches, impeding accurate "audio-label" pair acquisi- tion. To address this, we present ACMID: a dataset for MSS generated through web crawling of extensive raw data, fol- lowed by automatic cleaning via an instrument classifier built on a pre-trained audio encoder that filters and aggregates clean segments of target instruments from the crawled tracks, resulting in the refined ACMID-Cleaned dataset. Leverag- ing abundant data, we expand the conventional classifica- tion from 4-stem (Vocal/Bass/Drums/Others) to 7-stem (Pi- ano/Drums/Bass/Acoustic Guitar/Electric Guitar/Strings/Wind- Brass), enabling high granularity MSS systems. Experiments on SOTA MSS model demonstrates two key results: (i) MSS model trained with ACMID-Cleaned achieved a 2.39dB improvement in SDR performance compared to that with ACMID-Uncleaned, demostrating the effectiveness of our data cleaning procedure; (ii) incorporating ACMID-Cleaned to training enhances MSS model's average performance by 1.16dB, confirming the value of our dataset. Our data crawl- ing code, cleaning model code and weights are available at: https://github.com/scottishfold0621/ACMID.</description>

      <title>Personality-Enhanced Multimodal Depression Detection in the Elderly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our solution to the Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) challenge at ACM MM 2025. We propose a multimodal depression detection model in the Elderly that incorporates personality characteristics. We introduce a multi-feature fusion approach based on a co-attention mechanism to effectively integrate LLDs, MFCCs, and Wav2Vec features in the audio modality. For the video modality, we combine representations extracted from OpenFace, ResNet, and DenseNet to construct a comprehensive visual feature set. Recognizing the critical role of personality in depression detection, we design an interaction module that captures the relationships between personality traits and multimodal features. Experimental results from the MPDD Elderly Depression Detection track demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, providing valuable insights for future research in multimodal depression detection among elderly populations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Whisper Embeddings for Audio-based Lyrics Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-based lyrics matching can be an appealing alternative to other content-based retrieval approaches, but existing methods often suffer from limited reproducibility and inconsistent baselines. In this work, we introduce WEALY, a fully reproducible pipeline that leverages Whisper decoder embeddings for lyrics matching tasks. WEALY establishes robust and transparent baselines, while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic features. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies. This work contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>SeamlessEdit: Background Noise Aware Zero-Shot Speech Editing with in-Context Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the fast development of zero-shot text-to-speech technologies, it is possible to generate high-quality speech signals that are indistinguishable from the real ones. Speech editing, including speech insertion and replacement, appeals to researchers due to its potential applications. However, existing studies only considered clean speech scenarios. In real-world applications, the existence of environmental noise could significantly degrade the quality of generation. In this study, we propose a noise-resilient speech editing framework, SeamlessEdit, for noisy speech editing. SeamlessEdit adopts a frequency-band-aware noise suppression module and an in-content refinement strategy. It can well address the scenario where the frequency bands of voice and background noise are not separated. The proposed SeamlessEdit framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multiple quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Towards Frame-level Quality Predictions of Synthetic Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While automatic subjective speech quality assessment has witnessed much progress, an open question is whether an automatic quality assessment at frame resolution is possible. This would be highly desirable, as it adds explainability to the assessment of speech synthesis systems. Here, we take first steps towards this goal by identifying issues of existing quality predictors that prevent sensible frame-level prediction. Further, we define criteria that a frame-level predictor should fulfill. We also suggest a chunk-based processing that avoids the impact of a localized distortion on the score of neighboring frames. Finally, we measure in experiments with localized artificial distortions the localization performance of a set of frame-level quality predictors and show that they can outperform detection performance of human annotations obtained from a crowd-sourced perception experiment.</description>

      <title>Audio-Conditioned Diffusion LLMs for ASR and Deliberation Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have recently attracted growing interest as an alternative to autoregressive decoders. In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.</description>

      <title>STOPA: A Database of Systematic VariaTion Of DeePfake Audio for Open-Set Source Tracing and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.</description>

      <title>I$^2$RF-TFCKD: Intra-Inter Representation Fusion with Time-Frequency Calibration Knowledge Distillation for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intra-inter representation fusion knowledge distillation (KD) framework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$RF-TFCKD) for SE, which achieves distillation through the fusion of multi-layer teacher-student feature flows. Different from previous distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes the time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global knowledge flow. Firstly, we construct a collaborative distillation paradigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set, multi-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated distillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each correlated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that enables inter-set knowledge interaction. Secondly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation based on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the teacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency domains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined allocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to speech characteristics. The proposed distillation strategy is applied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that ranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge. To evaluate the effectiveness of I$^2$RF-TFCKD, we conduct experiments on both single-channel and multi-channel SE datasets. Objective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed KD strategy consistently and effectively improves the performance of the low-complexity student model and outperforms other distillation schemes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist compares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and repeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by continually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or similarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions have typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow settings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind listening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal loss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on the synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose differentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the available literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design with modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss function performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel and established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with differentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the sixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching trials. Performance was measured using parameter differences, spectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We observed a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures. Our post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly dependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding the scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics tailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing one-size-fits-all solutions.</description>

      <title>TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are released at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.</description>

      <title>Open ASR Leaderboard: Towards Reproducible and Transparent Multilingual and Long-Form Speech Recognition Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including dedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.</description>
