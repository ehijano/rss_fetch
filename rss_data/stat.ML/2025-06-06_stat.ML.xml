      <title>On the Wasserstein Geodesic Principal Component Analysis of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry. The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Regret-Optimal Q-Learning with Low Cost for Single-Agent and Federated Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment -- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$ states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs, improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.</description>

      <title>Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire, and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP, we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning Joint Interventional Effects from Single-Variable Interventions in Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational estimator.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Causal Discovery for Grouped Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience, psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements. Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case, demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering among variable groups.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect Identification in lvLiNGAM from Higher-Order Cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants, addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems with latent confounders.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of Completely Randomized Trials: A Large-Deviation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin [2022].</description>

      <title>Savage-Dickey density ratio estimation with normalizing flows for Bayesian model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR) provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators, however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach. The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source harmonic Python package.</description>

      <title>Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a 3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar \emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha &lt; 2$ and the appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$ weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Gradient Descent Improves Neural Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence, and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption (CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary improvement.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery: Workflow and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries. In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy, seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Subjective Perspectives within Learned Representations Predict High-Impact Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however, enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team assembly and research policy.</description>

      <title>On the Mechanism of Reasoning Pattern Selection in Reinforcement Learning for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1) rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models. Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using a Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.</description>

Abstract: The expressiveness of flow-based models combined with stochastic variational inference (SVI) has, in recent years, expanded the application of optimization-based Bayesian inference to include problems with complex data relationships. However, until now, SVI using flow-based models has been limited to problems of fixed dimension. We introduce CoSMIC, normalizing flows (COntextually-Specified Masking for Identity-mapped Components), an extension to neural autoregressive conditional normalizing flow architectures that enables using a single amortized variational density for inference over a transdimensional target distribution. We propose a combined stochastic variational transdimensional inference (VTI) approach to training CoSMIC flows using techniques from Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo gradient estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of VTI on challenging problems that scale to high-cardinality model spaces.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by $\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a $\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound. This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$. We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.</description>

      <title>kTULA: A Langevin sampling algorithm with improved KL bounds under super-linear log-gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}&gt;0$, which significantly improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.</description>

      <title>Unregularized limit of stochastic gradient method for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization offers a compelling framework for model fitting in machine learning, as it systematically accounts for data uncertainty. Focusing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, we investigate the regularized problem where entropic smoothing yields a sampling-based approximation of the original objective. We establish the convergence of the approximate gradient over a compact set, leading to the concentration of the regularized problem critical points onto the original problem critical set as regularization diminishes and the number of approximation samples increases. Finally, we deduce convergence guarantees for a projected stochastic gradient method. Our analysis covers a general machine learning situation with an unbounded sample space and mixed continuous-discrete data.</description>

      <title>Towards Reasonable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning $\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and ${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and mitigate concept leakage.</description>

      <title>NIMO: a Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade, yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction, assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various regression and classification settings.</description>

      <title>UnHiPPO: Uncertainty-aware Initialization for State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics. However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at training and inference time.

      <title>Privacy Amplification Through Synthetic Data: Insights from Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking. In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the future.</description>

      <title>Transformers Meet In-Context Learning: A Universal Approximation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and adapt dynamically to in-context examples.</description>

      <title>Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach, Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations. On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost -- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity and Representation Ability of Test-time Scaling Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction -- remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta &lt; 1$ denotes the probability gap between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of maximum and average distance correlations for multivariate independence testing. We characterize their consistency properties in high-dimensional settings with respect to the number of marginally dependent dimensions, compare the advantages of each test statistic, examine their respective null distributions, and present a fast chi-square-based testing procedure. The resulting tests are non-parametric and applicable to both Euclidean distance and the Gaussian kernel as the underlying metric. To better understand the practical use cases of the proposed tests, we evaluate the empirical performance of the maximum distance correlation, average distance correlation, and the original distance correlation across various multivariate dependence scenarios, as well as conduct a real data experiment to test the presence of various cancer types and peptide levels in human plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently sampling from un-normalized target distributions is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and machine learning. Traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) guarantee asymptotically unbiased samples from such distributions but suffer from computational inefficiency, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional targets, as they require numerous iterations to generate a batch of samples. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and scalable neural implicit sampler that overcomes these limitations. The implicit sampler can generate large batches of samples with low computational costs by leveraging a neural transformation that directly maps easily sampled latent vectors to target samples without the need for iterative procedures. To train the neural implicit samplers, we introduce two novel methods: the KL training method and the Fisher training method. The former method minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the latter minimizes the Fisher divergence between the sampler and the target distributions. By employing the two training methods, we effectively optimize the neural implicit samplers to learn and generate from the desired target distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed samplers, we evaluate them on three sampling benchmarks with different scales.</description>

      <title>One Wave To Explain Them All: A Unifying Perspective On Feature Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature attribution methods aim to improve the transparency of deep neural networks by identifying the input features that influence a model's decision. Pixel-based heatmaps have become the standard for attributing features to high-dimensional inputs, such as images, audio representations, and volumes. While intuitive and convenient, these pixel-based attributions fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Moreover, the choice of domain for computing attributions has often been overlooked. This work demonstrates that the wavelet domain allows for informative and meaningful attributions. It handles any input dimension and offers a unified approach to feature attribution. Our method, the Wavelet Attribution Method (WAM), leverages the spatial and scale-localized properties of wavelet coefficients to provide explanations that capture both the where and what of a model's decision-making process. We show that WAM quantitatively matches or outperforms existing gradient-based methods across multiple modalities, including audio, images, and volumes. Additionally, we discuss how WAM bridges attribution with broader aspects of model robustness and transparency. Project page: https://gabrielkasmi.github.io/wam/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning, it is widely believed that dynamic feature transformation (the rich regime) enhances predictive performance. However, this link does not always hold, and existing richness measures rely on correlated factors - such as performance or parameter norms - which can complicate the analysis of feature learning. We introduce (1) a measure that quantifies the rich regime independently of performance, and (2) interpretable feature metrics for visualization. Leveraging low-rank bias, our approach generalizes neural collapse metrics and captures lazy-to-rich transitions (e.g., grokking) without relying on performance as a proxy. We reveal how batch normalization and training set size influence lazy/rich dynamics for VGG16 and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10/100, opening avenues for better understanding feature learning.</description>

      <title>Functional relevance based on the continuous Shapley value</title>

Abstract: The presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in our society is increasing, which brings with it the need to understand the behavior of AI mechanisms, including machine learning predictive algorithms fed with tabular data, text or images, among others. This work focuses on interpretability of predictive models based on functional data. Designing interpretability methods for functional data models implies working with a set of features whose size is infinite. In the context of scalar on function regression, we propose an interpretability method based on the Shapley value for continuous games, a mathematical formulation that allows for the fair distribution of a global payoff among a continuous set of players. The method is illustrated through a set of experiments with simulated and real data sets. The open source Python package ShapleyFDA is also presented.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Time-to-Event Outcomes: Harnessing Censored Data with Recursively Imputed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring treatments to individual needs is a central goal in fields such as medicine. A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Individual Optimal Policy from Heterogeneous Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of the smooth calibration error and its relationship with functional gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Group Synchronization</title>

Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Higher-Order Spectral Variations in Rectangular Real Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep learning).</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Conditionally Stationary Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery, i.e., inferring underlying causal relationships from observational data, is highly challenging for AI systems. In a time series modeling context, traditional causal discovery methods mainly consider constrained scenarios with fully observed variables and/or data from stationary time-series. We develop a causal discovery approach to handle a wide class of nonstationary time series that are conditionally stationary, where the nonstationary behaviour is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of latent state variables. Named State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI), our approach is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies, with provable identifiablity for the state-dependent causal structures. Empirical experiments on nonlinear particle interaction data and gene regulatory networks demonstrate SDCI's superior performance over baseline causal discovery methods. Improved results over non-causal RNNs on modeling NBA player movements demonstrate the potential of our method and motivate the use of causality-driven methods for forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Policy learning "without" overlap: Pessimism and generalized empirical Bernstein's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies offline policy learning, which aims at utilizing observations collected a priori (from either fixed or adaptively evolving behavior policies) to learn an optimal individualized decision rule that achieves the best overall outcomes for a given population. Existing policy learning methods rely on a uniform overlap assumption, i.e., the propensities of exploring all actions for all individual characteristics must be lower bounded. As one has no control over the data collection process, this assumption can be unrealistic in many situations, especially when the behavior policies are allowed to evolve over time with diminishing propensities for certain actions.
  In this paper, we propose Pessimistic Policy Learning (PPL), a new algorithm that optimizes lower confidence bounds (LCBs) -- instead of point estimates -- of the policy values. The LCBs are constructed using knowledge of the behavior policies for collecting the offline data. Without assuming any uniform overlap condition, we establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of our algorithm, which only depends on (i) the overlap for the optimal policy, and (ii) the complexity of the policy class we optimize over. As an implication, for adaptively collected data, we ensure efficient policy learning as long as the propensities for optimal actions are lower bounded over time, while those for suboptimal ones are allowed to diminish arbitrarily fast. In our theoretical analysis, we develop a new self-normalized type concentration inequality for inverse-propensity-weighting estimators, generalizing the well-known empirical Bernstein's inequality to unbounded and non-i.i.d. data. We complement our theory with an efficient optimization algorithm via Majorization-Minimization and policy tree search, as well as extensive simulation studies and real-world applications that demonstrate the efficacy of PPL.</description>

      <title>A unified weighting framework for evaluating nearest neighbour classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive and large-scale evaluation of classical (NN), fuzzy (FNN) and fuzzy rough (FRNN) nearest neighbour classification. We standardise existing proposals for nearest neighbour weighting with kernel functions, applied to the distance values and/or ranks of the nearest neighbours of a test instance. In particular, we show that the theoretically optimal Samworth weights converge to a kernel. Kernel functions are closely related to fuzzy negation operators, and we propose a new kernel based on Yager negation. We also consider various distance and scaling measures, which we show can be related to each other. Through a systematic series of experiments on 85 real-life classification datasets, we find that NN, FNN and FRNN all perform best with Boscovich distance, and that NN and FRNN perform best with a combination of Samworth rank- and distance-weights and scaling by the mean absolute deviation around the median ($r_1$), the standard deviation ($r_2$) or the semi-interquartile range ($r_{\infty}^*$), while FNN performs best with only Samworth distance-weights and $r_1$- or $r_2$-scaling. However, NN achieves comparable performance with Yager-$\frac{1}{2}$ distance-weights, which are simpler to implement than a combination of Samworth distance- and rank-weights. Finally, FRNN generally outperforms NN, which in turn performs systematically better than FNN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the crossway of machine learning and data analysis, anomaly detection aims at identifying observations that exhibit abnormal behaviour. Be it measurement errors, disease development, severe weather, production quality default(s) (items) or failed equipment, financial frauds or crisis events, their on-time identification and isolation constitute an important task in almost any area of industry and science. While a substantial body of literature is devoted to detection of anomalies, little attention is payed to their explanation. This is the case mostly due to intrinsically non-supervised nature of the task and non-robustness of the exploratory methods like principal component analysis (PCA).
  We introduce a new statistical tool dedicated for exploratory analysis of abnormal observations using data depth as a score. Abnormal component analysis (shortly ACA) is a method that searches a low-dimensional data representation that best visualises and explains anomalies. This low-dimensional representation not only allows to distinguish groups of anomalies better than the methods of the state of the art, but as well provides a -- linear in variables and thus easily interpretable -- explanation for anomalies. In a comparative simulation and real-data study, ACA also proves advantageous for anomaly analysis with respect to methods present in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Impossibility of Fair LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Regularized KL-Divergence for Well-Defined Function-Space Variational Inference in Bayesian neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNN) promise to combine the predictive performance of neural networks with principled uncertainty modeling important for safety-critical systems and decision making. However, posterior uncertainty estimates depend on the choice of prior, and finding informative priors in weight-space has proven difficult. This has motivated variational inference (VI) methods that pose priors directly on the function generated by the BNN rather than on weights. In this paper, we address a fundamental issue with such function-space VI approaches pointed out by Burt et al. (2020), who showed that the objective function (ELBO) is negative infinite for most priors of interest. Our solution builds on generalized VI (Knoblauch et al., 2019) with the regularized KL divergence (Quang, 2019) and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-defined variational objective for function-space inference in BNNs with Gaussian process (GP) priors. Experiments show that our method incorporates the properties specified by the GP prior on synthetic and small real-world data sets, and provides competitive uncertainty estimates for regression, classification and out-of-distribution detection compared to BNN baselines with both function and weight-space priors.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of sample-optimal quantum state tomography with minimal disturbance to the samples. Can we efficiently learn a precise description of a quantum state through sequential measurements of samples while at the same time making sure that the post-measurement state of the samples is only minimally perturbed? Defining regret as the cumulative disturbance of all samples, the challenge is to find a balance between the most informative sequence of measurements on the one hand and measurements incurring minimal regret on the other. Here we answer this question for qubit states by exhibiting a protocol that for pure states achieves maximal precision while incurring a regret that grows only polylogarithmically with the number of samples, a scaling that we show to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Output Gaussian Processes with Stochastic Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Output Gaussian Process is is a popular tool for modelling data from multiple sources. A typical choice to build a covariance function for a MOGP is the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) which parametrically models the covariance between outputs. The Latent Variable MOGP (LV-MOGP) generalises this idea by modelling the covariance between outputs using a kernel applied to latent variables, one per output, leading to a flexible MOGP model that allows efficient generalization to new outputs with few data points. Computational complexity in LV-MOGP grows linearly with the number of outputs, which makes it unsuitable for problems with a large number of outputs. In this paper, we propose a stochastic variational inference approach for the LV-MOGP that allows mini-batches for both inputs and outputs, making computational complexity per training iteration independent of the number of outputs.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow in parameter space is equivalent to linear interpolation in output space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the standard gradient flow in parameter space that underlies many training algorithms in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. Moreover, for the $L^{2}$ loss, if the Jacobian of the outputs with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved. For the cross-entropy loss, under the same rank condition and assuming the labels have positive components, we derive an explicit formula for the unique global minimum.</description>

      <title>Measuring Uncertainty Disentanglement Error in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current methods for disentangling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in classification with Bayesian Neural Networks have been receiving strong criticism. Information Theoretic measures for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are not independent, due to the additivity assumption. However, these investigations do not consider Gaussian Logits, an alternative approach that gets less attention. In this paper, we present a set of three experiments that manipulate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in isolation to benchmark the quality of disentanglement using multiple datasets. Based on these experiments we define the Disentanglement Error as a metric for the quality of disentanglement.
  We evaluate Information Theoretic and Gaussian Logits disentangling over multiple Bayesian Neural Networks approximations and show that Deep Ensembles with Information Theoretic disentanglement have the best Disentanglement Error, but there is still room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Mining Causality: AI-Assisted Search for Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The instrumental variables (IVs) method is a leading empirical strategy for causal inference. Finding IVs is a heuristic and creative process, and justifying its validity -- especially exclusion restrictions -- is largely rhetorical. We propose using large language models (LLMs) to search for new IVs through narratives and counterfactual reasoning, similar to how a human researcher would. The stark difference, however, is that LLMs can dramatically accelerate this process and explore an extremely large search space. We demonstrate how to construct prompts to search for potentially valid IVs. We contend that multi-step and role-playing prompting strategies are effective for simulating the endogenous decision-making processes of economic agents and for navigating language models through the realm of real-world scenarios, rather than anchoring them within the narrow realm of academic discourses on IVs. We apply our method to three well-known examples in economics: returns to schooling, supply and demand, and peer effects. We then extend our strategy to finding (i) control variables in regression and difference-in-differences and (ii) running variables in regression discontinuity designs.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control is Almost Optimal for Restless Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a \emph{model predictive control} based non-stationary policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as \emph{dissipativity}. Our solution easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus, be of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.</description>

      <title>Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

      <title>Latent Safety-Constrained Policy Approach for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the objective is to develop a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints, utilizing only offline data. Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing existing methods. Additional visualizations provide further insights into the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of our approach.</description>

      <title>An analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can generate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However, optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models. The code is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/cusp.</description>

      <title>Learning Hyperparameters via a Data-Emphasized Variational Objective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training large flexible models on limited data, avoiding overfitting is a practical concern. Common grid search or smarter search methods rely on expensive separate runs at each candidate hyperparameter while carving out a validation set that reduces available training data. In this paper, we consider direct gradient-based learning of regularization hyperparameters on the full training set via the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from Bayesian variational methods. We focus on scenarios where the model is over-parameterized for flexibility while the approximate posterior is chosen to be Gaussian with isotropic covariance for tractability, even though it cannot match the true posterior exactly. In such scenarios, we find the ELBo prioritizes posteriors that match the prior variance, which leads to severely underfitting the data. Instead, we recommend a data-emphasized ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior. In Bayesian transfer learning of classifiers for text and images, our method reduces 88+ hour grid searches of past work to under 3 hours while delivering comparable accuracy. We further demonstrate how our approach enables efficient yet accurate approximations of Gaussian processes with learnable length-scale kernels.</description>

      <title>Are all models wrong? Fundamental limits in distribution-free empirical model falsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistics and machine learning, when we train a fitted model on available data, we typically want to ensure that we are searching within a model class that contains at least one accurate model -- that is, we would like to ensure an upper bound on the model class risk (the lowest possible risk that can be attained by any model in the class). However, it is also of interest to establish lower bounds on the model class risk, for instance so that we can determine whether our fitted model is at least approximately optimal within the class, or, so that we can decide whether the model class is unsuitable for the particular task at hand. Particularly in the setting of interpolation learning where machine learning models are trained to reach zero error on the training data, we might ask if, at the very least, a positive lower bound on the model class risk is possible -- or are we unable to detect that "all models are wrong"? In this work, we answer these questions in a distribution-free setting by establishing a model-agnostic, fundamental hardness result for the problem of constructing a lower bound on the best test error achievable over a model class, and examine its implications on specific model classes such as tree-based methods and linear regression.</description>

      <title>Bandit Multiclass List Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass list classification with (semi-)bandit feedback, where input examples are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible labels. In each round of the interaction, the learner observes feedback consisting of the predicted labels which lie in some underlying set of ground truth labels associated with the given example. Our main result is for the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal hypothesis with high probability using a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O} \big( (\mathrm{poly}(K/m) + sm / \varepsilon^2) \log (|H|/\delta) \big)$ where $H$ is the underlying (finite) hypothesis class and $s$ is an upper bound on the number of true labels for a given example. This bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s \ll K$. Moreover, in the regime where $s = O(1)$ the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no cost. Our PAC learning algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $H$. In the special case of single-label classification corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove a sample complexity bound of $O \big((K^7 + 1/\varepsilon^2)\log (|H|/\delta)\big)$ which improves upon recent results in this scenario (Erez et al. '24). Additionally, we consider the regret minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a regret bound of $\widetilde O(|H| + \sqrt{smT \log |H|})$. Our results generalize and extend prior work in the simpler single-label setting (Erez et al. '24), and apply more generally to contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problems with $s$-sparse rewards.</description>

Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Augmented Invertible Koopman Autoencoder for long-term time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930</link>

Abstract: Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Poisson Surface Reconstruction with One Solve using Geometric Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poisson Surface Reconstruction is a widely-used algorithm for reconstructing a surface from an oriented point cloud. To facilitate applications where only partial surface information is available, or scanning is performed sequentially, a recent line of work proposes to incorporate uncertainty into the reconstructed surface via Gaussian process models. The resulting algorithms first perform Gaussian process interpolation, then solve a set of volumetric partial differential equations globally in space, resulting in a computationally expensive two-stage procedure. In this work, we apply recently-developed techniques from geometric Gaussian processes to combine interpolation and surface reconstruction into a single stage, requiring only one linear solve per sample. The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be queried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric meshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic collision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray casting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform next-view planning on a per-ray basis. They also do not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with diagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations, unlike prior methods. Results show that our approach provides a cleaner, more-principled, and more-flexible stochastic surface reconstruction pipeline.</description>

      <title>PEAKS: Selecting Key Training Examples Incrementally via Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning continues to be driven by ever-larger datasets, understanding which examples are most important for generalization has become a critical question. While progress in data selection continues, emerging applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts. To bridge this gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the full data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the underlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature space and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection method tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as training data size grows on real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/BurakGurbuz97/PEAKS.</description>

      <title>Weak Physics Informed Neural Networks for Geometry Compatible Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), owing to their mesh-free nature, offer a powerful approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex geometries, including irregular domains. This capability effectively circumvents the challenges of mesh generation that traditional numerical methods face in high-dimensional or geometrically intricate settings. While recent studies have extended PINNs to manifolds, the theoretical foundations remain scarce. Existing theoretical analyses of PINNs in Euclidean space often rely on smoothness assumptions for the solutions. However, recent empirical evidence indicates that PINNs may struggle to approximate solutions with low regularity, such as those arising from nonlinear hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we develop a framework for PINNs tailored to the efficient approximation of weak solutions, particularly nonlinear hyperbolic equations defined on manifolds. We introduce a novel weak PINN (wPINN) formulation on manifolds that leverages the well-posedness theory to approximate entropy solutions of geometry-compatible hyperbolic conservation laws on manifolds. Employing tools from approximation theory, we establish a convergence analysis of the algorithm, including an analysis of approximation errors for time-dependent entropy solutions. This analysis provides insight into the accumulation of approximation errors over long time horizons. Notably, the network complexity depends only on the intrinsic dimension, independent of the ambient space dimension. Our results match the minimax rate in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, demonstrating that PINNs can alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the context of low-dimensional manifolds. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed wPINN framework through numerical experiments, confirming its ability to efficiently approximate entropy solutions on manifolds.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that preserve transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective variables (CVs) play a crucial role in capturing rare events in high-dimensional systems, motivating the continual search for principled approaches to their design. In this work, we revisit the framework of quantitative coarse graining and identify the orthogonality condition from Legoll and Lelievre (2010) as a key criterion for constructing CVs that accurately preserve the statistical properties of the original process. We establish that satisfaction of the orthogonality condition enables error estimates for both relative entropy and pathwise distance to scale proportionally with the degree of scale separation. Building on this foundation, we introduce a general numerical method for designing neural network-based CVs that integrates tools from manifold learning with group-invariant featurization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct CVs for butane and achieve a CV that reproduces the anti-gauche transition rate with less than ten percent relative error. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence challenging the necessity of uniform positive definiteness in diffusion tensors for transition rate reproduction and highlight the critical role of light atoms in CV design for molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion-Based Priors: An Approximation-Free Ensemble Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However, current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based methods.</description>
