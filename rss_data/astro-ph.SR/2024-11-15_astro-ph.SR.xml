      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412: Three microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov &amp; Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.</description>

      <title>Unstable gas flow in a flat channel under the influence of a transverse force field: self-oscillations of the jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subsonic flow of an ideal gas through a flat channel in the presence of a mass force field is considered. The forces acting on the gas are reduced to the attraction to the channel axis in a certain region of the channel. It has been shown that the occurrence of a zone of increased pressure along the axis of a channel leads to the formation of a pressure gradient, which acts as an effective force which opposes the flow. As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric. The characteristics of this instability have been studied numerically in the present work. Possible astrophysical implications of this phenomenon are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The rotation properties of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the LAMOST spectroscopy and TESS time-series photometry, we have obtained a main-sequence star sample of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars. The sample includes 1534 $\delta$ Sct stars, 367 $\gamma$ Dor stars, 1703 $\delta$ Sct$| \gamma$ Dor stars, 270 $\gamma$ Dor$| \delta$ Sct stars, along with 105 '$\delta$ Sct candidates' and 32 '$\gamma$ Dor candidates'. After correcting for projection effects, we derived the equatorial rotational velocity distribution for $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars and compared it with that of normal stars. The rotational velocity distributions of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 $M_{\odot}$, the rotational velocity distribution of $\delta$ Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while $\delta$ Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the $\delta$ Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution. The photometric amplitude in $\delta$ Sct stars is modulated with rotational velocity, with high-amplitude stars typically rotating slowly and low-amplitude stars showing a broad distribution of rotational velocities.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>

      <title>New Results on the Onset of a Coronal Mass Ejection from 5303 {\AA} Emission Line Observations with VELC/ADITYA-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the onset of a coronal mass ejection (CME) using spectroscopic observations in 5303 {\AA} coronal emission line with the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1, the recently launched first Indian space solar mission. The CME was observed on 16 July 2024 in association with a X1.9 class soft X-ray flare from heliographic location S05W85. The VELC observations were near the west limb of Sun during the CME. The results obtained helped to constrain the onset time of the CME. In addition, they indicate ${\approx}$50% decrease in the coronal intensity near the source region of the CME due to mass depletion, ${\approx}$15% enhancement in the emission line width, and redshifted Doppler velocity of about ${\approx}10$ km/s. The non-thermal velocity associated with the line broadening is ${\approx}24.87$ km/s.</description>

      <title>New orbital periods of high-inclination dwarf novae based on Gaia Alerts photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital period of a cataclysmic variable stands as a crucial parameter for investigating the structure and physics of these binary systems, as well as understanding their evolution. We use photometric Gaia data for dwarf novae (DNe) in the quiescent state which are available for a number of years to determine new orbital periods and improve/modify previously suggested values. Two approaches are implemented for selecting high-inclination targets, either eclipsing or with ellipsoidal variations. We determine new orbital periods for 75 DNe and improve ephemerides for 27 more (three of which change significantly), contributing 9.4% of the known DNe periods of 0.05-2.0 days, and doubling the number of known periods exceeding 0.44 days. Their phase-folded light curves are presented and arranged by orbital period, illustrating the transition from short-period systems, dominated by radiation from the accretion disc and the hot spot, to longer-period DNe, where the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star is the primary visual flux source. This transition -which occurs around the well-known period gap (around 2-3 hours)- is expected, as DNe with larger orbital periods typically harbour more massive donors, which contribute to the visible flux. However, this transition is not abrupt. Within the same range of periods, we observe systems dominated by ellipsoidal variations, where the companion star is clearly visible, as well as others dominated by the disc and hot spot. The presence of some DNe with ellipsoidal variations near the lower edge of the period gap is striking, as the companions in these systems are expected to be cool low-mass M-dwarfs not visible in the light curve. This could indicate that we are observing systems where the donor star was originally much more massive and underwent significant nuclear evolution before mass-transfer began, as has been suggested previously for QZ Ser.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific $f(R,T)$ functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the $f(R,T)$ functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass T Tauri disk masses and a comparison to their Herbig disk descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precursors of Herbig stars are called Intermediate Mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, which have spectral types later than F, but stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_\odot, and will eventually become Herbig stars with spectral types of A and B. ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with continuum observations, 32 of which have at least 12CO, 13CO, or C18O observations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk integrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are used to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission. Using thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we additionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO isotopologues. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius distributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher compared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks. No differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in contrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined show similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust and gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that there also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to form the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to form the atmospheres of exoplanets. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk population is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk masses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we conclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and thus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks.</description>

      <title>A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in C17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_\oplus for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while ~50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M_\oplus, this is at most 25% for the T~Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T~Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.</description>

      <title>NGTS-33b: A Young Super-Jupiter Hosted by a Fast Rotating Massive Hot Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar type stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to challenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more importantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we report NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and orbital period of 3.6 $\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\rm jup}$, 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 R$_{\rm jup}$ and $2.827972 \pm 0.000001$ days, respectively. The host is a fast rotating ($0.6654 \pm 0.0006$ day) and hot (T$_{\rm eff}$ = 7437 $\pm$ 72 K) A9V type star, with a mass and radius of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\odot}$ and 1.47 $\pm$ 0.06 R$_{\odot}$, respectively. Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows that NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition, membership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2 association, which has an age of $\sim$ 20-35 Myr, thus providing further evidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of 0.19$\pm$0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ is 13$\%$ smaller than expected when compared to transiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by its age, where an up to 15$\%$ inflated atmosphere is expected from planet structure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is similar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for atmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b's discovery will not only add to the scarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place further strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a variety of sources and are dynamically transported across the solar system. While in transport, high-$Z$ solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of $\sim$1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain's space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities ($&gt;10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 $\mu$m are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.7}$. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of $r^{-1.0}$ does allow for the accumulation of $&gt;$$10^{10}$ tracks cm$^{-2}$ in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-$Z$ SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.</description>

      <title>The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

      <title>Compression Method for Solar Polarization Spectra Collected from Hinode SOT/SP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex structure and extensive details of solar spectral data, combined with a recent surge in volume, present significant processing challenges. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based compression technique using deep autoencoder (DAE) and 1D-convolutional autoencoder (CAE) models developed with Hinode SOT/SP data. We focused on compressing Stokes I and V polarization spectra from the quiet Sun, as well as from active regions, providing a novel insight into comprehensive spectral analysis by incorporating spectra from extreme magnetic fields. The results indicate that the CAE model outperforms the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes profiles, demonstrating greater robustness and achieving reconstruction errors around the observational noise level. The proposed method has proven effective in compressing Stokes I and V spectra from both the quiet Sun and active regions, highlighting its potential for impactful applications in solar spectral analysis, such as detection of unusual spectral signals.</description>

      <title>Gl 725A b: a potential super-Earth detected with SOPHIE and SPIRou in an M dwarf binary system at 3.5 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a super-Earth candidate orbiting the nearby mid M dwarf Gl\,725A using the radial velocity (RV) method. The planetary signal has been independently identified using high-precision RVs from the SOPHIE and SPIRou spectrographs, in the optical and near-infrared domains, respectively. We modelled the stellar activity signal jointly with the planet using two Gaussian Processes, one for each instrument to account for the chromaticity of the stellar activity and instrumental systematics, along with a Keplerian model. The signal is significantly detected with a RV semi-amplitude of $1.67\pm0.20$ m/s. The planet Gl 725A b is found to be in an orbit compatible with circular with a period of $11.2201\pm0.0051$ days. We analysed 27 sectors of TESS photometry on which no transit event was found. We determined a minimum mass of $M_{p}\sin{i}=2.78\pm0.35\,M_{\oplus}$ which places the planet in the super-Earth regime. Using Mass-Radius relationships we predict a planetary radius to be between 1.2 and $2.0\,R_{\oplus}$. The proximity of Gl 725A, of only 3.5 pc, makes this new exoplanet one of the closest to Earth and joins the group of S-type low-mass planets in short orbits ($P&lt;15$ d) around close M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A new investigation on the characteristics of a W UMa type system LO Andromedae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type system LO Andromedae (LO And) was observed over nine nights at Durham to fully investigate its physical properties and update its stellar parameters. After obtaining the observational data in both V-filter and B-filter, the Gaia CCD images of LO And were extracted from the Astrolab internal archive using Linux commands. By applying the "Nightfall" program and local Python scripts, the calibrated light curves of LO And can be plotted, phase-folded, and fitted to derive the period of this system as $0.3804573 \pm 0.0000482\, \mathrm{d}$. Then, 2D chi-squared heat maps were illustrated to determine LO And's best-fit stellar parameters and estimate their uncertainties, including the mass ratio $q = 0.371 \pm 0.207$, the inclination $i = 78.5 \pm 3.8\, \mathrm{deg}$, the primary temperature $T_1 = 6290 \pm 358\, \mathrm{K}$, the secondary temperature $T_2 = 6449 \pm 445\, \mathrm{K}$, and two fill factors $f_1 = f_2 = 1.02258$. In addition, the "Nightfall" program built the 3D models and evaluated the spot distribution parameters to visualize the configuration of LO And. There were seven new eclipsing timings added in this study to reconstruct the O-C diagram together with LO And's previous observational data. It was clearly found that the period of LO And is currently undergoing an accelerated increase with a change rate $d\mathrm{P}/d\mathrm{t} = 2.27 \times 10^{-7}\, \mathrm{day\, yr^{-1}}$, which was attributed to the mass transfer in this system with a transfer rate $dM_1/d\mathrm{t} = 1.43 \times 10^{-7}\, \mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$ and the light time effect caused by the possible existence of a third star $M_3 = 0.224\, M_\odot$ orbiting around LO And.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important in distinguishing whether compact stars could contain electric charge. We also employ another electric charge distribution profile that follows a power law, and it is found that the $f$-mode change is more noticeable than the $p_1$-mode when the electric charge is incremented.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Level Density and $\gamma$-ray Strength Function of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$ and the impact on the i-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton-$\gamma$ coincidences from $(\mathrm{d},\mathrm{p})$ reactions between a $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}$ beam and a deuterated polyethylene target have been analyzed with the inverse-Oslo method to find the nuclear level density (NLD) and $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$. The $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(n,\gamma)$ capture cross section has been calculated using the Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS using the measured NLD and $\gamma$SF as constraints. The results confirm that the $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(n,\gamma)$ reaction acts as a bottleneck when relying on one-zone nucleosynthesis calculations. However, the impact of this reaction is strongly dampened in multi-zone models of low-metallicity AGB stars experiencing i-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Expansion Kinematics of Young Clusters. I. Lambda Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster Lambda Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in Lambda Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5$\sigma$ significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of $0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1}$ to give an expansion timescale of $6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr$, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.</description>
