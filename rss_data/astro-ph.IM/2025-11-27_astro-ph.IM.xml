      <title>StarEstate: A Python Package for Galactic Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.</description>

      <title>A Direct Calibration Algorithm for ADC Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel direct calibration algorithm to address phase delay, gain, and offset mismatches in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) time interleaving systems. These mismatches, common in high-speed data acquisition, degrade system performance and signal integrity, particularly in applications such as radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Our proposed algorithm uses a sinusoidal reference signal and Fourier analysis to isolate and correct each type of mismatch, providing a computationally efficient solution. Extensive numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its ability to significantly enhance signal reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods. This work provides a robust and scalable solution for maintaining signal fidelity in interleaved ADC systems and has broad applications in fields that require high-speed data acquisition.</description>

      <title>TriPoDPy: 1D Tri-Population size distributions forDust evolution in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TriPoDPy is a code simulating the dust evolution, including dust growth and dynamics in protoplanetary disks using the parametric dust model presented in (Pfeil et al., 2024). The simulation evolves a dust distribution in a one-dimensional grid in the radial direction. It's written in Python and the core routines are implemented in Fortran90. The code not only solves for the evolution of the dust but also the gas disk with the canonical alpha-description (Shakura &amp; Sunyaev, 1973). In addition to the original model, we added descriptions of tracers for the dust and gas, which could be used for compositional tracking of additional components.</description>

      <title>The WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey: Expanding WEAVE's Reach to Bright and Low-Surface-Density Targets with a Novel Observing Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Galaxy Classification with U-Net Variational Autoencoders. II. JWST High Redshift Galaxy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous work, we apply a U-Net Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to denoise galaxy images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and enhance morphological classification. This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe. The results highlight the potential of VAE-based denoising as a robust pre-processing step for analyzing high-redshift galaxy populations in ongoing astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Denoising gravitational wave with deep learning in the time-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Neural Deprojection of Galaxy Stellar Mass Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a neural approach to dynamical modeling of galaxies that replaces traditional imaging-based deprojections with a differentiable mapping. Specifically, we train a neural network to translate Nuker profile parameters into analytically deprojectable Multi Gaussian Expansion components, enabling physically realistic stellar mass models without requiring optical observations. We integrate this model into SuperMAGE, a differentiable dynamical modelling pipeline for Bayesian inference of supermassive black hole masses. Applied to ALMA data, our approach finds results consistent with state-of-the-art models while extending applicability to dust-obscured and active galaxies where optical data analysis is challenging.</description>

      <title>ECOGAL I. Project design and the first catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ECOology for Galaxies using ALMA archive and Legacy surveys (ECOGAL), an ALMA data mining project. Using the footprints of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we query and uniformly reprocess ALMA data to produce continuum images and two complementary source catalogues: (i) a prior-based catalogue anchored to optical/near-infrared detections, and (ii) a blind catalogue based on significant ALMA detections. Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 &lt; z &lt; 15.0$. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from $0.12 &lt; z &lt; 6.85$. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage.</description>

      <title>Spectuner-D1: Spectral Line Fitting of Interstellar Molecules Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral lines from interstellar molecules provide crucial insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the interstellar medium. Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS. We perform the fitting for CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_3$CN. For a 100 $\times$ 100 region covering 5 GHz bandwidth, the fitting process requires 4.9 to 41.9 minutes using a desktop with 16 cores and one consumer-grade GPU card.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Robust Multiband Modeling of AGN Light Curves in Rubin-LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 years with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented dataset will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX, a scalable light curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST's multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\sim 10^2-10^4 \times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX's multiband capability allows robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs -- such as those residing in dwarf galaxies -- through their distinctive variability signatures.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for the Processing and Storage of Radio Astronomy Data for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era using uv-Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of radio astronomy telescopes are challenging existing data analysis paradigms, as they have an order of magnitude more antennas and larger bandwidth. Foremost amongst these are deep spectral line surveys, because these have the largest number of epochs and spectral channels per dataset. For example, the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) project on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) aims to observe over 3,000 hours spread over hundreds of observing sessions, covering two pointings and two frequency settings. The two primary problems encountered when processing this data are the need for storage and that processing is primarily I/O limited. To address these issues, we have implemented an deep imaging pipeline based on the storage of an intermediate data product in the software ASKAPSoft, that of the uv-gridded data, and have demonstrated lossy and lossless compression of this data on ASKAP, using MGARD and ADIOS2 libraries. We find data compression ratios from a factor of 7 (lossless) up to 20 (using lossy compression with an absolute error bound of $10^{-4}$), and processing is faster by a factor of 7 for lossless compression. We discuss the effectiveness of lossy MGARD compression and its adherence to the designated error bounds, the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the potential consequences of these I/O and storage improvements on the science quality of the data products.</description>

      <title>AKRA 2.0: Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying matter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in cosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence ($\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks, which seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making method. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary conditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\kappa$ maps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by integrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence field over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a scale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts: large-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale analysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both analyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\kappa$ map. We tested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks, demonstrating that the reconstructed $\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high accuracy. For the reconstructed $\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the reconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\kappa^{\rm{rec}}$ and the correlation coefficient with the true $\kappa$ map $r_\ell$ achieve accuracies of $(1-C_\ell^{\rm{rec}}/C_\ell^{\rm{true}}) \lesssim 1\%$ and $(1-r_\ell) \lesssim 1\%$, respectively. Our algorithm is capable of straightforwardly handling further issues such as inhomogeneous shape measurement noise, which we will address in subsequent analysis.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We began the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Mapping with Ariel: Future Prospects for a Population-Level Mapping Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our demographic understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.</description>
