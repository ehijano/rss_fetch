      <title>Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Speech LLMs via Text-Only Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Modality Gap: Softly Discretizing Audio Representation for LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One challenge of integrating speech input with large language models (LLMs) stems from the discrepancy between the continuous nature of audio data and the discrete token-based paradigm of LLMs. To mitigate this gap, we propose a method for integrating vector quantization (VQ) into LLM-based automatic speech recognition (ASR). Using the LLM embedding table as the VQ codebook, the VQ module aligns the continuous representations from the audio encoder with the discrete LLM inputs, enabling the LLM to operate on a discretized audio representation that better reflects the linguistic structure. We further create a soft "discretization" of the audio representation by updating the codebook and performing a weighted sum over the codebook embeddings. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves upon the LLM-based ASR baseline, particularly in out-of-domain conditions. This work highlights the potential of soft discretization as a modality bridge in LLM-based ASR.</description>

      <title>Diarization-Aware Multi-Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (MS-ASR) faces significant challenges in transcribing overlapped speech, a task critical for applications like meeting transcription and conversational analysis. While serialized output training (SOT)-style methods serve as common solutions, they often discard absolute timing information, limiting their utility in time-sensitive scenarios. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for conversational audio processing, we propose a novel diarization-aware multi-speaker ASR system that integrates speaker diarization with LLM-based transcription. Our framework processes structured diarization inputs alongside frame-level speaker and semantic embeddings, enabling the LLM to generate segment-level transcriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the system achieves robust performance in multilingual dyadic conversations and excels in complex, high-overlap multi-speaker meeting scenarios. This work highlights the potential of LLMs as unified back-ends for joint speaker-aware segmentation and transcription.</description>

      <title>TADA: Training-free Attribution and Out-of-Domain Detection of Audio Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake detection has gained significant attention across audio, text, and image modalities, with high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake. However, identifying the exact source--such as the system or model behind a deepfake--remains a less studied problem. In this paper, we take a significant step forward in audio deepfake model attribution or source tracing by proposing a training-free, green AI approach based entirely on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Leveraging a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model, we show that grouping samples from the same generator is straightforward--we obtain an 0.93 F1-score across five deepfake datasets. The method also demonstrates strong out-of-domain (OOD) detection, effectively identifying samples from unseen models at an F1-score of 0.84.
  We further analyse these results in a multi-dimensional approach and provide additional insights. All code and data protocols used in this work are available in our open repository: https://github.com/adrianastan/tada/.</description>

      <title>Audio-Aware Large Language Models as Judges for Speaking Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs, even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking style and generating natural dialogues.</description>

      <title>CO-VADA: A Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach for Fair Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools, making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER systems.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Prompt Biasing for Contextualized End-to-End ASR Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced significantly yet still struggles with rare and domain-specific entities. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient prompt-based biasing technique for contextualized ASR, enhancing recognition accuracy by leverage a unified multitask learning framework. The approach comprises two key components: a prompt biasing model which is trained to determine when to focus on entities in prompt, and a entity filtering mechanism which efficiently filters out irrelevant entities. Our method significantly enhances ASR accuracy on entities, achieving a relative 30.7% and 18.0% reduction in Entity Word Error Rate compared to the baseline model with shallow fusion on in-house domain dataset with small and large entity lists, respectively. The primary advantage of this method lies in its efficiency and simplicity without any structure change, making it lightweight and highly efficient.</description>

      <title>SAVVY: Spatial Awareness via Audio-Visual LLMs through Seeing and Hearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Improving Neural Diarization through Speaker Attribute Attractors and Local Dependency Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach, Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.</description>

      <title>Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization.</description>

      <title>DeepFake Doctor: Diagnosing and Treating Audio-Video Fake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal (audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset. Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy. Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of audio-video DeepFake detection.</description>

      <title>WAKE: Watermarking Audio with Key Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning advances in audio generation, challenges in audio security and copyright protection highlight the need for robust audio watermarking. Recent neural network-based methods have made progress but still face three main issues: preventing unauthorized access, decoding initial watermarks after multiple embeddings, and embedding varying lengths of watermarks. To address these issues, we propose WAKE, the first key-controllable audio watermark framework. WAKE embeds watermarks using specific keys and recovers them with corresponding keys, enhancing security by making incorrect key decoding impossible. It also resolves the overwriting issue by allowing watermark decoding after multiple embeddings and supports variable-length watermark insertion. WAKE outperforms existing models in both watermarked audio quality and watermark detection accuracy. Code, more results, and demo page: https://thuhcsi.github.io/WAKE.</description>

      <title>WhisQ: Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Text-to-Music MOS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA. Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.</description>

      <title>Label-Context-Dependent Internal Language Model Estimation for CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than 13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.</description>

      <title>NAT: Neural Acoustic Transfer for Interactive Scenes in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However, these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions, making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and advanced audio production.</description>

      <title>Audiobox TTA-RAG: Improving Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Text-To-Audio with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on improving Text-To-Audio (TTA) generation on zero-shot and few-shot settings (i.e. generating unseen or uncommon audio events). Inspired by the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Large Language Models, we propose Audiobox TTA-RAG, a novel retrieval-augmented TTA approach based on Audiobox, a flow-matching audio generation model. Unlike the vanilla Audiobox TTA solution that generates audio conditioned on text only, we extend the TTA process by augmenting the conditioning input with both text and retrieved audio samples. Our retrieval method does not require the external database to have labeled audio, offering more practical use cases. We show that the proposed model can effectively leverage the retrieved audio samples and significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot TTA performance, with large margins on multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the ability to generate semantically aligned audio for the in-domain setting.</description>

      <title>ARiSE: Auto-Regressive Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ARiSE, an auto-regressive algorithm for multi-channel speech enhancement. ARiSE improves existing deep neural network (DNN) based frame-online multi-channel speech enhancement models by introducing auto-regressive connections, where the estimated target speech at previous frames is leveraged as extra input features to help the DNN estimate the target speech at the current frame. The extra input features can be derived from (a) the estimated target speech in previous frames; and (b) a beamformed mixture with the beamformer computed based on the previous estimated target speech. On the other hand, naively training the DNN in an auto-regressive manner is very slow. To deal with this, we propose a parallel training mechanism to speed up the training. Evaluation results in noisy-reverberant conditions show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quality Assessment of Noisy and Enhanced Speech with Limited Data: UWB-NTIS System for VoiceMOS 2024 and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this preprint, we present the UWB-NTIS-TTS team's submission to Track 3 of the VoiceMOS 2024 Challenge, the goal of which was to automatically assess the speech quality of noisy and de-noised speech in terms of the ITU-T P.835 metrics of "SIG", "BAK", and "OVRL". Our proposed system, based on wav2vec 2.0, placed among the top systems in the challenge, achieving the best prediction of the BAK scores (background noise intrusiveness), the second-best prediction of the OVRL score (overall audio quality), and the third-best prediction of SIG (speech signal quality) out of the five participating systems. We describe our approach, such as the two-stage fine-tuning process we used to contend with the challenge's very limiting restrictions on allowable training data, and present the results achieved both on the VoiceMOS 2024 Challenge data and on the recently released CHiME 7 - UDASE dataset.</description>

      <title>TMT: Tri-Modal Translation between Speech, Image, and Text by Processing Different Modalities as Different Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.</description>

      <title>WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Grained Guidance for Diffusion Model Based Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing generative models to create or conditionally create symbolic music presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, which enables real-time interactive generation.</description>

      <title>Who Can Withstand Chat-Audio Attacks? An Evaluation Benchmark for Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large audio-language models (LALMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the vulnerabilities of LALMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LALMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LALMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others, using three distinct evaluation methods on the CAA benchmark. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the impact of four types of audio attacks on the performance of these models, demonstrating that GPT-4o exhibits the highest level of resilience.

      <title>DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec. Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.</description>

      <title>Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have shown competitive results in audio classification by learning rich semantic representations through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, thereby revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAE models. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap requires more than domain-specific pretraining data; adapting the entire training pipeline is crucial. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37%$_\text{p}$ in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately 3.3%$_\text{p}$ on average across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.</description>

      <title>Advancing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech Intelligibility across Diverse Domains via Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems, despite using extensive pre-training, often struggle in challenging scenarios such as tongue twisters, repeated words, code-switching, and cross-lingual synthesis, leading to intelligibility issues. To address these limitations, this paper leverages preference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of out-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further improvements through iterative alignment based on Ints. Audio samples are available at https://intalign.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation Based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is an important speech signal processing technology that can remove echoes from microphone signals to enable natural-sounding full-duplex speech communication. While single-channel AEC is widely adopted, multi-channel AEC can leverage spatial cues afforded by multiple microphones to achieve better performance. Existing multi-channel AEC approaches typically combine beamforming with deep neural networks (DNN). This work proposes a two-stage algorithm that enhances multi-channel AEC by incorporating sound source directional cues. Specifically, a lightweight DNN is first trained to predict the sound source directions, and then the predicted directional information, multi-channel microphone signals, and single-channel far-end signal are jointly fed into an AEC network to estimate the near-end signal. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches and exhibits robust generalization across diverse acoustic environments.</description>
