      <title>Positive Univariate Polynomials: SOS certificates, algorithms, bit complexity, and T-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certificates of positivity for univariate polynomials with rational coefficients that are positive over (an interval of) $\mathbb{R}$, given as weighted sums of squares (SOS) of rational polynomials. We build on the algorithm of Chevillard, Harrison, Joldes, and Lauter~\cite{chml-usos-alg-11}, which we call \usos. For a polynomial of degree~$d$ and coefficient bitsize~$\tau$, we show that a rational weighted SOS representation can be computed in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(d^3 + d^2 \tau)$ bit operations, and the certificate has bitsize $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2 \tau)$. This improves the best-known bounds by a factor~$d$ and completes previous analyses. We also extend the method to positivity over arbitrary rational intervals, again saving a factor~$d$. For univariate rational polynomials we further introduce \emph{perturbed SOS certificates}. These consist of a sum of two rational squares approximating the input polynomial so that nonnegativity of the approximation implies that of the original. Their computation has the same bit complexity and certificate size as in the weighted SOS case. We also investigate structural properties of these SOS decompositions. Using the classical fact that any nonnegative univariate real polynomial is a sum of two real squares, we prove that the summands form an interlacing pair. Their real roots correspond to the Karlin points of the original polynomial, linking our construction to the T-systems of Karlin~\cite{Karlin-repr-pos-63}. This enables explicit computation of such decompositions, whereas only existential results were previously known. We obtain analogous results for positivity over $(0,\infty)$ and thus over arbitrary real intervals. Finally, we present an open-source Maple implementation of \usos and report experiments on diverse inputs that demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Derandomised tensor product gap amplification for quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum PCP conjecture asks whether it is QMA-hard to distinguish between high- and low-energy Hamiltonians even when the gap between "high" and "low" energy is large (constant). A natural proof strategy is gap amplification: start from the fact that high- and low-energy Hamiltonians are hard to distinguish if the gap is small (inverse polynomial) and amplify the Hamiltonians to increase the energy gap while preserving hardness. Such a gap amplification procedure is at the heart of Dinur's proof of the classical PCP theorem. In this work, following Dinur's model, we introduce a new quantum gap amplification procedure for Hamiltonians which uses random walks on expander graphs to derandomise (subsample the terms of) the tensor product amplification of a Hamiltonian. Curiously, our analysis relies on a new technique inspired by quantum de Finetti theorems, which have previously been used to rule out certain approaches to the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Unit Disk Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned one of c colors, where V(G) can be written as a union of a total of c subsets V_{1},...,V_{c} and V_{i} denotes the set of vertices of color i. A subset S of V(G) is called a selective subset if, for every i, every vertex v in V_{i} has at least one nearest neighbor in $S \cup (V(G) \setminus V_{i})$ that also lies in V_{i}. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem asks for a selective subset of minimum size.
  We show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs, even when c=2. As a consequence, the problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless P = NP. On the positive side, we present a PTAS for unit disk graphs, which works without requiring a geometric representation and applies for arbitrary c. We further prove that MSS remains NP-complete in unit disk graphs for arbitrary c. In addition, we show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on circle graphs, even when c=2.</description>

      <title>Formal Framework for Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by notions of quantum heuristics and by average-case rather than worst-case algorithmic analysis, we define quantum computational advantage in terms of individual problem instances. Inspired by the classical notions of Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity, we define their quantum versions. This allows us to define queasy instances of computational problems, like e.g. Satisfiability and Factoring, as those whose quantum instance complexity is significantly smaller than their classical instance complexity. These instances indicate quantum advantage: they are easy to solve on a quantum computer, but classical algorithms struggle (they feel queasy). Via a reduction from Factoring, we prove the existence of queasy Satisfiability instances; specifically, these instances are maximally queasy (under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions). Further, we show that there is exponential algorithmic utility in the queasiness of a quantum algorithm. This formal framework serves as a beacon that guides the hunt for quantum advantage in practice, and moreover, because its focus lies on single instances, it can lead to new ways of designing quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Succinct Perfect Zero-knowledge for MIP*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their recent breakthrough result, Slofstra and the second author show that there is a two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE (STOC'24). We build on their result to show that there exists a succinct two-player one-round perfect zero-knowledge MIP* protocol for RE against dishonest verifiers with polylog question size and O(1) answer size, or with O(1) question size and polylog answer size. To prove our result, we study the three central compression techniques underlying the MIP*=RE proof (Ji et al. '20): question reduction, oracularization, and answer reduction. We show that question reduction preserves the perfect (as well as statistical and computational) zero-knowledge properties of the original protocol against dishonest verifiers, and oracularization and answer reduction preserve the perfect (as well as statistical and computational) zero-knowledge properties of the original protocol against honest verifiers. Secondly, we show that every constraint-constraint binary constraint system (BCS) nonlocal game, which provides a quantum information characterization of MIP*, can be converted to a synchronous constraint-variable BCS game to preserve perfect completeness for our compression. Lastly, we present a parametrized perfect-zero-knowledge transformation of MIP* protocols, which generalizes the transformation in (Slofstra and Kieran STOC'24) . This transformation allows us to preserve the zero-knowledge property against dishonest verifiers in the recursively oracularized protocols in our compression.</description>
