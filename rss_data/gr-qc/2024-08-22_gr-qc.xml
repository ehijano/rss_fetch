      <title>Correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal frequencies for rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the proper oscillation frequencies of black holes (quasinormal modes) and the grey-body factors, which determine the scattering properties of black holes, represent two distinct spectral problems with different boundary conditions, a recent study has revealed an intrinsic connection between these quantities. We have shown that the correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, previously established for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes, also extends to general parametrized axially symmetric black holes. This correspondence is limited to non-superradiant waves.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamic relation for dissipative and non-dissipative universes in a flat FLRW cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clarify a holographic modified thermodynamic relation, the present study applies a general formulation for cosmological equations in a flat FLRW universe to the first law of thermodynamics, using the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm{BH}}$ and a dynamical Kodama-Hayward temperature $T_{\rm{KH}}$. For the general formulation, both an effective pressure $p_{e}$ of cosmological fluids for dissipative universes (e.g., bulk viscous cosmology) and an extra driving term $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ for non-dissipative universes (e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology) are phenomenologically assumed. When $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is constant, the modified thermodynamic relation is equivalent to the formulation of the first law in standard cosmology. One side of this modified relation describes thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and can be divided into two time-derivative terms, namely $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, where $\rho$ is the mass density of cosmological fluids and $V$ is the Hubble volume. Using the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm{GH}}$, the other side of this relation, $T_{\rm{KH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, can be formulated as the sum of $T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$ and $[(T_{\rm{KH}}/T_{\rm{GH}}) -1] T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, which are equivalent to the $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, respectively, with the magnitude of the $\dot{V}$ term being proportional to the square of the $\dot{\rho}$ term. In addition, the modified thermodynamic relation for constant $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is examined by applying the equipartition law of energy on the horizon. This modified thermodynamic relation reduces to a kind of extended holographic-like connection when a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ universe is considered. The evolution of thermodynamic quantities is also discussed, using a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ model, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 108, 083515 (2023) (arXiv:2306.11285)].</description>

      <title>Parametrized-Post-Newtonian Test of Black Hole Spacetime for Galactic Center Massive Black Hole Sgr A*: Formulation and $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) test of a black hole spacetime using observational data of the star S0-2/S2 orbiting the massive black hole at our galactic center Sgr A*. After introducing our PPN model of black hole spacetime, we report the result of $\chi^2$ fitting of the PPN model with the observational data. A new finding through our PPN model is a detectability of the gravitational lens effect on the null geodesics connecting S0-2 and observer under the present observational uncertainties, if a PPN parameter is about one order larger than the value for general relativity case. On the other hand, the effect of black hole spin on the S0-2's motion is not detectable. Thus our present PPN test is performed with spherically symmetric vacuum black hole spacetime. The resultant value of the PPN parameter, which corresponds to the minimum $\chi^2$, implies that the gravitational field of Sgr A* is not of Schwarzschild metric or that the existence of sufficient amount of dark matters around Sgr A*. However, the difference between the minimum $\chi^2$ and the $\chi^2$ of Schwarzschild case is not large enough to ensure a statistical significance of non-Schwarzschild result. A more precise statistical analysis than $\chi^2$ statistics is necessary to extract a statistically significant information of the gravitational field of Sgr A* from present observational data. We will report a result by a Bayesian analysis in next paper.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering of massive scalar field due to magnetically charged rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are well known to amplify the perturbing bosonic fields in certain parameter spaces. This phenomenon is popularly known as superradiance. In addition to rotation in the spacetime, charge plays a crucial role in the amplification process. In the present study, we have considered the spacetime of a magnetically charged rotating black hole emerging from the coupling of nonlinear electromagnetic field configuration to gravity. Due to this black hole spacetime, we have studied the scattering states of a massive scalar field and investigated the superradiant amplification process. We find that the magnetic charge of the spacetime affects the magnitude of the amplification and also significantly enlarges the allowed frequency ranges for which superradiance happens. In comparison, our analysis reveals that some of the behaviours are quite similar to what has been found in the case of the Kerr-Newmann black hole. Moreover, in specific parameter spaces, we observe exact similarities, which could imply a probable correspondence between the magnetically charged black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole in certain scenarios. In addition to this, we have investigated the superradiant instability regime due to the massive potential barrier and also compared our results with that of the Kerr-Newmann black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing effect of black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the gravitational lensing effects of two quantum-modified black hole models recently proposed in effective quantum gravity. The light deflection angles in both the weak field limit and the strong field limit are calculated. Furthermore, we use the data of the supermassive black holes SgrA* and M87* and calculate the lensing observables in the strong field limit. We find that the quantum parameter plays a role analogous to the electric charge in the weak gravitational lensing, whereas in the strong field limit, the effect of the quantum parameter on the deflection angle, the angular separation and the relative magnification is opposite to that of the electric charge, the scalar charge and the quantum parameters in some gravity theories. The results indicate the discrepancies between the classical black holes and the two quantum-modified black hole models that depend on the quantum correction, making them a valuable tool for differentiating between these black hole models.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Mechanics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the phase space of a spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the covariant phase space formalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the $d$-dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine their commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The first of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is responsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been well-documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood, being integrable for $d \geq 2$ only if we allow for field-dependent diffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.</description>

      <title>Across-Horizon Propagation and Infinite Time-Dilation: An Independent Approach to Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformal scalar propagator as an explicit function of the Schwarzschild black-hole space-time has been established in the preceding three projects. The present project examines the precise relation which that propagator has to the amplitude the Schwarzschild black hole emit a scalar particle in a particular mode of positive energy. It is thereby established that the effect of infinite time-dilation on the event horizon results in both, the thermal radiation in the background of a static exterior space-time geometry and the detraction from thermality if energy-conservation is properly imposed as a constraint on scalar propagation. The derivation of the latter signifies an equivalent approach to the result of Parikh and Wilczek from the semi-classical perspective of the distant observer. From that perspective for that matter, Hawking radiation emerges in both contexts as the exclusive consequence of infinite time-dilation on the event horizon. These results are consistent with Hawking radiation as the exclusive consequence of the causal structure of the Schwarzschild black-hole space-time both, in a static exterior geometry and in such dynamical exterior geometry as energy-conservation signifies. The extension of the thermal case to other spin-fields and black-hole geometries is discussed.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Supergravity Spectrum of AdS$_5$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embed Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes into $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged supergravity and study quadratic fluctuations around the black hole backgrounds of all fields in the larger theory. The equations of motion of the perturbations are partially diagonalized by the group theory of broken symmetry. Nearly all fields in theory have non-minimal couplings, so their equations of motion are not merely massive Klein-Gordon equations with minimal coupling to background gauge fields, and their analogues for fields with spin. In the special case of extremal black holes we identify specific modes of instability, some of which touch supersymmetric locus. For example, we identify scalar fields in supergravity that condense in the near horizon region and transition the black hole into a superconducting phase. We also identify supergravity modes that are susceptible to superradiant instability.</description>

      <title>Powerful explosions from the collapse of rotating supermassive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform new general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for collapses of rotating supermassive star cores with an approximate nuclear burning up to carbon and a detailed equation of state. For all the models we investigate, the energy generation by nuclear burning plays only a minor role, leading to the formation of a black hole without a nuclear-powered explosion. For rotating models, however, the stellar explosion associated with shock heating is driven from a torus, which forms after the black hole formation. The explosion energy is up to $10^{-4}$ of the mass energy of the supermassive star cores ($\sim 10^{55}-10^{56}$ erg). We find that, even if we increase the rotational angular momentum of the progenitor, the ejecta mass saturates at $\sim 1$\% of the total mass of the initial stellar core. The average ejecta velocity also saturates at $\approx 20\%$ of the speed of light. As a result, the ejecta kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the initial mass of the supermassive star core for the rapidly rotating case. We also perform viscous hydrodynamics simulations for exploring the evolution of the remnant torus. Although the viscous heating drives an outflow from the torus, we find that its effect is subdominant in terms of the kinetic energy because of the small velocity ($\approx 0.07c$) of the ejecta component.</description>

      <title>Threshold mass of the general relativistic instability for supermassive star cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability during the stellar evolution if the mass is larger than $\sim 3 \times 10^4M_\odot$. Spherical SMS cores in the helium burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron-positron pair instability if the mass is larger than $\sim 1\times 10^4M_\odot$. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of $\sim 5$, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than $\sim 10^4M_\odot$ the collapse is triggered by the pair-instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas the SMS cores in the helium burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies adjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Classicality of Stochastic Noise Away From Quasi-de Sitter Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a coarse-grained scalar field living on a de~Sitter (dS) background exhibits classical stochastic behavior, driven by a noise whose amplitude is set by the Hubble constant $H$. The coarse-graining is achieved by discarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\sigma H$ and demanding that $\sigma \ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of state parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the noise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with constant $w &lt; -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge for $-5/3 &lt; w &lt; -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach $w = -1/3$, the constraint $\sigma \ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs ($\sigma \sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of the noise depends on $\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Realistic Gravitational Waveforms in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of relaxing the assumption that gravitational waves composing the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) are uncorrelated between frequencies in analyses of the data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). While individual monochromatic plane waves are often a good approximation, a background composed of astrophysical sources cannot be monochromatic since an infinite plane wave carries no signal. We consider how relaxing this assumption allows us to extract potential information about modified dispersion relations and other fundamental physics questions, as both the group and phase velocity of waves become relevant. After developing the formalism we carry out simple Gaussian wavepacket examples and then consider more realistic waveforms, such as that from binary inspirals. When the frequency evolves only slowly across the PTA temporal baseline, the monochromatic assumption at an effective mean frequency remains a good approximation and we provide scaling relations that characterize its accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Given a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of a certain regularity defined on some open subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, it is a classical problem of analysis to investigate whether the function can be extended to all of $\mathbb{R}^m$ in a certain regularity class. If an extension exists and is continuous, then certainly it is uniquely determined on the closure of $A$. A similar problem arises in general relativity for Lorentzian manifolds instead of functions on $\mathbb{R}^m$. It is well-known, however, that even if the extension of a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is analytic, various choices are in general possible at the boundary. This paper establishes a uniqueness condition for extensions of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ with a focus on low regularities: any two extensions which are anchored by an inextendible causal curve $\gamma : [-1,0) \to M$ in the sense that $\gamma$ has limit points in both extensions, must agree locally around those limit points on the boundary as long as the extensions are at least locally Lipschitz continuous. We also show that this is sharp: anchored extensions which are only H\"older continuous do in general not enjoy this local uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>

Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background with space-borne networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single gravitational-wave detectors face inherent limitations in detecting the anisotropy of the stochastic background. In this work, we explore the sensitivity to anisotropic backgrounds with a network of space-borne detectors. We find that the separation between detectors plays an important role in determining the sensitivity. For the first time, we observe as large as three orders of magnitude enhancement in detection sensitivity for the multipoles with $l=5$ and 6, compared to coinciding detectors. Coordinating and optimizing the separation between two space-borne detectors can significantly enhance the network's sensitivity to the multipole components of the stochastic background. For the TianQin + LISA network, benefiting from detector separation, it is possible to achieve sensitivity levels of 2-3 orders of magnitude better than using TianQin or LISA detector alone. These findings pave the way to uncover the underlying physics of anisotropy through gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Scalar Cosmological Perturbations from Quantum Gravitational Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge at the interface of quantum gravity and cosmology is to explain the emergence of the large-scale structure of the Universe from Planck scale physics. In this letter, we extract the dynamics of scalar isotropic cosmological perturbations from full quantum gravity, as described by the causally complete Barrett-Crane group field theory model. From the perspective of the underlying quantum gravity theory, cosmological perturbations are represented as nearest-neighbor two-body entanglement of group field theory quanta. Their effective dynamics is obtained via mean-field methods and described relationally with respect to a causally coupled physical Lorentz frame. We quantitatively study these effective dynamical equations and show that at low energies they are perfectly consistent with those of General Relativity, while for trans-Planckian scales quantum effects become important. These results therefore not only provide crucial insights into the potentially purely quantum gravitational nature of cosmological perturbations, but also offer rich phenomenological implications for the physics of the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the behavior of light ray trajectories in the exterior geometry of a rotating black hole within the Rastall theory of gravity, which is surrounded by an inhomogeneous anisotropic electronic cold plasma. By specifying the plasma's frequency profile, we derive fully analytical solutions for the temporal evolution of spacetime coordinates using elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions. These solutions illustrate various possible orbits. Throughout the study, we compare the results with those in the vacuum case, emphasizing the influence of plasma. Additionally, we utilize the analytical solutions to establish the lens equation for the considered spacetime. The investigation also addresses the significance of spherical photon orbits on critical trajectories, by presenting several examples.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological scalar fields using orbital networks of quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose to detect the interaction of a hypothetical coherently evolving cosmological scalar field with an orbital network of quantum sensors, focusing on the GPS satellite network as a test example. Cosmological scenarios, such as a scalar-tensor theory for dark energy or the axi-Higgs model, suggest that such a field may exist. As this field would be (approximately) at rest in the CMB frame, it would exhibit a dipole as a result of the movement of our terrestrial observers relative to the CMB. While the current sensitivity of the GPS network is insufficient to detect a cosmological dipole, future networks of quantum sensors on heliocentric orbits, using state-of-the-art atomic clocks, can reach and exceed this requirement.</description>

      <title>Sky marginalization in black hole spectroscopy and tests of the area theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct observation of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers has made it possible to test the laws of black hole thermodynamics using real astrophysical sources. These tests rely on accurate and unbiased parameter estimates from the pre and postmerger portions of a signal. Due to numerical complications, previous analyses have fixed the sky location and coalescence time when independently estimating the parameters of the pre and postmerger signal. Here we overcome the numerical complications and present a novel method of marginalizing over sky location and coalescence time. Doing so, we find that it is not possible to model only the pre or postmerger portions of the signal while marginalizing over timing uncertainty. We surmount this problem by simultaneously yet independently modeling the pre and postmerger signal, with only the sky location and coalescence time being shared between the models. This allows us to marginalize over all parameters. We use our method to measure the change in area $\Delta A_{\rm measured} = A_f - A_i$ between the final and initial black holes in the BBH merger GW150914. To measure the final black hole's area $A_f$ we do an analysis using quasinormal modes (QNMs) to model the postmerger signal, and another analysis using the postmerger portion of an inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) template. We find excellent agreement with expectations from general relativity. The Hawking area theorem (which states that $A_f \geq A_i$) is confirmed to $95.4\%$ and $99.5\%$ confidence using the QNM and IMR postmerger models, respectively. Both models yield $\Delta A_{\rm measured} / \Delta A_{\rm expected} \sim 1$, where $\Delta A_{\rm expected}$ is the expected change in area derived from fits to numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background in the Strong Signal Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak-signal limit is often used in estimating stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) intensities. This approximation fails and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be much weaker when background signals are loud compared to the detector noise. In this work, we highlight this limitation for the SGWB detection using space-borne detector networks. For the TianQin + LISA network, the SNR estimated under the weak-signal limit might be off by as large as an order of magnitude. Contour plots of SNR over the parameter spaces are also presented to indicate regions susceptible to this discrepancy. Our results suggest that DA and DB type extragalactic double white dwarfs may yield an SGWB with SNR surpassing 100 after 1 year of operation in the weak-signal-limit scenario, with a redshift-independent merger rate of about $500\,\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,Myr^{-1}}$. In fact, this value falls significantly below the necessary threshold. Similar influences arise for first-order phase transitions, yet pinning down parameter regions remains formidable due to model uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: A scalar field with an exponential potential has been proposed as a model of inflation (called power-law inflation). Although it admits an exact solution, the integrability of the system has not been shown.We uncover the hidden symmetries behind the system by utilising the Eisenhart lift of field theories. We find that a conformal Killing vector field in the field space exists only for a particular combination of exponential functions that includes a single exponential potential. This implies the existence of additional conserved quantity and explains the integrability of the system.</description>

      <title>New search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <title>Microscale torsion resonators for short-range gravity experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring gravitational interactions on sub-100-$\mu$m length scales offers a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, short-range gravity experiments are limited by the ability to position sufficiently massive objects to within small separation distances. Here we propose mass-loaded silicon nitride ribbons as a platform for testing the gravitational inverse square law at separations currently inaccessible with traditional torsion balances. These microscale torsion resonators benefit from low thermal noise due to strain-induced dissipation dilution while maintaining compact size (&lt;100$\,\mu$g) to allow close approach. Considering an experiment combining a 40$\,\mu$g torsion resonator with a source mass of comparable size (130$\,\mu$g) at separations down to 25$\,\mu$m, and including limits from thermomechanical noise and systematic uncertainty, we predict these devices can set novel constraints on Yukawa interactions within the 1-100$\,\mu$m range.</description>

Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fuzzy spaces (as special examples of noncommutative manifolds) with their quasicoherent states in order to find their pertinent metrics. We show that they are naturally endowed with two natural "quantum metrics" which are associated with quantum fluctuations of "paths". The first one provides the length the mean path whereas the second one provides the average length of the fluctuated paths. Onto the classical manifold associated with the quasicoherent state (manifold of the mean values of the coordinate observables in the state minimising their quantum uncertainties) these two metrics provides two minimising geodesic equations. Moreover, fuzzy spaces being not torsion free, we have also two different autoparallel geodesic equations associated with two different adiabatic regimes in the move of a probe onto the fuzzy space. We apply these mathematical results to quantum gravity in BFSS matrix models, and to the quantum information theory of a controlled qubit submitted to noises of a large quantum environment.</description>

Abstract: We employ holography to investigate Liu-Mezei renormalization group monotones in conformal field theories influenced by massive flavor degrees of freedom. We examine the entanglement entropy of a spherical subregion in three holographic field theories - $\mathcal{N}=1$ Klebanov-Witten theory, $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, and ABJM theory - with fundamental flavor. The gravity dual of massive unquenched flavor is described by dynamical D-branes, and we solve their backreaction in the smeared approximation. We compute entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in these backreacted geometries. Our findings indicate that the Liu-Mezei A- and F-functions decrease monotonically to leading order in the number of flavors across all examples. Additionally, we calculate the leading flavor contribution to entanglement entropy using an alternative probe brane method that does not require knowledge of backreaction in the bulk geometries. These results consistently match with backreacted calculations in all cases, assuming omission of a specific IR boundary term stemming from a total derivative.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble tension in Yukawa cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Yukawa cosmology, a recent discovery revealed a relationship between baryonic matter and the dark sector. The relation is described by the parameter {\alpha} and the long-range interaction parameter {\lambda} - an intrinsic property of the graviton. Applying the uncertainty relation to the graviton raises a compelling question: Is there a quantum mechanical limit to the measurement precision of the Hubble constant (H0)? We argue that the uncertainty relation for the graviton wavelength {\lambda} can be used to explain a running of H0 with redshift. We show that the uncertainty in time has an inverse correlation with the value of the Hubble constant. That means that the measurement of the Hubble constant is intrinsically linked to length scales (redshift) and is connected to the uncertainty in time. On cosmological scales, we found that the uncertainty in time is related to the look-back time quantity. For measurements with a high redshift value, there is more uncertainty in time, which leads to a smaller value for the Hubble constant. Conversely, there is less uncertainty in time for local measurements with a smaller redshift value, resulting in a higher value for the Hubble constant. Therefore, due to the uncertainty relation, the Hubble tension is believed to arise from fundamental limitations inherent in cosmological measurements. Finally, our findings indicate that the mass of the graviton fluctuates with specific scales, suggesting a possible mass-varying mechanism for the graviton.</description>

      <title>Static neutral black holes in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13461</link>

Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity theory, a modified gravity theory that nonminimally couples a KR field with a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the gravitational field, can spontaneously break the Lorentz symmetry of gravity. In a recent work, Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. D 108, 124004 (2023)] successfully derived Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions both with and without a nonzero cosmological constant within the framework of KR gravity. However, their analysis did not address the more general case of static, neutral, spherically symmetric black holes. In this paper, we fill this gap by resolving the field equations to construct more general static, neutral, spherically symmetric black hole solutions both with and without a nonzero cosmological constant. Our black hole solutions are shown to obey the first law and the Bekenstein-Smarr mass formulas of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that our static neutral spherically symmetric AdS black hole does not always satisfy the reverse isoperimetric inequality (RII), as the isoperimetric ratio can be larger or smaller than unity depending on the placement of the solution parameters within the parameter space. This behavior contrasts with the above-mentioned Schwarzschild-like AdS black hole in the KR gravity theory, which always obeys the RII. Significantly, the present more general static, neutral, spherically symmetric AdS black hole is the first example of a static AdS black hole that can violate the RII.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, to obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). For this we use a Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda &gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is "pure gauge", the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields and scales in the theory have a geometric origin, with no added matter or Weyl scalar fields compensators.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim25~(11)\text{ GeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>
