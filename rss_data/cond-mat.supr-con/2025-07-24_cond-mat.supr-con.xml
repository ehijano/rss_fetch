      <title>Superconductivity in kagome metals due to soft loop-current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that soft fluctuations of translation symmetry-breaking loop currents provide a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in kagome metals that naturally addresses the multiple superconducting phases observed under pressure. Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness of superconductors with delicate topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider superconductivity in two-dimensional delicate topological bands, where the total Chern number vanishes but the Brillouin zone can be divided into subregions with a quantized nontrivial Chern number. We formulate a lower bound on the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight in terms of the sum of the absolute values of these sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers. We verify this bound in Chern dartboard insulators, where the delicate topology is protected by mirror symmetry. In iso-orbital models, where the mirror representation is the same along all high-symmetry lines, the lower bound increases linearly with the number of mirror planes. This work points to delicate bands as promising candidates for particularly stable superconductivity, especially in narrow bands where the kinetic energy is suppressed due to lattice effects.</description>

      <title>A Partially Massless Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive. At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.</description>

      <title>Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier with Inverse Kerr Phase Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) have emerged as highly versatile devices, offering broadband amplification with quantum-limited noise performance. They hold significant potential for addressing the readout bottleneck in prototype quantum computers, enabling scalability. Key challenges with this technology include achieving sufficient gain with minimal gain ripple while maintaining low noise performance. Efficient phase matching between a weak signal and a strong pump over the entire length of the TWPA is critical to overcoming these challenges. We present an experimental demonstration of the inverse Kerr phase matching technique in a TWPA, first proposed in Ref. Phys. Rev. Appl. 4, 024014. This method addresses several limitations of conventional dispersion engineering approaches of phase matching in the four-wave mixing parametric process in TWPAs. Most notably the existence of an unusable region of gain near the pump frequency which typically corresponds to the region of most optimal phase matching and maximum gain. The inverse Kerr phase matching approach, allows for greater frequency separation between the region of optimal gain and pump, \textit{in situ} tunability of the pump, minimal gain ripple, and a compact footprint which reduces losses. A TWPA employing the inverse Kerr phase matching technique experimentally demonstrated 20 dB of gain over a 3 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, with a tunable bandwidth of 8 GHz, minimal gain ripple, and near quantum-limited noise performance, with 1.5 photons of added noise.</description>

      <title>Dopant-induced stabilization of three-dimensional charge order in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic mechanisms behind the stabilization of three-dimensional (3D) charge order by Pr doping in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO7). Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted ionic substitution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of light and superlight bipolarons in extended Hubbard-Holstein models on face- and body-centered-cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices is investigated using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and $V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling current correlation $\overline{\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\rangle}$. Differentiating this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Transport through Nodal Surface Semimetal-Superconductor junction in absence/presence of light irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum tunnelling via s-wave superconductor (SC) junction with a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) where a nonsymmorphic symmetry forces the nodal surfaces to stick to the Brillouin Zone boundary. Due to their unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing, the charge carriers in the NSSM display many unorthodox behavior in the nature of Andreev as well as normal reflections at the SC junction interface. We investigate such behaviors for different incident orientations for both subgap and supergap energies where monotonic decays/rises of reflectance with incident energy or angle of incidences are often not followed. We also consider irradiation via light with circular and linear polarization on such systems following a Floquet approach in the limit of high frequency irradiation and probe the stroboscopic temporal evolution of the transport parameters. Our results indicate many nontrivial Andreev transport features including near-depletion of the subgap conductivities. All these nontrivialities can be tested in a cold atom set-up on optical lattices and well experimented for quantum information processing purpose.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and soft phonon evolution in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.</description>

Abstract: Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our ab initio results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.</description>

      <title>Mutual control of critical temperature, residual resistance ratio, stress, and roughness for sputtered Nb films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>
