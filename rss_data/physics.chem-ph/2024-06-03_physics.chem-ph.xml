      <title>Solving multi-pole challenges in the GW100 benchmark enables precise low-scaling GW calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV with respect to standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Dynamics in Wigner Phase Space I : Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is a complete framework for quantum dynamic calculations that elegantly highlights connections with classical dynamics. In this series of two articles, building upon previous efforts, we derive the full hierarchy of approximate semiclassical (SC) dynamic methods for adiabatic and non-adiabatic problems in Wigner phase space. In paper I, focusing on adiabatic single surface processes, we derive the well-known Double Herman-Kluk (DHK) approximation for real-time correlation functions in Wigner phase space, and connect it to the Linearized SC (LSC) approximation through a stationary phase approximation. We exploit this relationship to introduce a new hybrid SC method, termed Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) that allows for a few important `system' degrees of freedom (dofs) to be treated at the DHK level, while treating the rest of the dofs (the `bath') at the LSC level. AHWD is shown to accurately capture quantum interference effects in models of coupled oscillators, and the decoherence of vibrational probability density of a model I$_2$ Morse oscillator coupled to an Ohmic thermal bath. We show that AHWD significantly mitigates the sign-problem and employs a reduced dimensional prefactor bringing calculations of complex system-bath problems within the reach of SC methods. Paper II focuses on extending Hybrid Wigner dynamics to nonadiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Dynamics in Wigner Phase Space II : Non-Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of two articles, we present approximate semiclassical (SC) dynamic methods for adiabatic and non-adiabatic problems in Wigner phase space. Focusing on adiabatic problems, the first article introduced the Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) method. It partitions the problem into a few important `system' degrees of freedom (dofs), that are treated at the Double Herman-Kluk (DHK) level, while treating the rest of the dofs (the `bath') in the classical limit. In this second article, with the use of Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping, an extension of Hybrid Wigner Dynamics to nonadiabatic problems, termed Nonadiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (NHWD), is introduced. Two different variants are presented differing in the choice of the quantized system. NHWD with a quantized electronic system [NHWD(E)] is shown to produce reliable results on scattering models and spin-boson models with weak coupling to nuclear modes. NHWD with a quantized vibronic system [NHWD(V)] is shown to improve on NHWD(E) for spin boson models with strong coupling to the nuclear modes. Both methods provide a rigorous avenue to systematically improve upon the widely used classical-limit SC dynamics for non-adiabatic problems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing EPR pulses for broadband excitation and refocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically optimize broadband pulse shapes that maximize Hahn echo amplitudes. Pulses are parameterized as neural networks (NN), nonlinear amplitude limited Fourier series (FS), and discrete time series (DT). These are compared to an optimized choice of the conventional hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse shape. A power constraint is included, as are realistic shape distortions due to power amplifier nonlinearity and the transfer function of the microwave resonator. We find that the NN, FS, and DT parameterizations perform equivalently, offer improvements over the best HS pulses, and contain a large number of equivalent optimal solutions, implying the flexibility to include further constraints or optimization goals in future designs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Exponential Ansatz for the Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles formed as a result of lattice distortions induced by charge carriers. The single-electron Holstein model captures the fundamentals of single polaron physics. We examine the power of the exponential ansatz for the polaron ground-state wavefunction in its coupled cluster, canonical transformation, and (canonically transformed) perturbative variants across the parameter space of the Holstein model. Our benchmark serves to guide future developments of polaron wavefunctions beyond the single-electron Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Explainable Data-driven Modeling of Adsorption Energy in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) in catalysis has spurred interest in leveraging these techniques to enhance catalyst design. Our study aims to bridge the gap between physics-based studies and data-driven methodologies by integrating ML techniques with eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, we employ two XAI techniques: Post-hoc XAI analysis and Symbolic Regression. These techniques help us unravel the correlation between adsorption energy and the properties of the adsorbate-catalyst system. Leveraging a large dataset such as the Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20), we employ a combination of shallow ML techniques and XAI methodologies. Our investigation involves utilizing multiple shallow machine learning techniques to predict adsorption energy, followed by post-hoc analysis for feature importance, inter-feature correlations, and the influence of various feature values on the prediction of adsorption energy. The post-hoc analysis reveals that adsorbate properties exert a greater influence than catalyst properties in our dataset. The top five features based on higher Shapley values are adsorbate electronegativity, the number of adsorbate atoms, catalyst electronegativity, effective coordination number, and the sum of atomic numbers of the adsorbate molecule. There is a positive correlation between catalyst and adsorbate electronegativity with the prediction of adsorption energy. Additionally, symbolic regression yields results consistent with SHAP analysis. It deduces a mathematical relationship indicating that the square of the catalyst electronegativity is directly proportional to the adsorption energy. These consistent correlations resemble those derived from physics-based equations in previous research. Our work establishes a robust framework that integrates ML techniques with XAI, leveraging large datasets like OC20 to enhance catalyst design through model explainability.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Machine Learning Discovered Nano-circuitry for Nonlinear Ion Transport in Nanoporous Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confined ion transport is involved in nanoporous ionic systems. However, it is challenging to mechanistically predict its electrical characteristics for rational system design and performance evaluation using electrical circuit model due to the gap between the circuit theory and the underlying physical chemistry. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can bridge this gap and produce physics-based nano-circuitry, based on equation discovery from the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulation results where an anomalous constructive diffusion-migration interplay of confined ions is unveiled. This bridging technique allows us to gain physical insights of ion dynamics in nanoporous electrodes, such as the non-ideal cyclic voltammetry.</description>

      <title>Bexcitonics: Quasi-particle approach to open quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features. Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons. The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the effective core potentials under the Fermionic neural network: first and second row elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning techniques has driven the emergence of a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo method (referred to as FermiNet), which has manifested high accuracy and strong predictive power in the electronic structure calculations of atoms, molecules as well as some periodic systems. Recently, the implementation of the effective core potential (ECP) scheme in it further facilitates more efffcient calculations in practice. But there still lack comprehensive assessments on the ECP's performance under the FermiNet. In this work, we set sail to ffll this gap by conducting extensive tests on the ffrst two row elements regarding their atomic spectral and molecular properties. Our major ffnding is that in general the qualities of ECPs have been correctly reffected under the FermiNet. Two recently built ECP tables, namely ccECP and eCEPP, seem to prevail on the overall performance. Speciffcally, ccECP performs slightly better on the spectral precision and covers more elements, while eCEPP is more systematically built from both shape and energy consistency, and better treats the core polarisation. On the other hand, the high accuracy of the all-electron calculations is hindered by the absence of relativistic effects as well as the numerical instabilities in some heavier elements. Finally, with further in-depth discussions, we generate possible directions for developing and improving the FermiNet in the near future.</description>

      <title>AI-enabled prediction of NMR spectroscopy: Deducing 2-D NMR of carbohydrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamic field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a transformative era for molecular studies. AI-driven NMR prediction, powered by advanced machine learning and predictive algorithms, has fundamentally reshaped the interpretation of NMR spectra. This innovation empowers us to forecast spectral patterns swiftly and accurately across a broad spectrum of molecular structures. Furthermore, the advent of generative modeling offers a groundbreaking approach, making it feasible to make informed prediction of 2D NMR from chemical language (such as SMILES, IUPAC Name). Our method mirrors the multifaceted nature of NMR imaging experiments, producing 2D NMRs for the same molecule based on different conditions, such as solvents and temperatures. Our methodology is versatile, catering to both monosaccharide-derived small molecules, oligosaccharides and large polysaccharides. A deeper exploration of the discrepancies in these predictions can provide insights into the influence of elements such as functional groups, repeating units, and the modification of the monomers on the outcomes. Given the complex nature involved in the generation of 2D NMRs, our objective is to fully leverage the potential of AI to enhance the precision, efficiency, and comprehensibility of NMR spectral analysis, ultimately advancing both the field of NMR spectroscopy and the broader realm of molecular research.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
