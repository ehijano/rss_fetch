      <title>Universal Collection of Euclidean Invariants between Pairs of Position-Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean E(3) equivariant neural networks that employ scalar fields on position-orientation space M(3) have been effectively applied to tasks such as predicting molecular dynamics and properties. To perform equivariant convolutional-like operations in these architectures one needs Euclidean invariant kernels on M(3) x M(3). In practice, a handcrafted collection of invariants is selected, and this collection is then fed into multilayer perceptrons to parametrize the kernels. We rigorously describe an optimal collection of 4 smooth scalar invariants on the whole of M(3) x M(3). With optimal we mean that the collection is independent and universal, meaning that all invariants are pertinent, and any invariant kernel is a function of them. We evaluate two collections of invariants, one universal and one not, using the PONITA neural network architecture. Our experiments show that using a collection of invariants that is universal positively impacts the accuracy of PONITA significantly.</description>

      <title>Roto-Translation Invariant Metrics on Position-Orientation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian metrics on the position-orientation space M(3) that are roto-translation group SE(3) invariant play a key role in image analysis tasks like enhancement, denoising, and segmentation. These metrics enable roto-translation equivariant algorithms, with the associated Riemannian distance often used in implementation.
  However, computing the Riemannian distance is costly, which makes it unsuitable in situations where constant recomputation is needed. We propose the mav (minimal angular velocity) distance, defined as the Riemannian length of a geometrically meaningful curve, as a practical alternative.
  We see an application of the mav distance in geometric deep learning. Namely, neural networks architectures such as PONITA, relies on geometric invariants to create their roto-translation equivariant model. The mav distance offers a trainable invariant, with the parameters that determine the Riemannian metric acting as learnable weights.
  In this paper we: 1) classify and parametrize all SE(3) invariant metrics on M(3), 2) describes how to efficiently calculate the mav distance, and 3) investigate if including the mav distance within PONITA can positively impact its accuracy in predicting molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Remarks on minimal hypersurfaces in gradient Ricci soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any compact 2-sided smooth minimal hypersurface in the gradient Ricci soliton $(M^{n},g,f)$ with scalar curvature $R\geq(n-1)\lambda$ must have vanished second fundamental form and vanished normal Ricci curvature. For steady and shrinking gradient Ricci solitons with scalar curvature $R\geq(n-1)\lambda$, the existence of an area-minimizing hypersurface would imply $M$ is splitting.</description>

Abstract: In this work we describe a class of subsets of the Euclidean plane which, with the induced length metric, are locally $CAT(0)$ spaces and we show that the gluing of two such subsets along a piece of their boundary is again a locally $CAT(0)$ space provided that the sum of the signed curvatures at every gluing point is non-positive. A generalization to subsets of smooth Riemannian surfaces of curvature $k\leq 0$ is given.</description>

      <title>Crossing-Preserving Geodesic Tracking on Spherical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image analysis one often encounters spherical images, for instance in retinal imaging. The behavior of the vessels in the retina is an indicator of several diseases. To automate disease diagnosis using retinal images, it is necessary to develop an algorithm that automatically identifies and tracks vessels. To deal with crossings due to projected blood vessels in the image it is common to lift retinal images to the space of planar positions and orientations $\mathbb{M} := \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This implicitly assumes that the flat image accurately represents the geometry of the retina. As the eyeball is a sphere (and not a plane), we propose to compute the cusp-free, crossing-preserving geodesics in the space of spherical positions and orientations $\mathbb{W}$ on wide-field images. We clarify how to relate both manifolds and compare the calculated geodesics. The results show clear advantages of crossing-preserving tracking in $\mathbb{W}$ over non-crossing-preserving tracking in $\mathbb{W}$ and are comparable to tracking results in $\mathbb{M}$.</description>

Consequently, we obtain that every completely solvable solvmanifold admitting a Vaisman structure has to be a Kodaira-Thurston manifold, and the non-existence of LCK Einstein-Weyl structures on solvmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention for Heterogeneous Graphs with Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for modeling graph data, with attention mechanisms and transformers significantly enhancing their performance on graph-based tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synthetic metric spacetime structure of the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg group and we study the optimal transport problem in this space. The sub-Lorentzian version of Brenier's theorem is established in this setting. Finally, we provide examples of optimal transport maps and derive a sub-Lorentzian Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal K\"ahler space whose canonical sheaf is a rank-one free $\mathcal O_X$ module and whose singularities are isolated, rational and quasi-homogeneous. We prove then that the obstruction to deforming $X$ concentrates upon its singularities, generalizing partially the results of Namikawa--Gross. We prove also that the locally trivial deformations of $X$ are unobstructed.</description>

      <title>A new energy method for shortening and straightening complete curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel energy method that reinterprets ``curve shortening'' as ``tangent aligning''. This conceptual shift enables the variational study of infinite-length curves evolving by the curve shortening flow, as well as higher order flows such as the elastic flow, which involves not only the curve shortening but also the curve straightening effect. For the curve shortening flow, we prove convergence to a straight line under mild assumptions on the ends of the initial curve. For the elastic flow, we establish a foundational global well-posedness theory, and investigate the precise long-time behavior of solutions. In fact, our method applies to a more general class of geometric evolution equations including the surface diffusion flow, Chen's flow, and the free elastic flow.</description>

      <title>On empirical Hodge Laplacians under the manifold hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d. observations uniformly distributed on a closed submanifold of the Euclidean space, we study higher-order generalizations of graph Laplacians, so-called Hodge Laplacians on graphs, as approximations of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on differential forms. Our main result is a high-probability error bound for the associated Dirichlet forms. This bound improves existing Dirichlet form error bounds for graph Laplacians in the context of Laplacian Eigenmaps, and it provides insights into the Betti numbers studied in topological data analysis and the complementing positive part of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the infinitesimal geometry of the limit spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, where we assume lower bounds on the sectional curvatures of manifolds and boundaries and the second fundamental forms of boundaries and an upper diameter bound. We mainly focus on the case when inradii of manifolds are uniformly bounded away from zero. In this case, many limit spaces have wild geometry, which arise as the boundary singular points of the limit spaces. We determine the infinitesimal structure at those boundary singular points. We also determine the Hausdorff dimensions of the boundary singular sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture on several special types of Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09425v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in complex dimension $2$ but is still open in complex dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of compact Hermitian manifolds, including Chern K\"ahler-like manifolds, non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds, and compact quotients of Lie groups whose Lie algebra contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of codimension $2$. The last type is a natural generalization to (compact quotients of) almost abelian Lie groups. The non-balanced BTP case contains all Vaisman manifolds and all Bismut K\"ahler-like manifolds as subsets. These results extend some of the earlier works on the topic by Fino, Kasuya, Vezzoni, Angella, Otiman, Paradiso, and others. Our approach is elementary in nature, by giving explicit descriptions of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on such spaces as well as the pathways of deforming them into K\"ahler ones, aimed at illustrating the algebraic complexity and subtlety of Streets-Tian Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\"ahler Ricci soliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complex projective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. This can be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa. This result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ over the momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-soliton exists. We discuss other ramifications of this approach, including a Licherowicz type obstruction to the existence of a K\"ahler Ricci soliton and a Fujita type volume bound for the existence of a $v$-soliton.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Shock Filtering on the Space of Positions and Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering from Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the space of positions and orientations $\mathbb{M}_2 := \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures, since they become disentangled when lifted to $\mathbb{M}_2$. We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as Total Roto-Translational Variation (TR-TV) flow, NLM, and BM3D when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented. Additionally, we see that $\mathbb{M}_2$ RDS inpainting is indeed able to restore crossing structures, unlike $\mathbb{R}^2$ RDS inpainting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the formal $\hbar$-power series solution of the deformed Painlev\'{e} I equation is resurgent, which means it is generically Borel summable and its Borel transform admits endless analytic continuation. In particular, we find that the Borel transform defines a global multivalued holomorphic function on a singular algebraic surface isomorphic to the Fermat quintic surface $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 0$ modulo an involution. This surface is an algebraic fibration over the complex plane of the differential equation with generic fibre a smooth quintic curve. Each fibre is equipped with a fivefold covering map over another complex plane (the Borel plane) with ten ramification points (the Borel singularities) spread equally over two branch points giving two opposite Stokes rays.</description>

      <title>Complex Hessian measures with respect to a background Hermitian form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop potential theory for $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a Hermitian metric on a Hermitian manifold. First, we show that the complex Hessian operator is well-defined for bounded functions in this class. This allows to define the $m$-capacity and then showing the quasi-continuity of $m$-subharmonic functions. Thanks to this we derive other results parallel to those in pluripotential theory such as the equivalence between polar sets and negligible sets. The theory is then used to study the complex Hessian equation on compact Hermitian manifold with boundary, with the right hand side of the equation admitting a bounded subsolution. This is an extension of a recent result of Collins and Picard dealing with classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problems for Einstein equations in three-dimensional spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>
