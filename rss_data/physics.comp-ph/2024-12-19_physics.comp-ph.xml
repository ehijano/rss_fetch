      <title>Forward and Inverse Simulation of Pseudo-Two-Dimensional Model of Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenges posed by the high nonlinearity of the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation in forward and inverse simulations of the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework. The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \( j \) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \( \psi \) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Resonance modes in microstructured photonic waveguides: Efficient and accurate computation based on AAA rational approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for the efficient and accurate computation of resonance modes in photonic waveguides. The framework is based on AAA rational approximation with the application of special light sources. It allows one to calculate only relevant modes, such as the fundamental resonance modes localized in the central core of the waveguides. We demonstrate the framework using an example from the literature, a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. This waveguide supports many other modes, such as cladding modes and higher-order modes. These nonrelevant modes are not calculated, so that challenging post-processing with mode filtering is not required.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Quantum Measurement Problem through Leveraging the Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation is incomplete, inherently unable to explain the collapse of the wavefunction caused by measurement; a fundamental issue known as the quantum measurement problem. Quantum mechanics is generally constrained by the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite observations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating that in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal equation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation window. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes substantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that only with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in a well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is warped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique solution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions. Our framework bridges seemingly disparate concepts such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, decoherence, and measurement within intrinsic quantum mechanics even without invoking new theory.</description>

      <title>Simulating imperfect quantum optical circuits using unsymmetrized bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing requires the generation of large entangled resource states. The required size of these states makes it challenging to simulate the effects of errors such as loss and partial distinguishability. For an interferometer with $N$ partially distinguishable input photons and $M$ spatial modes, the Fock basis can have up to ${N+NM-1\choose N}$ elements. We show that it is possible to use a much smaller unsymmetrized basis with size $M^N$ without discarding any information. This enables simulations of the joint effect of loss and partial distinguishability on larger states than is otherwise possible. We demonstrate the technique by providing the first-ever simulations of the generation of imperfect qubits encoded using quantum parity codes, including an example where the Hilbert space is over $60$ orders of magnitude smaller than the $N$-photon Fock space. As part of the analysis, we derive the loss mechanism for partially distinguishable photons.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Higher-Order Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is challenging to scale Ising machines for industrial-level problems due to algorithm or hardware limitations. Although higher-order Ising models provide a more compact encoding, they are, however, hard to physically implement. This work proposes a theoretical framework of a higher-order Ising simulator, IsingSim. The Ising spins and gradients in IsingSim are decoupled and self-customizable. We significantly accelerate the simulation speed via a bidirectional approach for differentiating the hyperedge functions. Our proof-of-concept implementation verifies the theoretical framework by simulating the Ising spins with exact and approximate gradients. Experiment results show that our novel framework can be a useful tool for providing design guidelines for higher-order Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of two-dimensional hydrogenated transition-metal diborides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of MgB2 with Tc=39K, various metal diborides of MB2 have been intensively studied to find possible conventional high-temperature superconductors. A possible 2D structure of the metal diboride has been shown to be in the form of M2B2. Using density functional theory, we investigated phase stability and possible conventional superconductors for non-hydrogenation M2B2, light hydrogenation M2B2H, and heavy hydrogenation M2B2H4 of transition metal borides M2B2 (M=Sc,Y,V,Nb). The light hydrogenation M2B2H show as if they were a perturbed system from the non-hydrogenation in which the electronic structure, the phonon property, and the possible superconducting state are slightly changed. However, the heavy hydrogenation of M2B2H4 give very promising 2D materials with a possible high Tc of up to 84K at ambient pressure. This would fill the gaps for the study of possible conventional high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>{\eta}-ensemble path integral Monte Carlo approach to the free energy of the warm dense electron gas and the uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the recently introduced $\eta$-ensemble approach to compute the free energy directly from \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2407.01044] and apply it to the archetypal uniform electron gas model both in the warm dense matter and strongly coupled regimes. Specifically, we present an in-depth study of the relevant algorithmic details such as the choice of the free weighting parameter and the choice of the optimum number of intermediate $\eta$-steps to connect the real, non-ideal system ($\eta=1$) with the ideal limit ($\eta=0$). Moreover, we explore the inherent decomposition of the full free energy into its ideal bosonic, ideal-to-interacting, and bosonic-to-fermionic contributions for different parameter regimes. Finally, we compare our new free energy data with an existing free energy parametrization [Groth \emph{et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)] obtained via adiabatic connection formula evaluations, and we find very good agreement in its range of applicability, i.e., for density parameters $r_s\leq20$; in addition, we present the first PIMC results for the free energy in the low density regime of $20 &lt; r_s\leq 100$. We expect our results to be of interest both for the study of matter under extreme conditions, as well as to the more general field of PIMC simulations of interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Recursive Algorithm to the Centroid of Free Area for Inherent Structure and Hopping Motion in Deeply Supercooled Binary Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inherent structures, derived by eliminating thermal fluctuations from complex trajectories, illuminate fundamental mechanisms underlying structural relaxation and dynamic heterogeneity in dense glassy systems. However, determining these structures in hard disk/sphere systems presents unique challenges due to the discontinuous nature of inter-particle potentials and resultant flat potential energy landscapes. To address this limitation, we introduce the Recursive Centroid of Free Area algorithm (ReCFA), a novel approach inspired by a steepest descent method, which computes inherent structure configurations in hard disk systems. We conducted comparative analyses between ReCFA, similar methods, and a conventional time-coarse-graining technique, focusing on string-like hopping motions in supercompressed binary hard disks that emulate supercooled liquid behavior. ReCFA demonstrated notable advantages in capturing entropic contributions. The configurations derived through ReCFA exhibited physically reasonable particle displacements analogous to inherent structures in soft particle systems, effectively identifying hopping motions between metastable basins in jammed states. This ReCFA-based analysis enhances our understanding of relaxation dynamics in highly compressed glassy systems, offering a robust analytical tool for investigating both dynamic and structural characteristics across hard and soft particle systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm designed to approximate quantum transformation matrix with a restricted number of gates by using the block decomposition technique. Addressing challenges posed by numerous gates in handling large qubit transformations, the algorithm provides a solution by optimizing gate usage while maintaining computational accuracy. Inspired by the Block Decompose algorithm, our approach processes transformation matrices in a block-wise manner, enabling users to specify the desired gate count for flexibility in resource allocation. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in approximating transformations with significantly fewer gates, enhancing quantum computing efficiency for complex calculations. This work contributes a practical tool for efficient quantum computation, bridging the gap for scalable and effective quantum information processing applications.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we utilize new coil objectives for stellarator optimization with autodifferentiation, including pointwise and net coil-coil forces and torques. We use these methods to perform the first large-scale optimization of planar dipole coil arrays, since arrays of small and geometrically simple coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators, generate advantageous magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks, and provide active, real-time control capabilities. We perform an ablation study to show that minimizing the orientation and location of each coil may be essential to get coil forces, coil torques, and field errors to tolerable levels. We conclude by generating planar coil array solutions for three reactor-scale quasi-symmetric stellarators.</description>

      <title>Kinetic view on dynamic plasticity of crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructural changes in solids, driven by energy flows, do not develop in a static continuous space, such as the space considered in conventional plasticity models. The applied forces create an evolving internal energy landscape, which is constrained by crystallography but has characteristic spatial and temporal scales that form dynamically. To describe this view, we replace a common model for the evolution of dislocation substructure in metals with the evolution of microscopic slips in a combinatorial structure referred to as a polytopal cell complex (PCC). The micro-slips are associated with the 2-cells (faces) of the PCC and are driven by the minimisation of a properly defined Lagrangian. The approach provides a comprehensive statistical and thermodynamic description of plastic flow development. It allows the investigation of energy levels associated with different slip systems and reveals the microscopic mechanisms that result in the phenomenon of strain rate sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of experimental results with Python often requires writing many code scripts which all need access to the same set of functions. In a common field of research, this set will be nearly the same for many users. The qspec Python package was developed to provide functions for physical formulas, simulations and data analysis routines widely used in laser spectroscopy and related fields. Most functions are compatible with numpy arrays, enabling fast calculations with large samples of data. A multidimensional linear regression algorithm enables a King plot analyses over multiple atomic transitions. A modular framework for constructing lineshape models can be used to fit large sets of spectroscopy data. A simulation module within the package provides user-friendly methods to simulate the coherent time-evolution of atoms in electro-magnetic fields without the need to explicitly derive a Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: The second PyHEP.dev workshop, part of the "Python in HEP Developers" series organized by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF), took place in Aachen, Germany, from August 26 to 30, 2024. This gathering brought together nearly 30 Python package developers, maintainers, and power users to engage in informal discussions about current trends in Python, with a primary focus on analysis tools and techniques in High Energy Physics (HEP).
  The workshop agenda encompassed a range of topics, such as defining the scope of HEP data analysis, exploring the Analysis Grand Challenge project, evaluating statistical models and serialization methods, assessing workflow management systems, examining histogramming practices, and investigating distributed processing tools like RDataFrame, Coffea, and Dask. Additionally, the workshop dedicated time to brainstorming the organization of future PyHEP.dev events, upholding the tradition of alternating between Europe and the United States as host locations.
  This document, prepared by the session conveners in the weeks following the workshop, serves as a summary of the key discussions, salient points, and conclusions that emerged.</description>
