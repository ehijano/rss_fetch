      <title>Universal Model for Ferroelectric Capacitors Operating Down to Deep Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary oxide ferroelectrics like doped HfO2, compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platforms, have gained significant interest for energy efficient, scalable, high-performance non-volatile memory and neuromorphic technologies. However, there is a gap in models for doped hafnia systems that can explain physical properties while being circuit simulation compatible and computationally efficient. We present a universal model based on the Jiles-Atherton equations to reproduce experimentally measured polarization switching in ferroelectric thin film capacitors under different electric field and temperature conditions. Additionally, device-to-device variation effect on the model parameters is presented, which will enable large-scale integration of the FE components to complex functional circuits. Due to increased interest in cryogenic electronics for quantum computing and space technologies, effect of temperatures on polarization switching is investigated down to 4 K. We show our model can reproduce the experimental polarization-voltage relation of Hafnium Zirconium Oxide (HZO) capacitors with nearly 100 % accuracy, for different electric fields and temperatures down to 4 K, including analog switching. We find cooling the devices below 100 K increases polarization update linearity and symmetry significantly. Our results represent an important advancement towards application of ferroelectric HZO capacitors for large-scale memory and neuromorphic circuits operating down to deep cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Matched Multiple Channel AlScN/GaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlScN is a new wide bandgap, high-k, ferroelectric material for RF, memory, and power applications. Successful integration of high quality AlScN with GaN in epitaxial layer stacks depends strongly on the ability to control lattice parameters and surface or interface through growth. This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of AlScN/GaN multilayer heterostructures. Single layer Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N/GaN heterostructures exhibited lattice-matched composition within $x$ = 0.09 -- 0.11 using substrate (thermocouple) growth temperatures between 330 $ ^\circ$C and 630 $ ^\circ$C. By targeting the lattice-matched Sc composition, pseudomorphic AlScN/GaN multilayer structures with ten and twenty periods were achieved, exhibiting excellent structural and interface properties as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). These multilayer heterostructures exhibited substantial polarization-induced net mobile charge densities of up to 8.24 $\times$ 10$^{14}$/cm$^2$ for twenty channels. The sheet density scales with the number of AlScN/GaN periods. By identifying lattice-matched growth condition and using it to generate multiple conductive channels, this work enhances our understanding of the AlScN/GaN material platform.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Electronic Transitions to Ferroelectric Order in a 2D Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ferroelectric material often exhibits a soft transvers optical (TO) phonon mode which governs it phase transition. Charge coupling to this ferroelectric soft mode may further mediate emergent physical properties, including superconductivity and defect tolerance. However, direct experimental evidence for such coupling is scarce. Here we show that a photo-launched coherent phonon couples strongly to electronic transitions across the bandgap in the van der Waals (vdW) two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we identify this mode as the TO phonon responsible for ferroelectric order. This exclusive coupling occurs only with above-gap electronic transition and is absent in the valence band as revealed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. Our findings suggest a new role of the soft TO phonon mode in electronic and optical properties of ferroelectric semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Effects of localized laser-induced heating in the photoluminescence of silicon-vacancy color centers in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) color centers in 4H-SiC are optically accessible through their zero-phonon line (ZPL) photoluminescence (PL), which is sensitive to the sample temperature. We report the effects of localized laser-induced heating in 4H-SiC by measuring the PL spectra of $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ color centers. The effects of laser-induced heating manifest as the decrease in the peak height, redshift, and broadening of the ZPLs in the PL spectrum. The local temperature in the sample can be determined from the center energy of the ZPLs by using the Varshni equation. The sample temperature can be modeled as a system in contact with a thermal reservoir while being heated by a laser beam. This work highlights the importance of considering laser-induced heating in the optical properties of color centers in 4H-SiC and their potential applications. The result also suggests that the sharp and bright ZPLs of color centers can be used as local temperature probes in 4H-SiC devices.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires for pulsed magnets investigated by ultrasonic techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Ti2N Formation by N Atom Intercalation in Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Ti2N and Ti belong to different crystal systems and Bravais lattices, we show that N intercalation in Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) Ti can lead to the formation of Ti2N by diffusionless displacement of Ti atoms, which is a nucleation-free growth process. This is due to the structural similarity of Ti atoms in Ti and Ti2N. For N intercalation in Ti, the first N2 molecule should adsorb on the surface of Ti {0001} and dissociate into N atoms, and then enough of the adsorbed N atoms should diffuse into Ti to form Ti2N. We calculated the enthalpy of formation for each step during N intercalation using density functional theory (DFT). We found that N intercalation was thermodynamically favored at each step of nitridation till the formation of Ti2N. We identified the transition network for each diffusion path and calculated the diffusion coefficient of N from surface to sub-surface to bulk.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Constraint for the Electronic Structure of Fe-Ni Alloys at Room And High-Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the electronic structure of metal alloys is hampered by the in-applicability of conventional quantum oscillation measurements to high-temperatures and alloy scattering. Recent advancements in the study of the electronic contribution to the entropy suggest a path to ground transport properties in alloy equilibrium thermodynamics. Fe-Ni represents an interesting test-case because it exhibits an intricate electronic structure, order-disorder transformations, and a large solid-solution region where equilibrium data can be obtained. Using cluster modeling, the electronic contribution to the entropy can be inferred from high-temperature thermodynamic data. Electronic transport property measurements can be used to independently evaluate the electronic contribution to the entropy. Reconciling these two approaches at high temperature confirms a new path to study electronic structure for metal alloys.</description>

      <title>PyLRO: A Python Calculator for Analyzing Long Range Structural Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PyLRO, an open-source Python calculator designed to detect, quantify, and display long-range order in periodic structures. The program's design methodology, workflow, and approach to order quantification are described and demonstrated using a simple toy model. Additionally, we apply PyLRO to a series of metastable AlPO4 structural intermediates from a prior high-pressure study, demonstrating how to compute and visualize structural order in all directions on a Miller sphere. We further highlight the program's capabilities through a high-throughput analysis of structural patterns in the pressure-induced amorphization of AlPO4, revealing atomistic insights within specific energy regions of massive amorphous structures. These results suggest that PyLRO can be a valuable tool for investigating crystal-amorphous transition in materials research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal and straightforward algebraic procedure for flat bands construction, polynomial indicator method. Using only Bloch Hamiltonian eigendeterminant functional to identify conditions that guarantee existence of nondispersive eigenvalues, the polynomial indicator method is applicable to all lattice types, enabling predictions of (topological) flat bands in electronic band structure (across the materials), as well as all possible designs of novel artificial flat band lattices. The method is in detail illustrated on several examples - kagome and dice lattice included.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of the Recently Synthesized Nitrogen-Doped Monolayer Amorphous Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of nitrogen-doped monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC @N) opens new possibilities for multifunctional materials. In this study, we have investigated the nitrogen doping limits and their effects on MAC@N's structural and electronic properties using density functional-based tight-binding simulations. Our results show that MAC@N remains stable up to 35\% nitrogen doping, beyond which the lattice becomes unstable. The formation energies of MAC@N are higher than those of nitrogen-doped graphene for all the cases we have investigated. Both undoped MAC and MAC@N exhibit metallic behavior, although only MAC features a Dirac-like cone. MAC has an estimated Young's modulus value of about 410 GPa, while MAC@N's modulus can vary around 416 GPa depending on nitrogen content. MAC displays optical activity in the ultraviolet range, whereas MAC@N features light absorption within the infrared and visible ranges, suggesting potential for distinct optoelectronic applications. Their structural thermal stabilities were addressed through molecular dynamics simulations. MAC melts at approximately 4900K, while MAC@N loses its structural integrity for temperatures ranging from 300K to 3300K, lower than graphene. These results point to potential MAC@N applications in flexible electronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Geometry Revealed by NMR Lineshape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for extracting microstructural geometry from NMR lineshape analysis in porous materials at angstrom-scale resolution with the use of weak magnetic field gradients. Diverging from the generally held view of FID signals undergoing simple exponential decay, we show that a detailed analysis of the line shape can unravel structural geometry on much smaller scales than previously thought. While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR lineshapes, using the Green-Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means towards structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries. This method is expected to find applications in materials science, catalysis, biomedicine and other areas.</description>

      <title>Experimental detection of topological electronic state and large linear magnetoresistance in $SrSn_{4}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent experiments confirm the existence of hundreds of topological electronic materials, only a few exhibit the coexistence of superconductivity and a topological electronic state. These compounds attract significant attention in forefront research because of the potential for the existence of topological superconductivity, paving the way for future technological advancements. $SrSn_{4}$ is known for exhibiting unusual superconductivity below the transition temperature ($T_{C}$) of 4.8 K. Recent theory predicts a topological electronic state in this compound, which is yet to be confirmed by experiments. Systematic and detailed studies of the magnetotransport properties of $SrSn_{4}$ and its Fermi surface characterizations are also absent. For the first time, a quantum oscillation study reveals a nontrivial $\pi$ Berry phase, very light effective mass, and high quantum mobility of charge carriers in $SrSn_{4}$. Magnetotransport experiment unveils large linear transverse magnetoresistance (TMR) of more than 1200% at 5 K and 14 T. Angle-dependent transport experiments detect anisotropic and four-fold symmetric TMR, with the maximum value ($\sim$ 2000%) occurring when the angle between the magnetic field and the crystallographic b-axis is 45 degree. Our results suggest that $SrSn_{4}$ is the first topological material with superconductivity above the boiling point of helium that displays such high magnetoresistance.</description>

      <title>Modeling glasses from first-principles using random structure sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to modeling static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO$_2$ as an example, we show how various properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce well the experimental results including mass density, different reciprocal space and real space structure functions as well as the electronic density of states and the bulk modulus. The practical benefit of our approach is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses closer to the state of modeling of crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Trapped Nanocrystals with Symmetry-Preserving Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of nanocrystals is crucial in determining their surface area, reactivity, optical properties, mechanical strength, and self-assembly behavior. Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.</description>

      <title>Revealing Fano Resonance in Dirac Materials ZrTe5 through Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Fano resonance in ZrTe5, using Raman scattering measurements. We identified two closely spaced B2g phonon modes, B2g I and B2g II, around 9 meV and 10 meV, respectively. Interestingly, only B2g I exhibited the Fano resonance, an outcome of quantum interference between discrete phonon modes and continuous electronic excitations. This is consistent with the much stronger electron-phonon coupling of B2g I mode demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Additionally, temperature-dependent measurements highlight an enhanced Fano asymmetry at elevated temperatures, originating from the thermal effect on the joint electron-hole density of states. This study offers insights into the complex interrelation of electron-phonon coupling, thermal effect, and Fano resonances in ZrTe5.</description>

      <title>Large Chiral Orbital Texture and Orbital Edelstein Effect in Co/Al Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments by S. Krishnia et al., Nano Lett. 23, 6785 (2023) reported an unprecedentedly large enhancement of torques upon inserting thin Al layer in Co/Pt heterostructure that suggested the presence of a Rashba-like interaction at the metallic Co/Al interface. Based on first-principles calculations, we reveal the emergence of a large helical orbital texture in reciprocal space at the interfacial Co layer, whose origin is attributed to the orbital Rashba effect due to the formation of the surface states at the Co/Al interface and where spin-orbit coupling is found to produce smaller contributions with a higher-order winding of the orbital momentum. Our results unveil that the orbital texture gives rise to a non-equilibrium orbital accumulation producing large current-induced torques, thus providing an essential theoretical background for the experimental data and advancing the use of orbital transport phenomena in all-metallic magnetic systems with light elements.</description>

      <title>Reversible long-range domain wall motion in an improper ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reversible ferroelectric domain wall movements beyond the 10 nm range associated with Rayleigh behavior are usually restricted to specific defect-engineered systems. Here, we demonstrate that such long-range movements naturally occur in the improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 during electric-field-cycling. We study the electric-field-driven motion of domain walls, showing that they readily return to their initial position after having travelled distances exceeding 250 nm. By applying switching spectroscopy band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy, we track the domain wall movement with nanometric spatial precision and analyze the local switching behavior. Phase field simulations show that the reversible long-range motion is intrinsic to the hexagonal manganites, linking it to their improper ferroelectricity and topologically protected structural vortex lines, which serve as anchor point for the ferroelectric domain walls. Our results give new insight into the local dynamics of domain walls in improper ferroelectrics and demonstrate the possibility to reversibly displace domain walls over much larger distances than commonly expected for ferroelectric systems in their pristine state, ensuring predictable device behavior for applications such as tunable capacitors or sensors</description>

      <title>AFM-based Functional Tomography-To Mill or not to Mill, that is the Question!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical response of ferroelectric domain walls is often influenced by their geometry underneath the sample surface. Tomographic imaging in these material systems has therefore become increasingly important for its ability to correlate the surface-level functional response with subsurface domain microstructure. In this context, AFM-based tomography emerges as a compelling choice because of its simplicity, high resolution and robust contrast mechanism. However, to date, the technique has been implemented in a limited number of ferroelectric materials, typically to depths of a few hundred nanometers or on relatively soft materials, resulting in an unclear understanding of its capabilities and limitations. In this work, AFM tomography is carried out in YbMnO3, mapping its complex domain microstructure up to a depth of around 1.8 um along with its current pathways. A model is presented, describing the impact of interconnected domain walls within the network, which act as current dividers and codetermine how currents distribute. Finally, challenges such as tip-blunting and subsurface amorphisation are identified through TEM studies, and strategies to address them are also put forward. This study highlights the potential of AFM tomography and could spur interest within the ferroics community for its use in the investigation of similar material systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Structures and Strength-Toughness of Silica and Quartz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular structures of amorphous silica and crystalline quartz are used to predict their intrinsic strength and fracture toughness together with the theoretical strength of silicon dioxide. At the atomic scale, the amorphous silica is characterised by the silicon dioxide molecules or crystals around 0.31 nm in diameter. Thus, both silica and quartz can be modelled as crystalline materials. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by experiments data in literature.</description>

      <title>Tensor-involved peridynamics: A unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>Negative piezoelectricity in quasi-two/one-dimensional ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of low-dimensional ferroelectrics has attracted great attention for their promising applications in nano devices. Piezoelectricity is one of the most core properties of ferroelectric materials, which plays the essential role in micro-electromechanical systems. Very recently, the anomalous negative piezoelectricity has been predicted/discovered in many quasi-two-dimensional layered ferroelectric materials. In this Topical Review, we will briefly introduce on the negative piezoelectricity in quasi-two/one-dimensional ferroelectrics, including its fundamental concept, typical materials, theoretical predictions, as well as experimental phenomena. The underlying physical mechanisms for negative piezoelectricity are divergent and varying from case by case, which can be categorized into four types. First, the soft van der Waals layer is responsible for the volume shrinking upon pressure while the electric dipoles is from non van der Waals layer. Second, the noncollinearity of local dipoles creates a ferrielectricity, which leads to orthogonal ferroelectric and antiferroelectric axes. Third, the electric dipoles come from interlayer/interchain couplings, which can be enhanced during the volume shrinking. Fourth, the special buckling structure contributes to local dipoles, which can be enhanced upon pressure. In real materials, more than one mechanism may work together. Finally, the future directions of negative piezoelectricity and their potential applications are outlooked.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Spin Seebeck effect induced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Vibrational States of Double-Well Potentials in the Solid State from DFT Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general approach for the simulation of quantum vibrational states of (symmetric and asymmetric) double-well potentials in molecules and materials for thermodynamic and spectroscopic applications. The method involves solving the nuclear Schr\"odinger equation associated with a one-mode potential of the type $V (Q) = aQ^2 + bQ^3 + cQ^4$ (with $a &lt; 0$ and $c &gt; 0$), and thus explicitly includes nuclear quantum effects. The potential, $V (Q)$, is obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at displaced nuclear configurations along the selected normal mode, $Q$. The strategy has been implemented into the CRYSTAL electronic structure package and allows for i) the use of many density functional approximations, including hybrid ones, and ii) integration with a quasi-harmonic module. The method is applied to the spectroscopic characterization of soft lattice modes in two phases of the molecular crystal of thiourea: a low-temperature ferroelectric phase and a high-temperature paraelectric phase. Signature peaks associated to structural changes between the two phases are found in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which exhibit strong anharmonic character in their thermal evolution, as measured by temperature-dependent terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Artical Functionalization of structural and electronic properties of multiferroic SrTiO3 thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the application of transition metal-doped SrTiO3 in photovoltaic technologies, such as photocatalysis. The core objective is to evaluate how different dopants influence the structural and electronic characteristics of the well-known perovskite, SrTiO3 (STO). By incorporating dopants, particularly transition metals, the material's physical properties can be enhanced by addressing limitations such as the large gap in the valence band. This study aims to determine the impact of these metals on factors like crystallite size, internal stress levels, electron-hole pair distribution in the valence band, and the shift in the electromagnetic spectrum toward the visible range. The primary focus is on assessing nickel's (Ni) influence on these properties, with additional investigation into the effects of yttrium (Y) and iron (Fe). Several experimental methods were employed to analyze the structural and electronic properties of SrTiO3. The same procedures were applied consistently across all samples, with the sole exception being the high-temperature XRD experiments, as described in the text. The techniques used include magnetron pulse deposition for sample preparation, followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After conducting the experiments, the collected data were evaluated and used to guide subsequent steps. Finally, all data were consolidated and analyzed comprehensively.</description>

      <title>Sulfur Vacancies Limit the Open-circuit Voltage of Sb2S3 Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising candidate as an absorber layer for single-junction solar cells and the top subcell in tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency of Sb2S3-based solar cells has remained stagnant over the past decade, largely due to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Here we assess the trap-limited conversion efficiency of Sb2S3 by investigating non-radiative carrier capture rates for intrinsic point defects using first-principles calculations and Sah-Shockley statistics. Our results show that sulfur vacancies act as effective recombination centers, limiting the maximum efficiency of Sb2S3 to 16% light to electricity. The equilibrium concentrations of sulfur vacancies remain relatively high regardless of growth conditions, indicating the intrinsic limitations imposed by these vacancies on the performance of Sb2S3.</description>

      <title>Tracking solid oxide cell electrode microstructural evolution during annealing by scanning 3D X-ray diffraction microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ni particle coarsening is a primary degradation mechanism in Ni/YSZ solid oxide cells, limiting the lifespan of these devices. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Scanning 3D X-ray diffraction (S3DXRD) with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 100 nm, to monitor the microstructural evolution within the 3D volume of a solid oxide cell subjected to ex situ heat treatment. Unlike conventional tomography, S3DXRD combines crystallographic information with spatial maps, enabling precise identification of grain boundaries and the determination of local curvature changes in the Ni microstructure. Our study reveals that the Ni phase undergoes significant structural changes during annealing, driven by grain growth. This transformation is characterized by a reduction in local curvature, particularly in regions where grains disappear. We observe that the disappearing grains are the smallest grains in the size distribution and are often located near pores. As a result, the most notable reduction in local curvature occurs at the Ni-pore interface. The quantitative characterization of polycrystalline microstructural evolution in Ni/YSZ system provides new insights into the mechanisms of Ni particle coarsening in SOC devices, potentially guiding strategies to enhance the long-term stability of SOC devices.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of phonon angular momentum through hybridization with magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, the breaking of improper rotational symmetry, is a fundamental concept spanning diverse scientific domains. In condensed matter physics, chiral phonons, originating from circular atomic motions that carry angular momentum, have sparked intense interest due to their coupling to magnetic degrees of freedom, enabling potential phonon-controlled spintronics. However, modes and their counter-rotating counterparts are typically degenerate at the Brillouin zone center. Selective excitation of a single-handed circulating phonon requires external stimuli that break the degeneracy. Whether energetically nondegenerate circularly polarized phonons can appear spontaneously without structural or external symmetry breaking remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate that nondegenerate elliptically polarized phonon pairs can be induced by coupling to magnons with same helicity in the van der Waals antiferromagnet $\mathrm{FePSe_3}$. We confirm the presence of magnon-phonon hybrids, also known as magnon polarons, which exhibit inherent elliptical polarization with opposite helicities and distinct energies. This nondegeneracy enables their coherent excitation with linearly polarized terahertz pulses, which also endows these rotating modes with chirality. By tuning the polarization of the terahertz drive and measuring phase-resolved polarimetry of the resulting coherent oscillations, we determine the ellipticity and map the trajectory of these hybrid quasiparticles. Our findings establish a general approach to search for intrinsically nondegenerate phonons with angular momentum at the center of the Brillouin zone and introduce a new methodology for characterizing their ellipticity, outlining a roadmap towards chiral-phonon-controlled spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Fracture Characterization of Bioinspired Irregular Network Reinforced Composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical behavior of composite materials is significantly influenced by their structure and constituent materials. One emerging class of composite materials is irregular network reinforced composites (NRC's), whose reinforcing phase is generated by a stochastic algorithm. Although design of the reinforcing phase network offers tailorable control over both the global mechanical properties, like stiffness and strength, and the local properties, like fracture nucleation and propagation, the fracture properties of irregular NRC's has not yet been fully characterized. This is because both the irregular reinforcing structure and choice of matrix phase material significantly affect the fracture response, often resulting in diffuse damage, associated with multiple crack nucleation locations. Here, we propose irregular polymer NRC's whose matrix phase has a similar stiffness but half the strength of the reinforcing phase, which allows the structure of the reinforcing phase to control the fracture response, while still forming and maintaining a primary crack. Across a range of network coordination numbers, we obtain J-integral and R-curve measurements, and we determine that low coordination polymer NRC's primarily dissipate fracture energy through plastic zone formation, while high coordination polymer NRC's primarily dissipate energy through crack extension. Finally, we determine that there are two critical length scales to characterize and tailor the fracture response of the composites across the coordination numbers: (i) the size of the plastic zone, and (ii) the size and geometry of the structural features, defined as the areas enclosed by the reinforcing network.</description>

Ordered rock salt compounds Na$_2$PrO$_3$ crystallize in two polymorphs ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) comprising honeycomb and hyperhoneycomb lattices of octahedrally coordinated Pr$^{4+}$ (4$f^1$). Although possible realization of antiferromagnetic Kitaev interactions is anticipated for these phases on the basis of ab initio models, the air-sensitivity of the two polymorphs has hampered reliable crystal growth and physical property measurements. Here, we have succeeded in preparing powder and single crystals of both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Na$_2$PrO$_3$ using modified synthetic procedures. Revised crystal structures for both polymorphs are obtained from refinement of untwinned single-crystal X-ray diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Simulation of 24,000 Electrons Dynamics: Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) with the Real-Space Multigrids (RMG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the theory, implementation, and benchmarking of a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) module within the RMG code, designed to simulate the electronic response of molecular systems to external perturbations. Our method offers insights into non-equilibrium dynamics and excited states across a diverse range of systems, from small organic molecules to large metallic nanoparticles. Benchmarking results demonstrate excellent agreement with established TDDFT implementations and showcase the superior stability of our time-integration algorithm, enabling long-term simulations with minimal energy drift. The scalability and efficiency of RMG on massively parallel architectures allow for simulations of complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles with thousands of atoms. Future extensions, including nuclear and spin dynamics, will broaden the applicability of this RT-TDDFT implementation, providing a powerful toolset for studies of photoactive materials, nanoscale devices, and other systems where real-time electronic dynamics is essential.</description>

      <title>Expression with self-consistent magnetic units for calculation of critical current density using the Bean's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss issues related to calculation of critical current density, Jc,mag, reported by Goyal et al [1] using the Bean's model [2,3] via the expression developed by Gyorgy et al. [4] for calculating Jc,mag. When used with the correct formalism with respect to magnetic units, this expression yields to errors in the reported values of Jc,mag, in A/cm2. The authors emphasize the need for self-consistent magnetic unit applications when employing the formula from Gyorgy et al., proposing an expression that eliminates ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis. This note emphasizes the importance of using appropriate magnetic units and urges researchers to reconsider the established methodologies in the literature, fostering improved accuracy in future studies of (RE)BCO-based coated conductors.</description>

      <title>Role of Wettability, Adhesion, and Instabilities in Transitions During Lubricated Sliding Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lubricated contacts in soft materials are important in various engineering systems and natural settings. Three major lubrication regimes are boundary (BL), mixed (ML), and elasto-hydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication, where the contact region is dry, partially wetted, or fully wetted, respectively. The transition between these regimes is insufficiently understood, especially for soft contacts, which impedes desired control of lubricated sliding friction. Here, we report on the role of solid wettability and adhesion on these transitions. Wettability of glycerol on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and adhesion between a glass indenter and PDMS, were varied by exposure of the PDMS to an ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-Ozone) cleaner. By combining friction tests and visualization, we demonstrate that the transition from ML to BL regime is dominated by the wettability of the lubricant; increasing wettability of glycerol makes removal of liquid from the contact region more difficult. Transition from EHL to ML is related to a series of events with increasing normal load, which are thinning of the lubricant layer, sudden jump to contact between the glass indenter and solid substrate across a gap of tens to a few hundreds of nanometers, and attendant elastic instabilities such as wrinkling and stick-slip. These results provide a deeper understanding of transitions in lubricated frictional behavior of soft materials which govern the maximum and minimum friction achievable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates electron energy loss spectroscopy of 2D materials in a 1-30 keV electron microscope, observing 100-times stronger electron-matter coupling relative to 125 keV microscopes. We observe that the universal curve relating beam energy to scattering holds for the transition from bulk graphite to graphene, albeit with a scale factor. We calculate that optimal coupling for most 2D materials and optical nanostructures falls in this range, concluding that spectroscopy of such systems will greatly benefit from use of this previously unexplored energy regime.</description>

      <title>Measurable geometric indicators of local plasticity in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of defects in crystalline phases of matter has been extremely powerful for understanding crystal growth, deformation and melting. These discontinuities in the periodic order of crystals are mathematically described by the Burgers vector, derived from the particle displacements, which encapsulates the direction and magnitude of slip relative to the undeformed state. Since the reference structure of the crystal is known a priori, the Burgers vector can be determined experimentally using both imaging and diffraction methods to measure the lattice distortion, and thus infer the particle displacements. Glasses have structures that lack the periodicity of crystals, and thus a well-defined reference state. Yet, measurable structural parameters can still be obtained from diffraction from a glass. Here we examine the usefulness of these parameters to probe deformation in glasses. We find that coordinated transformations in the centrosymmetry of local particle arrangements are a strong marker of plastic events. Moreover, we investigate two geometric indicators that can be derived from distortions in local diffraction patterns, namely the continuous Burgers vector and the quadrupolar strain. We find that the Burgers vector again emerges as a robust and sensitive metric for understanding local structural transformations due to mechanical deformation, even in structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Impurities and polarons in bosonic quantum gases: a review on recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review describes the field of Bose polarons, arising when mobile impurities are immersed into a bosonic quantum gas. The latter can be realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental observations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we survey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic roots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize state-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron models, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian that applies at weak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used for solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections are devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose polarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra obtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body and Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to studies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in low-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation; and to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed discussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic impurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and extensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or strong interactions relevant for correlated electrons. Finally, an outlook is presented, highlighting possible future research directions and open questions in the field as a whole.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent pressure-dependent on-site Coulomb correction for zero-temperature equations of state of $f$-electron metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $f$-electron materials have many unique properties under pressure, thus of great interest in high-pressure physics and related industrial fields. However, the $f$-electrons pose a substantial challenge to simulations since the electron correlation effects. In this work, we present a first-principles calculation scheme for the equations of state (EoS) of $f$-electron materials. The self-consistent pressure-dependent on-site Coulomb correction is performed based on our recently developed doubly screened Coulomb correction approach. We investigate the zero-temperature EoS over a wide range of pressures and the phase stabilities of four prototypical lanthanide and actinide metals, Pr, Eu, Th and U. The simulated compressive properties are in better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by conventional density functional theory (DFT) and fixed-parameter DFT+$U$ approaches. The pressure-induced phase transitions can also be well described.</description>

      <title>Optical Orientation of Mn$^{2+}$ Spins in Bulk (Zn, Mn)Se Induced by Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical orientation of Mn$^{2+}$ spins in the first excited state $^4$T$_1$ was experimentally observed in bulk (Zn, Mn)Se ($x_\mathrm{Mn}=0.01$) in the an external magnetic field of up to $6\,$T in Faraday geometry. This occurred during quasi-resonant continuous wave circularly polarized photoexcitation of the intracenter d-d transitions. A non-monotonic dependence of the thermal circular polarization of the intracenter photoluminescence on the magnetic field was observed. A theoretical model is proposed to describe the selection rules for resonant optical d-d transitions of an isolated Mn$^{2+}$ ion in a ZnSe cubic crystal. These rules are based on the analysis of the total angular momentum symmetry for the ground ($^6$A$_1$) and first excited ($^4$T$_1$) states of the Mn$^{2+}$ ion. This discussion neglects the specific mechanism for spin-flip processes in a d-shell of the ion during optical excitation. The analysis is founded on the rotational symmetry of the effective total angular momenta and parity for each state as a whole. Additionally, the Jahn-Teller coupling of the excited state orbital parts with tetragonal ($e$-type) local distortions of the crystal lattice is considered. This coupling results in the segregation of cubic axes and spin projections on these axes due to weak spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling in the excited state. This leads to energy splitting for spin states with their projections of $\pm 1/2$ and $\pm 3/2$ on each axis distinguished by specific Jahn-Teller distortion in the corresponding atomic potential minimum. By introducing two different times of relaxation to reach thermodynamic equilibrium for $\pm 1/2$ and $\pm 3/2$ states in each Jahn-Teller configuration, an angle dependent optical orientation contribution in photoluminescence polarization arises in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>An Optical Method for Evaluating the Mechanical Properties of Wires Under Impact Tensile Load</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of materials utilized in architecture or engineering applications can significantly affect their performance under dynamic or impact loading conditions. To evaluate such behavior, force transducers are commonly employed in testing. However, the calibration of force transducers is typically limited to static conditions and relies solely on gravitational forces exerted on standard masses. Thus, assessing the uncertainty in force measurements using force transducers during dynamic loading conditions remains a challenging task, presenting a significant obstacle in accurately characterizing the dynamic behavior of materials. In this work, an optical technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of wires subjected to impact tensile loads is presented. The wire under test is subjected to an impact tensile load by applying the inertial force of a rigid mass, which is supported by utilizing an aerostatic linear bearing with sufficiently small friction. The inertial force applied to the wire can be determined by multiplying the mass of the rigid mass by its acceleration, where the acceleration can be measured employing a Michelson type optical interferometer. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of a tungsten wire under impact tensile loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Many-body Expansion Based Machine Learning Models for Octahedral Transition Metal Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based machine learning models for materials properties show great potential to accelerate virtual high-throughput screening of large chemical spaces. However, in their simplest forms, graph-based models do not include any 3D information and are unable to distinguish stereoisomers such as those arising from different orderings of ligands around a metal center in coordination complexes. In this work we present a modification to revised autocorrelation descriptors, our molecular graph featurization method for machine learning various spin state dependent properties of octahedral transition metal complexes (TMCs). Inspired by analytical semi-empirical models for TMCs, the new modeling strategy is based on the many-body expansion (MBE) and allows one to tune the captured stereoisomer information by changing the truncation order of the MBE. We present the necessary modifications to include this approach in two commonly used machine learning methods, kernel ridge regression and feed-forward neural networks. On a test set composed of all possible isomers of binary transition metal complexes, the best MBE models achieve mean absolute errors of 2.75 kcal/mol on spin-splitting energies and 0.26 eV on frontier orbital energy gaps, a 30-40% reduction in error compared to models based on our previous approach. We also observe improved generalization to previously unseen ligands where the best-performing models exhibit mean absolute errors of 4.00 kcal/mol (i.e., a 0.73 kcal/mol reduction) on the spin-splitting energies and 0.53 eV (i.e., a 0.10 eV reduction) on the frontier orbital energy gaps. Because the new approach incorporates insights from electronic structure theory, such as ligand additivity relationships, these models exhibit systematic generalization from homoleptic to heteroleptic complexes, allowing for efficient screening of TMC search spaces.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Mediated Nonlinear Optical Responses and Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the complexities of nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, particularly the intricate many-body interactions among photons, electrons, and phonons, remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a diagrammatic approach to explore NLO responses with electron-phonon coupling (EPC), focusing on the phonon-mediated nonlinear optical (Ph-NLO) responses up to the second order in photon perturbation. We systematically analyze the shift and ballistic mechanisms responsible for phonon-mediated electron-photon interactions. By incorporating EPC effects, we elucidate phenomena such as phonon-mediated shift current (Ph-SC) and second-harmonic generation (Ph-SHG) in a comprehensive Ph-NLO framework. This approach enables below-gap resonant responses at terahertz photon frequencies, offering a promising mechanism for terahertz optical applications that surpasses the constraints of conventional pure-electronic NLO theories. Additionally, we explore the geometric and topological consequences of Ph-NLO responses by introducing the EPC Berry curvature, EPC quantum metric, and EPC shift vector. These concepts unveil a unique quantum geometric structure within the Hilbert space, parameterized by both the electronic wavevector and phonon-displacement, thereby extending the established pure-electronic quantum geometry. Using a general Rice-Mele model, we demonstrate the connection between Ph-NLO responses and EPC geometry, discussing the implications and predicting observable effects for future experimental validation. This framework also provides a foundation for advancing first-principles calculations aimed at the discovery and engineering of NLO materials. The insights gained from this study contribute to a more profound understanding of NLO responses and EPC quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Super-Bandgap Electroluminescence from Cesium Lead Bromide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites is a new class of semiconductors with exceptional optoelectronic properties. Among many advantages offered by halide perovskites, the bandgap energy can be tuned in a much broader range than what was possible in conventional semiconductors. This was commonly achieved in previous research by mixing different species of halides into solid solutions. The tuned bandgap using this method, however, often underwent an energy shift under optical or electrical stimuli due to halide segregation. In this work, we discovered an alternative approach to achieve super-bandgap electroluminescence from CsPbBr3. The peak energy of the light emission can be 0.7 eV higher than the reported bandgap energy. Evidence pointed to the radiative recombination at the perovskite-PEDOT:PSS interface being responsible for the unexpected blueshift of electroluminescence. We speculated that perovskite nanocrystals were formed therein and produced higher-energy photons due to quantum confinement. The results suggested an alternative strategy to manipulate and stabilize the color of electroluminescence and achieve particularly blue emission in perovskite-based LEDs.</description>

      <title>Collecting single photons from a cavity-coupled quantum dot using an adiabatic tapered fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient in-plane optical fiber collection of single photon emission from quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal cavities. This was achieved via adiabatic coupling between a tapered optical fiber and a tapered on-chip photonic waveguide coupled to the photonic crystal cavity. The collection efficiency of a dot in a photonic crystal cavity was measured to be 5 times greater via the tapered optical fiber compared to collection by a microscope objective lens above the cavity. The single photon source was also characterized by second order photon correlations measurements giving g(2)(0)=0.17 under non-resonant excitation. Numerical calculations demonstrate that the collection efficiency could be further increased by improving the dot-cavity coupling and by increasing the overlap length of the tapered fiber with the on-chip waveguide. An adiabatic coupling of near unity is predicted for an overlap length of 5 microns.</description>

      <title>Residual resistance ratio of Cu stabilizer in commercial REBCO tapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual resistance ratio (RRR) of Cu stabilizer in REBCO coated conductor is an important design parameter for REBCO magnets. In this work, we measured RRR of electroplated Cu stabilizer in commercial REBCO tapes. Over 130 samples were measured for the quality assurance programs of REBCO magnet projects at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL). The average RRR value was above 50. In order to investigate the factors that influence RRR, several samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. We found that, in our samples, RRR was strongly correlated with the grain size. We demonstrated that RRR was primarily determined by grain boundary resistivity. Lower RRR was also strongly correlated with higher concentration of chlorine impurity. This is explained by that higher chlorine impurity hindered the grain growth in the room temperature self annealing process resulting smaller grain. Smaller grain resulted in lower RRR. In addition, thermal annealing significantly enhanced RRR. An activation energy of 0.4 eV was obtained from the annealing experiment which corresponds to the activation of Cu grain growth.</description>

      <title>Biaxial Gaussian Beams, Hermite-Gaussian Beams, and Laguerre-Gaussian Vortex Beams in Isotropy-Broken Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the paraxial approximation for electromagnetic fields in arbitrary isotropy-broken media in terms of the ray-wave tilt and the curvature of materials Fresnel wave surfaces. We obtain solutions of the paraxial equation in the form of biaxial Gaussian beams, which is a novel class of electromagnetic field distributions in generic isotropy-broken materials. Such beams have been previously observed experimentally and numerically in hyperbolic metamaterials but evaded theoretical analysis in the literature up to now. The biaxial Gaussian beams have two axes: one in the direction of Abraham momentum, corresponding to the ray propagation, and another in the direction of Minkowski momentum, corresponding to the wave propagation, in agreement with the recent theory of refraction, ray-wave tilt, and hidden momentum [Durach, 2024, Ref. 1]. We show that the curvature of the wavefronts in the biaxial Gaussian beams correspond to the curvature of the Fresnel wave surface at the central wave vector of the beam. We obtain the higher-order modes of the biaxial beams, including the biaxial Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams, which opens avenues toward studies of optical angular momentum (OAM) in isotropy-broken media, including generic anisotropic and bianisotropic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-trivial magnetic and electronic phases occurring in topological magnets are often entangled, thus leading to a variety of exotic physical properties. Recently, the BaAl$_4$-type compounds have been extensively investigated to elucidate the topological features appearing in their real- and momentum spaces. In particular, the topological Hall effect and the spin textures, typical of the centrosymmetric Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ family, have stimulated extensive experimental and theoretical research. In this topical review, we discuss the latest findings regarding the Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ topological antiferromagnets and related materials, arising from a vast array of experimental techniques. We show that Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ represents a suitable platform to explore the interplay between lattice-, charge-, and spin degrees of freedom, and associated emergent phenomena. Finally, we address some key questions open to future investigation.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Scissor-mediated Electrochemical Exfoliation of Halogenated MXenes and its Boosting in Wear-Resisting Tribovoltaic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes), especially their few-layered nanosheets, have triggered burgeoning research attentions owing to their superiorities including extraordinary conductivity, accessible active surface, and adjustable processability. Molten salts etching route further achieves their controllable surface chemistry. However, the method encounters challenges in achieving few-layer structures due to more complex delamination behaviors. Herein, we present an efficient strategy to fabricate Cl- or Br-terminated MXene nanoflakes with few-layers, achieved by electrochemical intercalation of Li ions and concomitant solvent molecules in the electrolyte solution, with gaseous scissors (propylene molecules) to break up interlayer forces. By controlling cut-off voltages, the optimal protocol results in nanosheets with an ultrahigh yield (~93%) and preserved surface chemistry. The resultant MXenes dispersions were employed as lubricants to enhance tribovoltaic nanogenerators, where Ti3C2Br2 displayed superior electrical output. These findings facilitate the understanding of MXenes' intrinsic physical properties and enable the nanoengineering of advanced electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Intercalation of Functional Materials with Phase Transitions for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing foreign ions, atoms, or molecules into emerging functional materials is crucial for manipulating material physical properties and innovating device applications. The intercalation of emerging new materials can induce multiple intrinsic changes, such as charge doping, chemical bonding, and lattice expansion, which facilitates the exploration of structural phase transformations, the tuning of symmetry-breaking-related physics, and the creation of brain-inspired advanced devices. Moreover, incorporating various hosts and intercalants enables a series of crystal structures with a rich spectrum of characteristics, greatly expanding the scope and fundamental understanding of existing materials. Herein, we summarize the methods typically used for the intercalation of functional materials. We highlight recent progress in intercalation-based phase transitions and their emerging physics, i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, insulator-metal, superconducting, and charge-density-wave phase transitions. We discuss prospective device applications for intercalation-based phase transitions, i.e., neuromorphic devices. Finally, we provide potential future research lines for promoting its further development.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nonlinear Hall Effect in 2D Antiferromagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators has long been challenging due to their zero spontaneous magnetization and stable insulating state, with this challenge being even more pronounced in the 2D limit. In this letter, we propose the magnon nonlinear Hall effect, a second-order thermal Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel approach to investigate 2D AFM insulators. We demonstrate that in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets, the nonlinear thermal Hall effect of magnons, intrinsically coupled to the magnetic order, can be induced and manipulated by a slight external-field perturbation, in contrast to the fermions or phonons. This coupling also gives rise to an intriguing magnetic-layer dependence of magnon nonlinear Hall response that is absent in the linear regime. For instance, in G-type AFM multilayers, this effect is allowed in odd layers but forbidden in even layers. Moreover, in odd layers, the magnon nonlinear Hall response is suppressed by the AFM interlayer coupling, with the strength decreasing as the layer numbers increases. The remarkable tunability and magnetic-dependent characteristics address the limitations of weak responses in AFM insulators, shedding light on 2D AFM spintronics</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin liquid in the decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet nabokoite KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets realizing the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a promising platform for nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. We carry out a theoretical analysis of the recently synthesized compound nabokoite {\nab} based on a density functional theory energy mapping which establishes an unusual Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a hierarchy of couplings which suggests a description in terms of effective spin liquid models. Owing to the decoration of the square-kagome lattice with a seventh Cu site, nabokoite is characterized by highly frustrated square pyramids that are antiferromagnetically coupled in a chiral arrangement. Employing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to explain the two transitions observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve from the experimental measurements. Remarkably, we show that the low-field phase is only realized when the inter-layer coupling is included. On the other hand, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring a subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. We finally assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method and predict the spin structure factor for comparison with future neutron scattering measurements.</description>

      <title>Interstitial anionic electrons involved superconductivity and T-linear resistivity behavior in electride La3In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides are unique materials because of the existence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs). Due to these loosely bound IAEs and their strong interaction with the framework of cations, electrides can host superconductivity with rather high Tc, especially under high pressure, as predicted in theory. However, the experimental observations of superconductivity in electrides are very rare, let alone the detailed studies on intrinsic properties of single crystals. Here, we report the superconducting and normal-state properties of electride La3In single crystals. La3In shows a type-II superconductivity with Tc ~ 9.4 K and a T-linear resistivity in a wide temperature range. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that the relatively high Tc could be ascribed to the high density of states around the Fermi level caused by short flat bands along R-M direction and the strong electron-phonon coupling, partially derived from the IAEs. Meanwhile, the T-linear resistivity may reflect the significant electronic correlation effect in this material. These findings will shed light on understanding the role of IAEs in superconductivity and open a promising way to explore high-temperature superconductors in electrides.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillary sequential fluid capture in hummingbird-inspired grooved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive and effective fluid capture and transport at small scale is crucial for industrial and medical applications, especially for the realisation of point-of-care tests. Performing these tests involves several steps including biological fluid capture, aliquoting, reaction with reagents at the fluid-device interface, and reading of the results. Ideally, these tests must be fast and offer a large surface-to-volume ratio to achieve rapid and precise diagnostics with a reduced amount of fluid. Such constraints are often contradictory as a high surface-to-volume ratio implies a high hydraulic resistance and hence a decrease in the flow rate. Inspired by the feeding mechanism of hummingbirds, we propose a frugal fluid capture device that takes advantage of elastocapillary deformations to enable concomitant fast liquid transport, aliquoting, and high confinement in the deformed state. The hierarchical design of the device - that consists in vertical grooves stacked on an elastic sheet - enables a two-step sequential fluid capture. Each unit groove mimics the hummingbird's tongue and closes due to capillary forces when a wetting liquid penetrates, yielding the closure of the whole device in a tubular shape, where additional liquid is captured. Combining elasticity, capillarity, and viscous flow, we rationalise the fluid-structure interaction at play both when liquid is scarce - end dipping and capillary rise - and abundant - full dipping. By functionalising the surface of the grooves such a passive device can concomitantly achieve all the steps of point-of-care tests, opening the way for the design of optimal devices for fluid capture and transport in microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of all two-dimensional fragile topological bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing topological materials with specific topological indices is a complex inverse problem, traditionally tackled through manual, intuition-driven methods that are neither scalable nor efficient for exploring the vast space of possible material configurations. In this work, we develop an algorithm that leverages the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy to optimize the Fourier representation of the periodic functions shaping the designer material's characteristics. This includes mass profiles or dielectric tensors for phononic and photonic crystals, respectively, as much as synthetic potentials applicable to electronic and ultra-cold atomic systems. We demonstrate our methodology with a detailed characterization of a class of topological bands known as "fragile topological", showcasing the algorithm's capability to address both topological characteristics and spectral quality. This automation not only streamlines the design process but also significantly expands the potential for identifying and constructing high quality designer topological materials across the wide range of platforms, and is readily extendable to other setups, including higher-dimensional and non-linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reassess the modeling of amorphous silica bilayers as a two-dimensional classical system whose particles interact with an effective pairwise potential. We show that it is possible to reparameterize the potential developed by Roy, Heyde, and Heuer to quantitatively match the structural details of the experimental samples. We then study the glassy dynamics of the reparameterized model at low temperatures. Using appropriate cage-relative correlation functions, which suppress the effect of Mermin-Wagner fluctuations, we highlight the presence of two well-defined Arrhenius regimes separated by a narrow crossover region, which we connect to the thermodynamic anomalies and the changes in the local structure. We find that the bond-orientational order grows steadily below the crossover temperature and is associated to transient crystalline domains of nanometric size. These findings raise fundamental questions about the nature of glass structure in two dimensions and provide guidelines to interpret the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nontrivial topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, are of great interest due to their potential use as information carriers in spintronic memory and logic. Here, we theoretically predict an asymmetric antibimeron (AAB) -- a topological texture in an in-plane magnetized chiral ferromagnet with $D_{2d}$ symmetry, which is yet to be observed experimentally. We show that it can be stabilized by an anisotropic interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction found in materials with $D_{2d}$ symmetry. Using energy considerations, we explain its asymmetric shape formed of an antivortex and a crescent-shaped vortex of opposite core polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AABs of opposite topological charge can be stabilized within the same ferromagnetic film, unlike skyrmions in out-of-plane magnetized films. Employing micromagnetic simulations and analytical Thiele's equation approach, we also investigate current-driven dynamics of the AABs, in particular showing that the topological charge of the system can be controllably changed in AAB collisions. Our results shed light on fundamental understanding of asymmetric topological magnetic solitons and provide guidance for their experimental observation in in-plane magnetized ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Extreme electron-hole drag and negative mobility in the Dirac plasma of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb drag between adjacent electron and hole gases has attracted considerable attention, being studied in various two-dimensional systems, including semiconductor and graphene heterostructures. Here we report measurements of electron-hole drag in the Planckian plasma that develops in monolayer graphene in the vicinity of its Dirac point above liquid-nitrogen temperatures. The frequent electron-hole scattering forces minority carriers to move against the applied electric field due to the drag induced by majority carriers. This unidirectional transport of electrons and holes results in nominally negative mobility for the minority carriers. The electron-hole drag is found to be strongest near-room temperature, despite being notably affected by phonon scattering. Our findings provide better understanding of the transport properties of charge-neutral graphene, reveal limits on its hydrodynamic description and also offer insight into quantum-critical systems in general.</description>

      <title>Non-bulk Superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Single Crystals Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-transport measurements of Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals performed under externally applied pressures up to 73 GPa in diamond anvil cells with either KBr or Nujol oil as pressure media yield signatures of superconductivity with a maximum onset temperature of approximately 31 K. True zero resistance was not observed, consistent with a non-percolating superconducting volume fraction. Magnetization measurements provided corroborating evidence of superconductivity, with a pressure-dependent diamagnetic signal occurring below the onset temperature, and an estimate from the absolute value of the susceptibility suggests a superconducting volume fraction on the order of 10%. We observe sample-to-sample variations in the magnitude and pressure dependence of Tc as well as a dependence on the configuration of electrical contacts on a given sample. Possible causes of this behavior may be significant inhomogeneities in the pressure and/or damage to the samples induced by the pressure media as well as inhomogeneities in the crystals themselves. The results imply that our as-grown Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals are not bulk superconductors but that there is a minority structure present within the crystals that is indeed superconducting.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity pressure and temperature quantum sensing in organic crystals</title>

Abstract: The inherent sensitivity of quantum sensors to their physical environment can make them good reporters of parameters such as temperature, pressure, strain, and electric fields. Here, we present a molecular platform for pressure (P) and temperature (T) sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene. We leverage the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the photoexcited triplet electron in the pentacene molecule, that serves as a sensitive probe for lattice changes in the host para-terphenyl due to pressure or temperature variations. We observe maximal ODMR frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar and df/dT=247 kHz/K, which are over 1,200 times and three times greater, respectively, than those seen in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This results in a &gt;85-fold improvement in pressure sensitivity over best previously reported. The larger variation reflects the weaker nature of the para-terphenyl lattice, with first-principles DFT calculations indicating that even picometer-level shifts in the molecular orbitals due to P, T changes are measurable. The platform offers additional advantages including high levels of sensor doping, narrow ODMR linewidths and high contrasts, and ease of deployment, leveraging the ability for large single crystals at low cost. Overall, this work paves the way for low-cost, optically-interrogated pressure and temperature sensors and lays the foundation for even more versatile sensors enabled by synthetic tunability in designer molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Observing Altermagnetism using Polarized Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are colinear compensated magnets whose magnetic symmetries at zero spin-orbit coupling break spin degeneracy leading to spin-split electronic and magnonic bands that reflect an underlying multipolar order. When there is an approximate $U(1)$ symmetry the magnons in altermagnets are split into equal and opposite chiral pairs. We show that in altermagnets polarized neutrons provide a means to detect the population of time-reversed domains and allow direct measurement of the magnon chirality anisotropy in momentum space -- the central signature of the altermagnetic phase. We demonstrate this response to polarized neutrons in two candidate materials MnF$_2$ and MnTe and show that the presence of these chiralities is stable to small perturbations that break spin-rotation symmetry. This provides a magnonic analogue of spin polarized ARPES that has been used to discern altermagnetism in the electronic band structures of various candidate materials.</description>

      <title>The thermoelectric conversion efficiency problem: Insights from the electron gas thermodynamics close to a phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bottleneck in modern thermoelectric power generation and cooling is the low energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials. The detrimental effects of lattice phonons on performance can be mitigated, but achieving a high thermoelectric power factor remains a major problem because the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity cannot be jointly increased. The conducting electron gas in thermoelectric materials is the actual working fluid that performs the energy conversion, so its properties determine the maximum efficiency that can theoretically be achieved. By relating the thermoelastic properties of the electronic working fluid to its transport properties (considering noninteracting electron systems), we show why the performance of conventional semiconductor materials is doomed to remain low. Analyzing the temperature dependence of the power factor theoretically in 2D systems and experimentally in a thin film, we find that in the fluctuation regimes of an electronic phase transition, the thermoelectric power factor can significantly increase owing to the increased compressibility of the electron gas. We also calculate the ideal thermoelectric conversion efficiency in noninteracting electron systems across a wide temperature range neglecting phonon effects and dissipative coupling to the heat source and sink. Our results show that driving the electronic system to the vicinity of a phase transition can indeed be an innovative route to strong efficiency enhancement, but at the cost of an extremely narrow temperature range for the use of such materials, which in turn precludes potential development for the desired wide range of thermoelectric energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of tension-compression asymmetry from a complete phase-field approach to brittle fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical variational approach to brittle fracture propagation does not distinguish between strain energy accumulation in tension versus compression and consequently results in physically unrealistic cracking under compression. A variety of energy splits have been proposed as a possible remedy. However, a unique energy split that can describe this asymmetry for general loading conditions has not been found. The main objective of this paper is to show that a complete phase-field theory of brittle fracture nucleation and propagation, one that accounts for the material strength at large, can naturally capture the tension-compression asymmetry without an energy split. One such theory has been recently proposed by Kumar et al. (2018). Over the past few years, several studies have shown that this theory is capable of accurately describing fracture nucleation and propagation for materials soft and hard under arbitrary monotonic loading conditions. However, a systematic study of the tension-compression asymmetry that emerges from this theory has not yet been reported. This paper does precisely that. In particular, this paper reports a comprehensive study of crack propagation in two problems, one involving a symmetric tension-compression state and the other involving larger compressive stresses at the crack tip. The results are compared with popular energy splits used in literature. The results show that, remarkably, for the second problem, only the complete theory is able to produce experimentally consistent results.</description>

      <title>Large bulk photovoltaic effect and Fermi surface mediated its enhancement with chemical potential in ZnGeP$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bulk photovoltaic effect is a non-linear response in noncentrosymmetric materials that converts light into DC current. In this work, we investigate the optical linear and non-linear responses in a chalcopyrite semiconductor ZnGeP$_2$. We report large bulk photovoltaics namely shift and circular photogalvanic current conductivities which are 4.46 $\mu$A/V$^2$ and -5.49 $\mu$A/V$^2$ respectively with the incident photo energy around $\sim$ 5 eV at the chemical potential of E$_f$ = 0 eV which increase about 38\% and 81\% respectively at a chemical potential of E$_f$ = 1.52 eV. The systematic evolution of the bulk Fermi surface along with the high symmetry points in three dimensional Brillouin zone reveals the enhancement of bulk photovoltaics with the chemical potential in ZnGeP$_2$. To verify our findings, we further explore the distribution of bulk projected bands and surface Fermi surface distribution in the energy landscape using tight binding Hamiltonian within semi infinite slab geometry. This shows that the augmentation of bulk photovoltaics with the chemical potential is due to the surface Fermi surface states along the high symmetry $\Gamma-Z$ direction in Brillouin zone. Our thorough and detailed study not only provides a deeper understanding about the role of Fermi surface contribution to the bulk photovoltaic responses with chemical potential, but also suggests ZnGeP$_2$ as an ideal candidate for optoelectronics and bulk photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Electrical manipulation of intervalley trions in twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayers at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impressive physics and applications of intra- and interlayer excitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide twisted-bilayer make these systems compelling platforms for exploring the manipulation of their optoelectronic properties through electrical fields. This work studies the electrical control of excitonic complexes in twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer devices at room temperature. Gate-dependent micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals an energy tunability of several meVs originating from the emission of excitonic complexes. Furthermore, our study investigates the twist-angle dependence of valley properties by fabricating devices with stacking angles of $\theta\sim1\degree$, $\theta\sim4\degree$ and $\theta\sim18\degree$. Strengthened by density functional theory calculations, the results suggest that, depending on the twist angle, the conduction band minima and hybridized states at the \textbf{Q}-point promote the formation of intervalley hybrid trions involving the \textbf{Q}-and \textbf{K}-points in the conduction band and the \textbf{K}-point in the valence band. By revealing the gate control of exciton species in twisted homobilayers, our findings open new avenues for engineering multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on ultrathin semiconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Simplifying FFT-based methods for solid mechanics with automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, automatic differentiation simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Furthermore, we illustrate the use of the AD-enhanced FFT method for problems that extend beyond homogenization, such as uncertainty quantification and topology optimization where automatic differentiation simplifies the computation of sensitivities. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general fabrication strategy for freestanding single-crystalline complex oxide device arrays via wet chemical etching-based microfabrication processes and epitaxial lift-off. Here, we used 0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$)O$_3$-0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.7}$Ti$_{0.3}$)O$_3$ (BCZT) as a model relaxor ferroelectric oxide system and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ as the sacrificial layer for demonstration. Arrays of SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) / BCZT / SRO ferroelectric capacitor mesas were first defined and isolated on the growth wafer, and then they were released using epitaxial lift-off with lithography-defined surrounding etching holes, after which the freestanding device arrays were integrated onto a glass substrate. Our proposed strategy sheds light on preparing various freestanding single-crystalline oxide devices and paves the way for their heterogeneous integration onto arbitrary substates.</description>

      <title>Electrical contacts for high performance optoelectronic devices of BaZrS3 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites such as BaZrS3 are promising candidates for next generation optoelectronics such as photodetectors and solar cells. Compared to widely studied polycrystalline thin films, single crystals of BaZrS3 with minimal extended and point defects, are ideal platform to study the material's intrinsic transport properties and to make first-generation optoelectronic devices. However, the surface dielectrics formed on BaZrS3 single crystals due to sulfating or oxidation have led to significant challenges to achieving high quality electrical contacts, and hence, realizing the high-performance optoelectronic devices. Here, we report the development of electrical contact fabrication processes on BaZrS3 single crystals, where various processes were employed to address the surface dielectric issue. Moreover, with optimized electrical contacts fabricated through dry etching, high-performance BaZrS3 photoconductive devices with a low dark current of 0.1 nA at 10 V bias and a fast transient photoresponse with rise and decay time of &lt;0.2 s were demonstrated.</description>

      <title>An Embedding Cluster Approach for Accurate Electronic Structure Calculations of (229)Th:CaF2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent advances of the embedded cluster approach combined with multiconfigurational theory, this work investigates the electronic states in thorium-doped CaF2 crystals. Th:CaF2 is currently establishing as a promising material for solid-state nuclear clocks, which utilize the laser-accessible isomeric state in thorium-229. By comparing simulated absorption spectra of a library of defect configurations with experimental data, we demonstrate the impact of fluorine vacancies and calcium vacancies on the Th:CaF2 electronic structure. Our results indicate that fluorine-deficient sites can introduce local electronic states within the band gap, resonant with the isomer energy, potentially contributing to non-radiative decay or quenching of the Th-229 isomer. We also explore the potential of electron-nuclear bridge mechanisms to enhance nuclear excitation or de-excitation, offering a pathway for more efficient control over the nuclear clock. This study provides key insights for optimizing the crystal environment for nuclear metrology applications and opens new avenues for further experimental and theoretical exploration of thorium-doped ionic crystals.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of the energetics and the local chemical ordering of tungsten-based alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tungsten (W) is considered a leading candidate for structural and functional materials in future fusion energy devices. The most attractive properties of tungsten for magnetic and inertial fusion energy reactors are its high melting point, high thermal conductivity, low sputtering yield, and low long-term disposal radioactive footprint. However, tungsten also presents a very low fracture toughness, primarily associated with inter-granular failure and bulk plasticity, limiting its applications. In recent years, several families of tungsten-based alloys have been explored to overcome the aforementioned limitations of pure tungsten. These might include tungsten-based high-entropy alloys (W-HEAs) and the so-called tungsten-based "smart alloys". In this work, we present a computational approach that uses first-principles DFT electronic structure calculations to understand the effect of the chemical environment on tungsten-based alloys. In particular, we compared the Special Quasi-random Structure (SQS) and the DFT-coupled Monte Carlo (MC-DFT) methods when investigating the short-range order and elastic properties of two equimolar WCrTaTi and WVTaTi W-HEAs, and two WCrTi and WCrY W-SAs. We found that structures after MC-DFT calculation have lower cohesive energies than SQS structures, with shorter lattice constants, and large elastic properties values. Furthermore, distinct element segregation was studied by calculating the SRO parameter and radius distribution function. The total density of states suggested that the existence of SRO could improve the stability of the structure.</description>

Abstract: BCC lattices with twinned meta-crystal architecture inspired by strengthening of bulk metals have significantly improved mechanical performance; however, their deformation behaviour and underlying strengthening mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reveal that twinning causes a transition from bending to stretch-dominated behaviour in BCC lattices, violating the Gibson-Ashby model, and eliciting vast improvements in stiffness (+181%) and strength (+128%). By controlling a heterogenous distribution of twinned grain boundaries, inspired by bimodal harmonic microstructure, we amplify the axial strain energy at location specific sites, further enhancing the stiffness of twinned BCC lattices by 11.1%. Our lattice design philosophy unleashes the potential of cellular materials for high-performance engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic moments on a crystal lattice that interact via magnetic exchange. Yet from this simplicity emerges a remarkable diversity of magnetic states. Some reveal the deep quantum mechanical origins of magnetism, for example, quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in which magnetic moments remain disordered at low temperatures despite being strongly correlated through quantum entanglement. A promising theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual bond-dependent exchange interactions, but experimentally, this model is challenging to realise. Here we show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive an extended pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ octahedra within the honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. We confirm the requisite jeff = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide experimental access to an unexplored region of the Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spin and Orbital Hall Phenomena in Antiferromagnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>

      <title>Investigation of BaTiO$_3$-NiO composite as compact Dielectric Resonator Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compact dielectric resonator antenna has been fabricated on a microstrip transmission line for the purpose of C-band wireless communication using a ceramic material made out of a sintered mixture of BTO and NiO. The antenna parameters are optimized using Ansys HFSS software and verified experimentally. Ni replaces both Ba at A site and Ti at B site. Such a solid solution has a limit depending on the amount of NiO provided during sintering. A complete study of the structural changes and the dielectric constant enables the correlation with the resonating property. All the samples retain the ferroelectric tetragonal P4mm phase with a nominal decrease in the c/a ratio. NiO incorporation in BTO decreases the sintering temperature and shows two types of morphology associated with BTO-like and NiO-like phases. It induces prominent reduction in the permittivity and loss tangent (&lt;0.01) in the range 100Hz to 1MHz. These properties make these samples suitable for DRA application in the C-Band range [4-8 GHz]. Experimental and theoretical assessment using HFSS software yields a C-band signal at ~7.27 GHz.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale structural correlations in a model cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. Here we combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to prominent nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. As advances in scattering techniques yield increasingly comprehensive data, the experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence and tunability of Fermi-pocket and electronic instabilities in layered Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have gained intensive attention as potential high-temperature superconductors, showing similarities and subtle differences to well-known Cuprates. This study introduces a modelling framework to analyze the tunability of electronic structures by focusing on effective orbitals and additional Fermi pockets, mimicking doping or external pressure qualitatively. It investigates the role of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital in interlayer hybridization, which leads to the formation of a second pocket in the Fermi surface. The resulting effective model also predicts specific charge and spin susceptibility in the form of Lindhard susceptibility at wave vector $\mathbf{q_{0}} = (\pi, \pi)$, which can be tuned by doping or pressure. These results provide valuable insights into tunable orbital contributions and their influence on potential ordering and electronic instabilities in Layered Nickelates.</description>

      <title>Dataset of Tensile Properties for Sub-sized Specimens of Nuclear Structural Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical testing with sub-sized specimens plays an important role in the nuclear industry, facilitating tests in confined experimental spaces with lower irradiation levels and accelerating the qualification of new materials. The reduced size of specimens results in different material behavior at the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale, in comparison to standard-sized specimens, which is referred to as the specimen size effect. Although analytical models have been proposed to correlate the properties of sub-sized specimens to standard-sized specimens, these models lack broad applicability across different materials and testing conditions. The objective of this study is to create the first large public dataset of tensile properties for sub-sized specimens used in nuclear structural materials. We performed an extensive literature review of relevant publications and extracted over 1,000 tensile testing records comprising 54 parameters including material type and composition, manufacturing information, irradiation conditions, specimen dimensions, and tensile properties. The dataset can serve as a valuable resource to investigate the specimen size effect and develop computational methods to correlate the tensile properties of sub-sized specimens.</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of structural data to predict electronic properties in near-surface InAs quantum wells</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor crosshatch patterns in thin film heterostructures form as a result of strain relaxation processes and dislocation pile-ups during growth of lattice mismatched materials. Due to their connection with the internal misfit dislocation network, these crosshatch patterns are a complex fingerprint of internal strain relaxation and growth anisotropy. Therefore, this mesoscopic fingerprint not only describes the residual strain state of a near-surface quantum well, but also could provide an indicator of the quality of electron transport through the material. Here, we present a method utilizing computer vision and machine learning to analyze AFM crosshatch patterns that exhibits this correlation. Our analysis reveals optimized electron transport for moderate values of $\lambda$ (crosshatch wavelength) and $\epsilon$ (crosshatch height), roughly 1 $\mu$m and 4 nm, respectively, that define the average waveform of the pattern. Simulated 2D AFM crosshatch patterns are used to train a machine learning model to correlate the crosshatch patterns to dislocation density. Furthermore, this model is used to evaluate the experimental AFM images and predict a dislocation density based on the crosshatch waveform. Predicted dislocation density, experimental AFM crosshatch data, and experimental transport characterization are used to train a final model to predict 2D electron gas mean free path. This model shows electron scattering is strongly correlated with elastic effects (e.g. dislocation scattering) below 200 nm $\lambda_{MFP}$.</description>

      <title>A general machine learning model of aluminosilicate melt viscosity and its application to the surface properties of dry lava planets</title>

Abstract: Ultra-short-period exoplanets like K2-141 b likely have magma oceans on their dayside, which play a critical role in redistributing heat within the planet. This could lead to a warm nightside surface, measurable by the James Webb Space Telescope, offering insights into the planet's structure. Accurate models of properties like viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude, are essential for such studies.
  We present a new model for predicting molten magma viscosity, applicable in diverse scenarios, including magma oceans on lava planets. Using a database of 28,898 viscosity measurements on phospho-alumino-silicate melts, spanning superliquidus to undercooled temperatures and pressures up to 30 GPa, we trained a greybox artificial neural network, refined by a Gaussian process. This model achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE $\approx 0.4 \log_{10}$ Pa$\cdot$s) and can handle compositions from SiO$_2$ to multicomponent magmatic and industrial glasses, accounting for pressure effects up to 30 GPa for compositions such as peridotite.
  Applying this model, we calculated the viscosity of K2-141 b's magma ocean under different compositions. Phase diagram calculations suggest that the dayside is fully molten, with extreme temperatures primarily controlling viscosity. A tenuous atmosphere (0.1 bar) might exist around a 40{\deg} radius from the substellar point. At higher longitudes, atmospheric pressure drops, and by 90{\deg}, magma viscosity rapidly increases as solidification occurs. The nightside surface is likely solid, but previously estimated surface temperatures above 400 K imply a partly molten mantle, feeding geothermal flux through vertical convection.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Band Topology in Twisted Bilayer Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected corner states serve as a key indicator for two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators, yet they have not been experimentally identified in realistic materials. Here, by utilizing the effective tight-binding model and symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between higher-order topological insulators and twisted bilayer kagome lattices. We find that the topologically nontrivial bulk band gap arises in the twisted bilayer kagome lattice system due to twist-induced intervalley scattering, leading to the emergence of higher-order topological insulators with a range of commensurate twist angles, and the higher-order band topology is verified by the second Stiefel-Whitney number and fractionally quantized corner charges. Moreover, we investigate the influence of disorder and charge density wave order on the stability of higher-order topological insulator phases. The results show that the corner states of twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems are robust with respect to disorder and charge density wave. Our work not only provides a feasible approach to realize the readily controllable higher-order topological insulator phases by employing a simple twist technique, but also demonstrates that the twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems exhibit the robustness of higher-order band topology, making it feasible to check above prediction in experiments.</description>
