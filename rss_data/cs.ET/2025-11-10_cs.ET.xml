      <title>WIRE: Write Energy Reduction via Encoding in Phase Change Main Memories (PCM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase Change Memory (PCM) has rapidly progressed and surpassed Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) in terms of scalability and standby energy efficiency. Altering a PCM cell's state during writes demands substantial energy, posing a significant challenge to PCM's role as the primary main memory. Prior research has explored methods to reduce write energy consumption, including the elimination of redundant writes, minimizing cell writes, and employing compact row buffers for filtering PCM main memory accesses. However, these techniques had certain drawbacks like bit-wise comparison of the stored values, preemptive updates increasing write cycles, and poor endurance. In this paper, we propose WIRE, a new coding mechanism through which most write operations force a maximum of one-bit flip. In this coding-based data storage method, we look at the frequent value stack and assign a code word to the most frequent values such that they have a hamming distance of one. In most of the write accesses, writing a value needs one or fewer bit flips which can save considerable write energy. This technique can be augmented with a wear-leveling mechanism at the block level, and rotating the difference bit in the assigned codes, increasing the lifetime of the PCM array at a low cost. Using a full-system evaluation of our method and comparing it to the existing mechanisms, our experimental results for multi-threaded and multi-programmed workloads revealed considerable improvement in lifetime and write energy as well as bit flip reduction.</description>

      <title>SMART-WRITE: Adaptive Learning-based Write Energy Optimization for Phase Change Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and other current transistor-based memories approach their scalability limits, the search for alternative storage methods becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) emerges as a promising candidate due to its scalability, fast access time, and zero leakage power compared to many existing memory technologies. However, PCM has significant drawbacks that currently hinder its viability as a replacement. PCM cells suffer from a limited lifespan because write operations degrade the physical material, and these operations consume a considerable amount of energy. For PCM to be a practical option for data storage-which involves frequent write operations-its cell endurance must be enhanced, and write energy must be reduced. In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that integrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically optimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time operating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write parameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further optimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write parameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write energy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared to the baseline and previous models.</description>

      <title>MDM: Manhattan Distance Mapping of DNN Weights for Parasitic-Resistance-Resilient Memristive Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN) weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.
  PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.
  MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement. Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance, relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering the nonideality factor (NF).
  Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets. Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM DNN accelerators.</description>

      <title>Modulation Schemes for Functionalized Vesicle-based MC Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange through the transmission of signaling molecules (SMs) and holds promise for many innovative applications. However, most existing works in MC rely on simplified transmitter (TX) models that do not account for the physical and biochemical limitations of realistic biological hardware and environments. This work extends previous efforts toward developing models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX model that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by biological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized vesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically designed for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from delayed and imperfectly controllable SM release. The proposed modulation schemes enable low-complexity receiver designs by mitigating memory effects directly at the TX. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed schemes improve communication reliability under realistic biochemical constraints, offering an important step toward physically realizable MC systems.</description>

      <title>Portfolio construction using a sampling-based variational quantum scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient and effective construction of portfolios that adhere to real-world constraints is a challenging optimization task in finance. We investigate a concrete representation of the problem with a focus on design proposals of an Exchange Traded Fund. We evaluate the sampling-based CVaR Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), combined with a local-search post-processing, for solving problem instances that beyond a certain size become classically hard. We also propose a problem formulation that is suited for sampling-based VQA. Our utility-scale experiments on IBM Heron processors involve 109 qubits and up to 4200 gates, achieving a relative solution error of 0.49%. Results indicate that a combined quantum-classical workflow achieves better accuracy compared to purely classical local search, and that hard-to-simulate quantum circuits may lead to better convergence than simpler circuits. Our work paves the path to further explore portfolio construction with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-driven framework triangulating data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While traditional data systems remain fundamental to humanitarian response, they often lack the real-time responsiveness and spatial precision needed to capture increasingly complex patterns of displacement. Internal displacement reached an unprecedented 83.4 million people by the end of 2024, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, data driven approaches to monitor and understand population movements. This report examines how integrating traditional data sources with emerging digital trace data, such as mobile phone GPS and social media activity, can enhance the accuracy, responsiveness, and granularity of displacement monitoring. Drawing on lessons from recent crises, including the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the 2022 floods in Pakistan, the report presents a structured pilot effort that tests the triangulation of multiple data streams to produce more robust and reliable displacement estimates. Statistical indicators derived from digital trace data are benchmarked against the International Organisation for Migration, Displacement Tracking Matrix datasets, to assess their validity, transparency, and scalability. The findings demonstrate how triangulated data approaches can deliver real-time, high-resolution insights into population movements, improving humanitarian resource allocation and intervention planning. The report includes a scalable framework for crisis monitoring that leverages digital innovation to strengthen humanitarian data systems and support evidence-based decision-making in complex emergencies.</description>
