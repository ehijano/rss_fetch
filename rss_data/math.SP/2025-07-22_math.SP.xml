      <title>Operator-differential expressions: regularization and completeness of the root functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an operator-differential expression of the form $$ \ell y=\frac{d^m}{dx^m}\Big(By^{(n)}+Cy\Big), \quad 0&lt;x&lt;1, $$ where $B$ is a linear bounded invertible operator, while $C$ is some finite-dimensional linear operator relatively bounded to the operator of $n$-fold differentiation. To such a form, we can reduce, in particular, various singular differential expressions with the coefficients in negative Sobolev spaces, which creates an alternative to their regularization. In the case when $B$ is an integral Volterra operator of the second kind with a continuous kernel vanishing at the diagonal, we obtain a theorem on completeness of the root functions of an operator generated by the expression $\ell y$ and general irregular separated boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Square Root Bounds for Edge Eigenvector Universality in Sparse Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eigenvectors of random regular graphs behave when projected onto fixed directions. For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the degree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow approximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen bound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\sqrt{d} \cdot N^{-1/6+\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly improves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we prove our $\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities that exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a vector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and (3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control higher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for eigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Analysis on fibred cusp spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a survey of a number of analytic and geometric results on `fibred cusp spaces'. These results cover topics in spectral geometry, in particular analytic torsion and index theory, and boundary value problems. The underlying tools include a careful microlocal analysis of the resolvent and the heat kernel. We include an exposition of the geometric and analytic foundations and sketch the ideas of the proofs of the main theorems.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Schr\"odinger operators on subcovering graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators with real periodic potentials on periodic graphs. The spectra of the operators consist of a finite number of bands. By "rolling up" a periodic graph along some appropriate directions we obtain periodic graphs of smaller dimensions called subcovering graphs. For example, rolling up a planar hexagonal lattice along different directions will lead to nanotubes with various chiralities. We describe connections between spectra of the Schr\"odinger operators on a periodic graph and its subcoverings. In particular, we provide a simple criterion for the subcovering graph to be isospectral to the original periodic graph. By isospectrality of periodic graphs we mean that the spectra of the Schr\"odinger operators on the graphs consist of the same number of bands and the corresponding bands coincide as sets. We also obtain asymptotics of the band edges of the Schr\"odinger operator on the subcovering graph as the "chiral" (roll up) vectors are long enough.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps between finite-dimensional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be unital finite-dimensional complex algebras, each equipped with the unique Hausdorff vector topology. Denote by $\mathrm{Max}(\mathcal{A})=\{\mathcal{M}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{M}_p\}$ and $\mathrm{Max}(\mathcal{B})=\{\mathcal{N}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{N}_q\}$ the sets of all maximal ideals of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, respectively, and define the quantities $$k_i:=\sqrt{\dim(\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{M}_i)}, \, \, 1 \leq i \leq p \quad \text{ and } \quad m:=\sum_{j=1}^q\sqrt{\dim(\mathcal{B}/\mathcal{N}_j)},$$ which are positive integers by Wedderburn's structure theorem. We show that there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ (i.e. $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(x))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(x)$ for all $x \in \mathcal{A}$) if and only if the linear Diophantine equation $$ k_1x_1 + \cdots + k_px_p = m $$ has a non-negative integer solution $(x_1,\ldots,x_p)$. Moreover, all such maps $\phi$ are spectrum preserving (i.e. $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(x))=\mathrm{sp}(x)$ for all $x \in \mathcal{A}$) if and only if each non-negative solution consists only of positive integers.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants so that it reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions of $k$-leaf-connected graphs and spanning trees with bounded total $k$-excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chv\'{a}tal and Erd\"{o}s [Discrete Math. 2 (1972) 111-113] stated that, for an $m$-connected graph $G$, if its independence number $\alpha(G)\leq m-1$, then $G$ is Hamilton-connected. Note that $k$-leaf-connectedness is a natural generalization of Hamilton-connectedness of a graph. Ozeki and Yamashita [Graphs Combin. 27 (2011) 1-26] posed an open problem: What is the sufficient condition based on the independence number for an $m$-connected graph to be $k$-leaf-connected? In this paper, we prove that if $\alpha(G)\leq m-k+1,$ then an $m$-connected graph $G$ is $k$-leaf-connected. This not only answers the open problem of Ozeki and Yamashita, but also extends Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\"{o}s Theorem. As applications, we present sufficient spectral conditions for an $m$-connected graph to be $k$-leaf-connected.
  Let $k\geq 2$ be an integer and $T$ be a spanning tree of a connected graph. The total $k$-excess $te(T,k)$ is the summation of the $k$-excesses of all vertices in $T$, namely, $te(T,k)=\sum_{v\in V(T)}\mbox{max}\{0, d_{T}(v)-k\}.$ One can see that $T$ is a spanning $k$-tree if and only if $te(T,k)=0$. Fan, Goryainov, Huang and Lin [Linear Multilinear Algebra 70 (2022) 7264-7275] presented sufficient spectral conditions for a connected graph to contain a spanning $k$-tree. We in this paper propose sufficient conditions in terms of the spectral radius for a connected graph to contain a spanning tree with $te(T,k)\leq b$, where $b\geq0$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>
