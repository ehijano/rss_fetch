      <title>Ergodic and non-ergodic properties of disordered SU(3) chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-abelian symmetries are thought to be incompatible with many-body localization, but have been argued to produce in certain disordered systems a broad non-ergodic regime distinct from many-body localization. In this context, we present a numerical study of properties of highly-excited eigenstates of disordered chains with SU(3) symmetry. We find that while weakly disordered systems rapidly thermalize, strongly-disordered systems indeed exhibit non-thermal signatures over a large range of system sizes, similar to the one found in previously studied SU(2) systems. Our analysis is based on the spectral, entanglement, and thermalization properties of eigenstates obtained through large-scale exact diagonalization exploiting the full SU(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Geometry-free renormalization of directed networks: scale-invariance and reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has tried to extend the concept of renormalization, which is naturally defined for geometric objects, to more general networks with arbitrary topology. The current attempts do not naturally apply to directed networks, for instance because they are based on the identification of (necessarily symmetric) inter-node distances arising from geometric embeddings or on the definition of Hermitian Laplacian operators requiring symmetric adjacency matrices in spectral approaches. Here we show that the Scale-Invariant Model, recently proposed as an approach to consistently model undirected networks at arbitrary (and possibly multi-scale) resolution levels, can be extended coherently to directed networks without the requirement of an embedding geometry or Laplacian structure. Moreover, it can account for nontrivial reciprocity, i.e. the empirically well-documented tendency of links to occur in mutual pairs more or less often than predicted by chance. After deriving the renormalization rules for networks with arbitrary reciprocity, we consider various examples. In particular we propose the first multiscale model of the international trade network with nontrivial reciprocity and an annealed model where positive reciprocity emerges spontaneously from coarse-graining. In the latter case, the renormalization process defines a group, not only a semigroup, and therefore allows to fine-grain networks to arbitrarily small scales. These results strengthen the notion that network renormalization can be defined in a much more general way than required by geometric or spectral approaches, because it needs only node-specific (metric-free) features and can coexist with the asymmetry of directed networks.</description>

      <title>Scattering Expansion for Localization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a perturbative approach to disordered systems in one spatial dimension that accesses the full range of phase disorder and clarifies the connection between localization and phase information. We consider a long chain of identically disordered scatterers and expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer. As an example application, we show analytically that in a discrete-time quantum walk, the localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of phase disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease). More generally, we obtain to all orders in the expansion a particular non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the transmission coefficient logarithm and reflection phase. Furthermore, we show that for weak local reflection strength, a version of the scaling theory of localization holds: the joint distribution is determined by just three parameters.</description>

Abstract: We present a perturbative approach to disordered systems in one spatial dimension that accesses the full range of phase disorder and clarifies the connection between localization and phase information. We consider a long chain of identically disordered scatterers and expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer. We apply this expansion to several examples, including the Anderson model, a general class of periodic-on-average-random potentials, and a two-component discrete-time quantum walk, showing analytically in the latter case that the localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of phase disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease). More generally, we obtain to all orders in the expansion a particular non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the transmission coefficient logarithm and reflection phase. Furthermore, we show that for weak local reflection strength, a version of the scaling theory of localization holds: the joint distribution is determined by just three parameters.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group flow, Optimal Transport and Diffusion-based Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models represent a forefront direction in generative AI research today. Recent studies in physics have suggested that the renormalization group (RG) can be conceptualized as a diffusion process. This insight motivates us to develop a novel diffusion-based generative model by reversing the momentum-space RG flow. We establish a framework that interprets RG flow as optimal transport gradient flow, which minimizes a functional analogous to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, thereby bridging statistical physics and information theory. Our model applies forward and reverse diffusion processes in Fourier space, exploiting the sparse representation of natural images in this domain to efficiently separate signal from noise and manage image features across scales. By introducing a scale-dependent noise schedule informed by a dispersion relation, the model optimizes denoising performance and image generation in Fourier space, taking advantage of the distinct separation of macro and microscale features. Experimental validations on standard datasets demonstrate the model's capability to generate high-quality images while significantly reducing training time compared to existing image-domain diffusion models. This approach not only enhances our understanding of the generative processes in images but also opens new pathways for research in generative AI, leveraging the convergence of theoretical physics, optimal transport, and machine learning principles.</description>

      <title>Scalar field Restricted Boltzmann Machine as an ultraviolet regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are well-known tools used in Machine Learning to learn probability distribution functions from data. We analyse RBMs with scalar fields on the nodes from the perspective of lattice field theory. Starting with the simplest case of Gaussian fields, we show that the RBM acts as an ultraviolet regulator, with the cutoff determined by either the number of hidden nodes or a model mass parameter. We verify these ideas in the scalar field case, where the target distribution is known, and explore implications for cases where it is not known using the MNIST data set. We also demonstrate that infrared modes are learnt quickest.</description>
