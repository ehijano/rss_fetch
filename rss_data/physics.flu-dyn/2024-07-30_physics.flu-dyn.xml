      <title>Reinforcement learning for anisotropic p-adaptation and error estimation in high-order solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automate and optimize anisotropic p-adaptation in high-order h/p solvers using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The dynamic RL adaptation uses the evolving solution to adjust the high-order polynomials. We develop an offline training approach, decoupled from the main solver, which shows minimal overcost when performing simulations. In addition, we derive a RL-based error estimation approach that enables the quantification of local discretization errors. The proposed methodology is agnostic to both the computational mesh and the partial differential equation being solved.
  The application of RL to mesh adaptation offers several benefits. It enables automated, adaptive mesh refinement, reducing the need for manual intervention. It optimizes computational resources by dynamically allocating high-order polynomials where necessary and minimizing refinement in stable regions. This leads to computational cost savings while maintaining solution accuracy. Furthermore, RL allows for the exploration of unconventional mesh adaptations, potentially enhancing the accuracy and robustness of simulations. This work extends our original research, offering a more robust, reproducible, and generalizable approach applicable to complex three-dimensional problems. We provide validation for laminar and turbulent cases: circular cylinders, Taylor Green Vortex and a 10MW wind turbine to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A New Higher-Order Super Compact Finite Difference Scheme to Study Three-Dimensional Non-Newtonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new higher-order accurate super compact (HOSC) finite difference scheme for solving complex unsteady three-dimensional (3D) non-Newtonian fluid flow problems. As per the author's knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first ever developed finite difference scheme to solve three-dimensional non-Newtonian flow problem. Not only that, the proposed method is fourth-order accurate in space variables and second-order accurate in time. Also, the proposed scheme utilizes only seven directly adjacent grid points, at the $(n+1)^{th}$ time level, around which the finite difference discretization is made. The governing equations are solved using a time-marching methodology, and pressure is calculated using a pressure-correction strategy based on the modified artificial compressibility method. Using the power-law viscosity model, we tackle the benchmark problem of a 3D lid-driven cavity, systematically analyzing the varied rheological behavior of shear-thinning ($n=0.5$), shear-thickening $(n=1.5)$, and Newtonian $(n=1.0)$ fluids across different Reynolds numbers $(Re= 1, 50, 100, 200)$. Both Newtonian and non-Newtonian results are carefully investigated in terms of streamlines, velocity variation, pressure distributions, and viscosity contours, and the computed results are validated with the existing benchmark results. The findings demonstrate excellent agreement with the existing results. This extensive analysis, using the new HOSC scheme, not only increases our understanding of non-Newtonian fluid behavior but also provides a robust foundation for future research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>WindsorML -- High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>The flow field due to a sphere moving in a viscous, density stratified fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flow field induced by a sphere translating in a viscous density-stratified ambient, specifically, in the limit of small Reynolds $(Re = \rho U a/\mu \ll 1)$, and viscous Richardson numbers $(Ri_v = \gamma a^3 g/\mu U\ll 1)$, and large Peclet number $(Pe = Ua/D\gg 1)$. Here, $a$ is the sphere radius, $U$ its translational velocity, $\rho$ an appropriate reference density within the Boussinesq framework, $\mu$ the ambient viscosity, $\gamma$ the absolute value of the background density gradient, and $D$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For the scenario where buoyancy forces first become comparable to viscous forces at large distances, corresponding to the Stokes-stratification regime defined by $Re \ll Ri_v^{1/3} \ll 1$ for $Pe \gg 1$, important flow features such as a vertical reverse jet and a horizontal wake, on scales larger than the primary screening length of $\mathcal{O}(aRi_v^{-1/3})$, have been identified by Varanasi and Subramanian (2022). Here, we show that the reverse jet is only the central portion of a columnar structure with multiple annular cells. In the absence of diffusion this columnar structure extends to downstream infinity with the number of annular cells diverging in this limit. We provide expressions for the boundary of the structure, and the number of cells within, as a function of the downstream distance. For small but finite diffusion, two additional length scales emerge - a secondary screening length of $O(aRi_v^{-1/2}Pe^{1/2})$, where diffusion starts to smear out density variations across cells, leading to exponentially decaying flow field; and a tertiary screening length, of $O(aRi_v^{-1/2}Pe^{1/2}\ln(Ri_v^{-1}Pe^3))$, beyond which the columnar structure ceases to exist and the downstream disturbance field reverts from an exponential to eventual algebraic decay, analogous to that prevalent at large distances upstream.</description>

      <title>Cross-variable amplitude-frequency coupling during intermittency in a turbulent thermoacoustic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate flame-acoustic interactions in a turbulent combustor during the state of intermittency before the onset of thermoacoustic instability using complex networks. Experiments are performed in a turbulent bluff-body stabilized dump combustor where the inlet airflow rate is varied (a) quasi-statically and (b) continuously. We construct a natural visibility graph from the local heat release rate fluctuations at each location. Comparing the average degree during epochs of high- and low-amplitude acoustic pressure oscillations (p') during the state of intermittency, we detect frequency modulation in heat release rate fluctuations. Through this approach, we discover unique spatial patterns of cross-variable coupling between the frequency of heat release rate fluctuations and amplitude of p'. The frequency of local heat release rate fluctuations increases in regions of flame anchoring owing to high-frequency excitation of the flow and flame during epochs of high-amplitude p' dynamics. On the other hand, the frequency of heat release rate fluctuations decreases in regions associated with flame front distortions by large coherent vortices. In experiments with continuously varying airflow rates, the spatial pattern of frequency modulation varies with an increase in the average amplitude of p' owing to an increase in the epochs of periodic p' dynamics and the size of vortices forming in the flow. Moreover, we discover that the frequency of heat release rate fluctuations decreases even in regions of flame anchoring when very large coherent structures are shed in the flow, causing dynamic shifts in the location of flame anchoring. Our analysis thus reveals and explains rich spatial patterns of flame-acoustic interactions in turbulent reacting flows.</description>

      <title>Utility of High-Order Scheme for Unsteady Flow Simulations: Comparison with Second-Order Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to investigate the utility and effectiveness of the high-order scheme for simulating unsteady turbulent flows. To achieve it, the studies were conducted from two perspectives: (i) the ability of different numerical schemes for turbulence problems under the same set of meshes; and (ii) the accuracy and stability of higher-order schemes for solving turbulence statistics for different mesh types (hexahedral, tetrahedral, and polyhedral cells). The simulations employ the third-order scheme for spatial discretization of the governing equations, while a widely-used second-order solver, namely pisoFoam, was employed for comparison. This study considers the canonical cases of the Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) problem at Re=100, 1600 and flow past a sphere at Re=10000 to address the aforementioned two key issues. For the TGV case, the high-order model significantly improves the numerical accuracy with convergence rates and reduces the numerical dissipation of nearly 1/10 of pisoFoam. In the latter case, the high-order scheme with large-eddy simulation (LES) accurately predicts the vortex structures and the flow instability, regardless of grid type. However, pisoFoam is found to be sensitive to mesh types, which results in numerous non-physical structures in the flow field due to numerical noise rather than flow physics, particularly for tetrahedral cells. Furthermore, for the typical low- and high-order flow statistics, the numerical results predicted by the present model show better agreement with the reference data and have less dependence on the type of grids compared with the conventional scheme. In addition, the obtained energy spectrum by the high-order solver accurately captures the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability and the vortex shedding frequency, while these important features are less pronounced by the traditional low-order model.</description>

      <title>POREMAPS: A finite difference based Porous Media Anisotropic Permeability Solver for Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous materials are ubiquitous in various engineering and geological applications, where their permeability plays a critical role in viscous fluid flow and transport phenomena. Understanding and characterizing the microscale properties, the effective hydraulic parameters, and also the anisotropy of porous materials are essential for accurate modeling and predicting fluid flow behavior. The study pursues the Digital Rock Physics approach to retrieve intrinsic permeability and its evolution in anisotropic configurations of porous media, which are subjected to pore space alterations. Therefore, we discuss the development and implementation of a computational framework based on the finite difference method to solve the pseudo-unsteady Stokes equations for fluid flow on the pore scale. We present an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of this numerical method for large voxel-based data sets originating from different image-based experimental setups. A comprehensive variety of benchmarks has been conducted to assess and evaluate the performance of the proposed solver. The solver's compatibility with huge domain sizes generated by state-of-the-art imaging techniques is demonstrated. We investigate an open-cell foam undergoing deformation, observing that contrary to initial expectations, no anisotropy emerges. Further, we examine a microfluidic cell experiencing precipitation within its pore space, resulting in clear anisotropic development during the clogging process.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for $N$-phase Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with non-matching densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous $N$-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for $N$-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing $N$-phase models and facilitates the computation of $N$-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

      <title>A Novel Gaussian filter-based Pressure Correction Technique with Super Compact Scheme for Unsteady 3D Incompressible, Viscous Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with a novel Gaussian filter-based pressure correction technique with a super compact higher order finite difference scheme for solving unsteady three-dimensional (3D) incompressible, viscous flows. This pressure correction technique offers significant advantages in terms of optimizing computational time by taking minimum iterations to reach the required accuracy, making it highly efficient and cost-effective. Pressure fields often exhibit highly nonlinear behavior, and employing the Gaussian filter can help to enhance their reliability by reducing noise and uncertainties. On the other hand, the super compact scheme uses minimum grid points to produce second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space variables. The main focus of this study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency and minimize the computational cost of solving complex fluid flow problems. The super compact scheme utilizes 19 grid points at the known time level (i.e., $n^{th}$ time level) and only seven grid points from the unknown time level (i.e., $n + 1$ time level). By employing the above strategies, it becomes possible to notably decrease computational expenses while maintaining the accuracy of the computational scheme for solving complex fluid flow problems. We have implemented our methodology across three distinct scenarios: the 3D Burger's equation having analytical solution, and two variations of the lid-driven cavity problem. The outcomes of our numerical simulations exhibit a remarkable concordance, aligning exceptionally well with both the analytical benchmarks and previously validated numerical findings for the cavity problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the soft pinning effect in the dynamics and the structure dynamics correlation in multicomponent supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multicomponent liquids by increasing the mass of $15\%$ of the particles in a binary Kob-Andersen model. We find that the heavy particles have dual effects on the lighter particles. At higher temperatures, there is a significant decoupling of the dynamics between heavier and lighter particles, with the former resembling a pinned particle to the latter. The dynamics of the lighter particles slow down due to the excluded volume around the nearly immobile heavier particles. Conversely, at lower temperatures, there is a coupling between the dynamics of the heavier and lighter particles. The heavier particles' mass slows down the dynamics of both types of particles. This makes the soft pinning effect of the heavy particles questionable in this regime. We demonstrate that as the mass of the heavy particles increases, the coupling of the dynamics between the lighter and heavier particles weakens. Consequently, the heavier the mass of the heavy particles, the more effectively they act as soft pinning centres in both high and low-temperature regimes. A key finding is that akin to the pinned system, the self and collective dynamics of the lighter particles decouple from each other as the mass of the heavy particles has a more pronounced impact on the latter. We analyze the structure dynamics correlation by considering the system under the binary and modified quaternary framework, the latter describing the pinned system. Our findings indicate that whenever the heavy mass particles function as soft pinning centres, the modified quaternary framework predicts a higher correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time. The coordinate-based formulation naturally leads to robustness with respect to discretization, allowing an excellent trade-off between computational cost (memory footprint and training time) and accuracy. The method is demonstrated on two industrially relevant applications: a RANS dataset of the two-dimensional compressible flow over a transonic airfoil and a dataset of the surface pressure distribution over 3D wings, including shape, inflow condition, and control surface deflection variations. On the considered test cases, our approach achieves a more than three times lower test error and significantly improves generalization error on unseen geometries compared to state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures. Remarkably, the method can perform inference five order of magnitude faster than the high fidelity solver on the RANS transonic airfoil dataset.

      <title>Aging and memory of transitional turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent classification of the onset of turbulence as a directed percolation (DP) phase transition has been applied to all major shear flows including pipe, channel, Couette and boundary layer flows. A cornerstone of the DP analogy is the memoryless (Poisson) property of turbulent sites. We here show that, for the classic case of channel flow, neither the decay nor the proliferation of turbulent stripes is memoryless. As demonstrated by a standard analysis of the respective survival curves, channel stripes age. Consequently, the one to one mapping between turbulent stripes and active DP-sites is not fulfilled. In addition, the interpretation of turbulence as a chaotic saddle with supertransient properties, the basis of recent theoretical progress, does not apply to individual localized stripes. The discrepancy between channel flow and the established transition model illustrates that seemingly minor geometrical differences between flows can give rise to instabilities and growth mechanisms that fundamentally alter the nature of the transition to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of reacting flows via Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the quantum computing of reacting flows by simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics. The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in combustion.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly exceeds the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>

      <title>Modeling of high-pressure transient gas-liquid flow in M-shaped jumpers of subsea gas production systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-phase flow with low liquid loads is common in high-pressure natural gas offshore gathering and transmission pipelines. During gas production slowdowns or shutdowns, an accumulation of liquid in the lower sections of subsea pipelines may occur. This phenomenon is observed in jumpers that connect different units in deep-water subsea gas production facilities. The displacement of the accumulated liquid during production ramp-up induces temporal variations in pressure drop across the jumper and forces on its elbows, resulting in flow-induced vibrations (FIV) that pose potential risks to the structural integrity of the jumper. To bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and field conditions, transient 3D numerical simulations were conducted using the OpenFOAM software. These simulations facilitated the development of a mechanistic model to elucidate the factors contributing to increased pressure and forces during the liquid purging process. The study examined the influence of gas pressure level, pipe diameter, initially accumulated liquid amount, liquid properties, and gas mass flow rate on the transient pressure drop and the forces acting on the jumper's elbows. The critical gas production rate required for complete liquid removal of the accumulated liquid was determined, and scaling rules were proposed to predict the effects of gas pressure and pipe diameter on this critical value. The dominant frequencies of pressure and force fluctuations were identified, with low-pressure systems exhibiting frequencies associated with two-phase flow phenomena and high-pressure systems showing frequencies attributed to acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Resolving turbulence and drag over textured surfaces using texture-less simulations: the case of slip/no-slip textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of surface texture on an overlying turbulent flow for textures made of an alternating slip/no-slip pattern, a common model for superhydrophobic surfaces, but also a particularly simple form of texture. For texture sizes $L^+ \gtrsim 25$, the texture effectively imposes homogeneous slip boundary conditions on the overlying, background turbulence, but this is not its sole effect. The effective conditions only produce an origin offset on the background turbulence, which remains otherwise smooth-wall-like. For actual textures, however, for $L^+ \gtrsim 25$ the flow progressively departs from this smooth-wall-like regime, resulting in additional shear Reynolds stress and increased drag, in a non-homogeneous fashion not reproduced by the effective boundary conditions. We focus on the underlying physical mechanism of this phenomenon. We argue that it is caused by the non-linear interaction of the texture-coherent flow, directly induced by the surface topology, and the background turbulence, as it acts directly on the latter and alters it, not at the boundary where effective conditions are imposed, but within the flow itself. The interaction acts as a forcing on the governing equations of the background turbulence, and takes the form of cross-advective terms between the latter and the texture-coherent flow. We show this with simulations with the texture removed and additional, forcing terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, in addition to the effective boundary conditions. The forcing captures the effect of the non-linear interaction on the background turbulence without the need to resolve the texture. When the forcing is derived accounting for the background turbulence amplitude-modulating the texture-coherent flow, it captures the changes in the flow up to $L^+ \approx 70$--$100$, including the roughness function and also the changes in the flow statistics and structure.</description>

      <title>Onset of global instability in a premixed annular V-flame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate self-excited axisymmetric oscillations of a lean premixed methane--air V-flame in a laminar annular jet. The flame is anchored near the rim of the centrebody, forming an inverted cone, while the strongest vorticity is concentrated along the outer shear layer of the annular jet. Consequently, the reaction and vorticity dynamics are largely separated, except where they coalesce near the flame tip. The global eigenmodes corresponding to the linearised reacting flow equations around the steady base state are computed in an axisymmetric setting. We identify an arc branch of eigenmodes exhibiting strong oscillations at the flame tip. The associated eigenvalues are robust with respect to domain truncation and numerical discretisation, and they become destabilised as the Reynolds number increases. The frequency of the leading eigenmode is found to correspond to the Lagrangian disturbance advection time from the nozzle outlet to the flame tip. Nonlinear time-resolved simulation further reveals notable hysteresis phenomena in the subcritical regime prior to instability. Hence, even when the flame is linearly stable, perturbations of sufficient amplitude can trigger limit-cycle oscillations and higher-dimensional dynamics sustained by nonlinear feedback. A Monte Carlo simulation of passive tracers in the unsteady flame suggests a nonlinear non-local instability mechanism. Notably, linear analysis of the subcritical time-averaged limit-cycle state yields eigenvalues that do not match the nonlinear periodic oscillation frequencies, attributed to the fundamentally nonlinear dynamics of the subcritical V-flame instability, where the dichromatic, non-local interaction cannot be approximated as a simple distortion of the mean flow.</description>

      <title>Unfolding Time: Generative Modeling for Turbulent Flows in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study in turbulent flow simulation demonstrated the potential of generative diffusion models for fast 3D surrogate modeling. This approach eliminates the need for specifying initial states or performing lengthy simulations, significantly accelerating the process. While adept at sampling individual frames from the learned manifold of turbulent flow states, the previous model lacks the capability to generate sequences, hindering analysis of dynamic phenomena. This work addresses this limitation by introducing a 4D generative diffusion model and a physics-informed guidance technique that enables the generation of realistic sequences of flow states. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can successfully sample entire subsequences from the turbulent manifold, even though generalizing from individual frames to sequences remains a challenging task. This advancement opens doors for the application of generative modeling in analyzing the temporal evolution of turbulent flows, providing valuable insights into their complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Emergence and Growth Dynamics of Wetting-induced Phase Separation on Soft Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid droplets on soft solids, such as soft polymeric gels, can induce substantial surface deformations, leading to the formation of wetting ridges at contact points. While these contact ridges have been shown to govern the rich surface mechanics on compliant substrates, the inherently divergent characteristics of contact points and the multiphase nature of soft reticulated gels pose great challenges for continuum mechanical theories in modeling soft wetting phenomena. In this study, we report in-situ experimental characterizations of the emergence and growth dynamics of the wetting-induced phase separation. The measurements demonstrate how the migration of free chains prevents the stress singularities at contact points. Based on the Onsager variational principle, we present a phenomenological model that effectively captures the extraction process of free chains, including a crossover from a short-term diffusive state to a long-term equilibrium state. By comparing model predictions with experimental results for varied crosslinking densities, we reveal how the intrinsic material parameters of soft gels dictate phase separation dynamics.</description>
