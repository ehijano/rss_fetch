      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal geographic placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in drinking water distribution networks (WDNs), with a specific focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is indeed inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, and as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a simple algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The presented algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic system sciences and observability theory, and yields sensor placements that are robust to hydraulic changes. Thorough case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <title>Effective Capacity of a Battery Energy Storage System Captive to a Wind Farm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind energy's role in the global electric grid is set to expand significantly. New York State alone anticipates offshore wind farms (WFs) contributing 9GW by 2035. Integration of energy storage emerges as crucial for this advancement. In this study, we focus on a WF paired with a captive battery energy storage system (BESS). We aim to ascertain the capacity credit for a BESS with specified energy and power ratings. Unlike prior methods rooted in reliability theory, we define a power alignment function, which leads to a straightforward definition of capacity and incremental capacity for the BESS. We develop a solution method based on a linear programming formulation. Our analysis utilizes wind data, collected by NYSERDA off Long Island's coast and load demand data from NYISO. Additionally, we present theoretical insights into BESS sizing and a key time-series property influencing BESS capacity, aiding in simulating wind and demand for estimating BESS energy requirements.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally Robust Control Strategy for Frequency Safety based on Koopman Operator Described System Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the proportion of renewable energy and power electronics in the power system increases, modeling frequency dynamics under power deficits becomes more challenging. Although data-driven methods help mitigate these challenges, they are exposed to data noise and training errors, leading to uncertain prediction errors. To address uncertain and limited statistical information of prediction errors, we introduce a distributionally robust data-enabled emergency frequency control (DREFC) framework. It aims to ensure a high probability of frequency safety and allows for adjustable control conservativeness for decision makers. Specifically, DREFC solves a min-max optimization problem to find the optimal control that is robust to distribution of prediction errors within a Wasserstein-distance-based ambiguity set. With an analytical approximation for VaR constraints, we achieve a computationally efficient reformulations. Simulations demonstrate that DREFC ensures frequency safety, low control costs and low computation time.</description>

      <title>Accurate Calculation of Switching Events in Electromagnetic Transient Simulation Considering State Variable Discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calculation of switching events is important for electromagnetic transient simulation to obtain reliable results. The common presumption of continuous differential state variables could prevent the accurate calculation, thus leading to unreliable results. This paper explores accurately calculating switching events without presuming continuous differential state variables. Possibility of the calculation is revealed by the proposal of related methods. Feasibility and accuracy of the proposed methods are demonstrated and analyzed via numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Sliding Mode Roll Control of Active Suspension Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle roll control has been a well studied problem. One of the ubiquitous methods to mitigate vehicle rollover in the automobile industry is via a mechanical anti-roll bar. However with the advent of electric vehicles, rollover mitigation can be pursued using electric actuation. In this work, we study a roll control algorithm using sliding mode control for active suspension vehicles, where the actuation for the roll control signal is generated by electric motors independently at the four corners of the vehicle. This technology precludes the need for any mechanical actuation which is often slower as well as any anti-roll bar to mitigate vehicle rollover situations. We provide an implementation of the proposed algorithm and conduct numerical experiments to validate the functionality and effectiveness. Specifically, we perform Slalom and J-turn maneuvering tests on an active suspension electric vehicle with sliding model roll control and it is shown to mitigate rollover by atleast 50$\%$ compared to passive suspension vehicles, while simultaneously maintaining rider comfort.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Robustness of Value and Policy Iteration for the Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits and extends the convergence and robustness properties of value and policy iteration algorithms for discrete-time linear quadratic regulator problems. In the model-based case, we extend current results concerning the region of exponential convergence of both algorithms. In the case where there is uncertainty on the value of the system matrices, we provide input-to-state stability results capturing the effect of model parameter uncertainties. Our findings offer new insights into these algorithms at the heart of several approximate dynamic programming schemes, highlighting their convergence and robustness behaviors. Numerical examples illustrate the significance of some of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Attack-Resilient Platooning Against False Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed vehicle platooning control and coordination strategy. We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combing a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in simulation against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and we extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.</description>

      <title>A Continuification-Based Control Solution for Large-Scale Shepherding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the large-scale shepherding control problem using a continuification-based strategy. We consider a scenario in which a large group of follower agents (targets) must be confined within a designated goal region through indirect interactions with a controllable set of leader agents (herders). Our approach transforms the microscopic agent-based dynamics into a macroscopic continuum model via partial differential equations (PDEs). This formulation enables efficient, scalable control design for the herders' behavior, with guarantees of global convergence. Numerical and experimental validations in a mixed-reality swarm robotics framework demonstrate the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Finding Control Invariant Sets via Lipschitz Constants of Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control invariant sets play an important role in safety-critical control and find broad application in numerous fields such as obstacle avoidance for mobile robots. However, finding valid control invariant sets of dynamical systems under input limitations is notoriously difficult. We present an approach to safely expand an initial set while always guaranteeing that the set is control invariant. Specifically, we define an expansion law for the boundary of a set and check for control invariance using Linear Programs (LPs). To verify control invariance on a continuous domain, we leverage recently proposed Lipschitz constants of LPs to transform the problem of continuous verification into a finite number of LPs. Using concepts from differentiable optimization, we derive the safe expansion law of the control invariant set and show how it can be interpreted as a second invariance problem in the space of possible boundaries. Finally, we show how the obtained set can be used to obtain a minimally invasive safety filter in a Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework. Our work is supported by theoretical results as well as numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Voltage Support Capability Analysis of Grid-Forming Inverters with Current-Limiting Control Under Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage support capability is critical for grid-forming (GFM) inverters with current-limiting control (CLC) during grid faults. Despite the findings on the voltage support for symmetrical grid faults, its applicability to more common but complex asymmetrical grid faults has yet to be verified rigorously. This letter fills the gap in the voltage support capability analysis for asymmetrical grid faults by establishing and analyzing positive- and negative-sequence equivalent circuit models, where the virtual impedance is adopted to emulate various CLCs. It is discovered that matching the phase angle of the virtual impedance, emulated by the CLC, with that of the composed impedance from the capacitor to the fault location can maximize the voltage support capability of GFM inverters under asymmetrical grid faults. Rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental results verify this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Joint torques prediction of a robotic arm using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate dynamic models are crucial for many robotic applications. Traditional approaches to deriving these models are based on the application of Lagrangian or Newtonian mechanics. Although these methods provide a good insight into the physical behaviour of the system, they rely on the exact knowledge of parameters such as inertia, friction and joint flexibility. In addition, the system is often affected by uncertain and nonlinear effects, such as saturation and dead zones, which can be difficult to model. A popular alternative is the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques - e.g., Neural Networks (NNs) - in the context of a "black-box" methodology. This paper reports on our experience with this approach for a real-life 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulator. Specifically, we considered several NN architectures: single NN, multiple NNs, and cascade NN. We compared the performance of the system by using different policies for selecting the NN hyperparameters. Our experiments reveal that the best accuracy and performance are obtained by a cascade NN, in which we encode our prior physical knowledge about the dependencies between joints, complemented by an appropriate optimisation of the hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Effect of the geometry of butt-joint implant-supported restorations on the fatigue life of prosthetic screws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statement of problem. Dental implant geometry affects the mechanical performance and fatigue behavior of butt-joint implant-supported restorations. However, failure of the implant component has been generally studied by ignoring the prosthetic screw, which is frequently the critical restoration component Purpose. Evaluate the effect of 3 main implant geometric parameters: the implant body diameter, the platform diameter, and the implant-abutment connection type (external versus internal butt-joint) on the fatigue life of the prosthetic screw. The experimental values were further compared with the theoretical ones obtained by using a previously published methodology M&amp;M. 4 different designs of direct-to-implant dental restorations from the manufacturer BTI were tested. Forty-eight fatigue tests were performed in an axial fatigue testing machine according to ISO 14801. Linear regression models, 95% interval confidence bands for the linear regression, and 95% prediction intervals of the fatigue load-life results were obtained and compared through an analysis of covariance to determine the influence of the 3 parameters under study on the fatigue behavior Results. Linear regression models showed a statistical difference when the implant body diameter was increased by 1 mm; an average 3.5-fold increase in fatigue life was observed. Increasing the implant abutment connection diameter by 1.4 mm also showed a significant difference, leading to 7-fold longer fatigue life on average. No significant statistical evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in fatigue life between internal and external connections Conclusions. Increasing the implant platform and body diameter significantly improved the fatigue life of the screw, whereas external and internal connections provided similar results. In addition, experimental results proved the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction methodology</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in 3GPP standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks. The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. In this article, we first introduce three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, e.g., cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Then, key technical challenges that severely influence the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed subsequently. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Distributed Feedback Optimizing Control Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of steady-state real-time optimization (RTO) of interconnected systems with a common constraint that couples several units, for example, a shared resource. Such problems are often studied under the context of distributed optimization, where decisions are made locally in each subsystem, and are coordinated to optimize the overall performance. Here, we use distributed feedback-optimizing control framework, where the local systems and the coordinator problems are converted into feedback control problems. This is a powerful scheme that allows us to design feedback control loops, and estimate parameters locally, as well as provide local fast response, allowing different closed-loop time constants for each local subsystem. This paper provides a comparative study of different distributed feedback optimizing control architectures using two case studies. The first case study considers the problem of demand response in a residential energy hub powered by a common renewable energy source, and compares the different feedback optimizing control approaches using simulations. The second case study experimentally validates and compares the different approaches using a lab-scale experimental rig that emulates a subsea oil production network, where the common resource is the gas lift that must be optimally allocated among the wells. %The pros and cons of the different approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Minimax Linear Regulator Problems for Positive Systems</title>

Abstract: Exceptional are the instances where explicit solutions to optimal control problems are obtainable. Of particular interest are the explicit solutions derived for minimax problems, which provide a framework for tackling challenges characterized by adversarial conditions and uncertainties. This work builds on recent discrete-time research, extending it to a multi-disturbance minimax linear framework for linear time-invariant systems in continuous time. Disturbances are considered to be bounded by elementwise linear constraints, along with unconstrained positive disturbances. Dynamic programming theory is applied to derive explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for both finite and infinite horizons. For the infinite horizon a fixed-point method is proposed to compute the solution of the HJB equation. Moreover, the Linear Regulator (LR) problem is introduced, which, analogous to the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem, can be utilized for the stabilization of positive systems. A linear program formulation for the LR problem is proposed which computes the associated stabilizing controller, it it exists. Additionally necessary and sufficient conditions for minimizing the $l_1$-induced gain of the system are derived and characterized through the disturbance penalty of the cost function of the minimax problem class. We motivate the prospective scalability properties of our framework with a large-scale water management network.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Performance Optimization of Model Predictive Control with Robustness Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model mismatch and process noise are two frequently occurring phenomena that can drastically affect the performance of model predictive control (MPC) in practical applications. We propose a principled way to tune the cost function and the constraints of linear MPC schemes to improve the closed-loop performance and robust constraint satisfaction on uncertain nonlinear dynamics with additive noise. The tuning is performed using a novel MPC tuning algorithm based on backpropagation developed in our earlier work. Using the scenario approach, we provide probabilistic bounds on the likelihood of closed-loop constraint violation over a finite horizon. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method on linear and nonlinear simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal cooperative control Method of Highway Ramp Merge Based on Vehicle-road Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merging area of highway ramps faces multiple challenges, including traffic congestion, collision risks, speed mismatches, driver behavior uncertainties, limited visibility, and bottleneck effects. However, autonomous vehicles engaging in depth coordination between vehicle and road in merging zones, by pre-planning and uploading travel trajectories, can significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of merging zones.In this paper,we mainly introduce mainline priority cooperation method to achieve the time and space cooperative control of highway merge.Vehicle-mounted intelligent units share real-time vehicle status and driving intentions with Road Section Management Units, which pre-plan the spatiotemporal trajectories of vehicle travel. After receiving these trajectories, Vehicle Intelligent Units strictly adhere to them. Through this deep collaboration between vehicles and roads, conflicts in time and space during vehicle travel are eliminated in advance.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Prediction and Risk Management of Distribution System Voltages with Non-Gaussian Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High renewable energy penetration into power distribution systems causes a substantial risk of exceeding voltage security limits, which needs to be accurately assessed and properly managed. However, the existing methods usually rely on the joint probability models of power generation and loads provided by probabilistic prediction to quantify the voltage risks, where inaccurate prediction results could lead to over or under estimated risks. This paper proposes an uncertain voltage component (UVC) prediction method for assessing and managing voltage risks. First, we define the UVC to evaluate voltage variations caused by the uncertainties associated with power generation and loads. Second, we propose a Gaussian mixture model-based probabilistic UVC prediction method to depict the non-Gaussian distribution of voltage variations. Then, we derive the voltage risk indices, including value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), based on the probabilistic UVC prediction model. Third, we investigate the mechanism of UVC-based voltage risk management and establish the voltage risk management problems, which are reformulated into linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming for convenient solutions. The proposed method is tested on power distribution systems with actual photovoltaic power and load data and compared with those considering probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections. Numerical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient in assessing voltage risks and outperforms existing methods in managing voltage risks. The deviation of voltage risks obtained by the proposed method is only 15% of that by the methods based on probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections.</description>

      <title>Robustness to Model Approximation, Empirical Model Learning, and Sample Complexity in Wasserstein Regular MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies the robustness properties of discrete-time stochastic optimal control under Wasserstein model approximation for both discounted cost and average cost criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate it to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernels. A primary motivation of this analysis is empirical model learning, as well as empirical noise distribution learning, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criteria, such as total variation, may not. We discuss applications of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds are given, and also to a general empirical model learning approach, obtained under either Markov or i.i.d.~learning settings. Further applications regarding the continuity of invariant probability measures with respect to transition kernels are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Recovery of Sparse Graph Signals from Graph Filter Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recovery of a node-domain sparse graph signal from the output of a graph filter. This problem, which is often referred to as the identification of the source of a diffused sparse graph signal, is seminal in the field of graph signal processing (GSP). Sparse graph signals can be used in the modeling of a variety of real-world applications in networks, such as social, biological, and power systems, and enable various GSP tasks, such as graph signal reconstruction, blind deconvolution, and sampling. In this paper, we assume double sparsity of both the graph signal and the graph topology, as well as a low-order graph filter. We propose three algorithms to reconstruct the support set of the input sparse graph signal from the graph filter output samples, leveraging these assumptions and the generalized information criterion (GIC). First, we describe the graph multiple GIC (GM-GIC) method, which is based on partitioning the dictionary elements (graph filter matrix columns) that capture information on the signal into smaller subsets. Then, the local GICs are computed for each subset and aggregated to make a global decision. Second, inspired by the well-known branch and bound (BNB) approach, we develop the graph-based branch and bound GIC (graph-BNB-GIC), and incorporate a new tractable heuristic bound tailored to the graph and graph filter characteristics. In addition, we propose the graph-based first order correction (GFOC) method, which improves existing sparse recovery methods by iteratively examining potential improvements to the GIC cost function by replacing elements from the estimated support set with elements from their one-hop neighborhood. In addition, we investigate the application of our graph-based sparse recovery methods in blind deconvolution scenarios where the graph filter is unknown.</description>

      <title>WoCoCo: Learning Whole-Body Humanoid Control with Sequential Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid activities involving sequential contacts are crucial for complex robotic interactions and operations in the real world and are traditionally solved by model-based motion planning, which is time-consuming and often relies on simplified dynamics models. Although model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for versatile and robust whole-body humanoid control, it still requires tedious task-specific tuning and state machine design and suffers from long-horizon exploration issues in tasks involving contact sequences. In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors: 1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Adaptation-Based Control for Track Stand of Single-Track Two-Wheeled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary balance control is challenging for single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots due to the lack of elegant balancing mechanisms and the conflict between the limited attraction domain and external disturbances. To address the absence of balancing mechanisms, we draw inspiration from cyclists and leverage the track stand maneuver, which relies solely on steering and rear-wheel actuation. To achieve accurate tracking in the presence of matched and mismatched disturbances, we propose an equilibrium adaptation-based control (EABC) scheme that can be seamlessly integrated with standard disturbance observers and controllers. This scheme enables adaptation to slow-varying disturbances by utilizing a disturbed equilibrium estimator, effectively handling both matched and mismatched disturbances in a unified manner while ensuring accurate tracking with zero steady-state error. We integrate the EABC scheme with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) for the track stand of STTW robots and validate its effectiveness through two experimental scenarios. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy, reducing errors by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Dynamic Neural Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent applications beyond the network edge, coupled with the need for sustainable operation, are driving the seamless integration of deep learning (DL) algorithms into energy-limited, and even energy-harvesting end-devices. However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy sources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the energy requirements for inference and causing significant performance degradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an on-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and finite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time execution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural networks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier predictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be employed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy storage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of integrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We derive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and -agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the advantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a lightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show that, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware control schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their energy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve even higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited relative to the energy consumption of the inference model.</description>
