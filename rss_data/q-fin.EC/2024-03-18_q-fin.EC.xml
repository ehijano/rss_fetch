      <title>Prediction of retail chain failure: examples of recent U.S. retail failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last several years, several well-established and prominent brick-and-mortar retail chains have ceased operations, raising concerns for something that some have referred to as a retail apocalypse. While the demise of brick-and-mortar is far from certain, scholars have attempted to model the likelihood that a retailer is about to fail using different approaches. This paper examines the failures of Bed Bath and Beyond, J.C. Penney, Rite Aid, and Sears Holdings in the United States between 2013 and 2022. A model of retail failure is presented that considers internal and external firm factors using both annual report and macroeconomic data. The findings suggest that certain revenue-based financial ratios and the annual average U.S. inflation rates are statistically significant predictors of failure. Furthermore, the failure model demonstrated that it can provide a nontrivial early warning signal at least the year before failure. The paper concludes with a discussion and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for the Decumulation of Retirement Savings under Differing Appetites for Liquidity and Investment Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A retiree's appetite for risk is a common input into the lifetime utility models that are traditionally used to find optimal strategies for the decumulation of retirement savings.
  In this work, we consider a retiree with potentially differing appetites for the key financial risks of decumulation: liquidity risk and investment risk. We set out to determine whether these differing risk appetites have a significant impact on the retiree's optimal choice of decumulation strategy. To do so, we design and implement a framework which selects the optimal decumulation strategy from a general set of admissible strategies in line with a retiree's goals, and under differing appetites for the key risks of decumulation.
  Overall, we find significant evidence to suggest that a retiree's differing appetites for different decumulation risks will impact their optimal choice of strategy at retirement. Through an illustrative example calibrated to the Australian context, we find results which are consistent with actual behaviours in this jurisdiction (in particular, a shallow market for annuities), which lends support to our framework and may provide some new insight into the so-called annuity puzzle.</description>

      <title>Global Shipyard Capacities Limiting the Ramp-Up of Global Hydrogen-based Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the global energy system requires significant expansions of renewable energy technologies. Given that cost-effective renewable sources are not necessarily situated in proximity to the largest energy demand centers globally, the maritime transportation of low-carbon energy carriers, such as renewable-based hydrogen or ammonia, will be needed. However, whether existent shipyards possess the required capacity to provide the necessary global fleet has not yet been answered. Therefore, this study estimates global tanker demand based on projections for global hydrogen demand, while comparing these projections with historic shipyard production. Our findings reveal a potential bottleneck until 2033-2039 if relying on liquefied hydrogen exclusively. This bottleneck could be circumvented by increasing local hydrogen production, utilizing pipelines, or liquefied ammonia as an energy carrier for hydrogen. Furthermore, the regional concentration of shipyard locations raises concerns about diversification. Increasing demand for container vessels could substantially hinder the scale-up of maritime hydrogen transport.</description>

      <title>Restricting Entries to All-Pay Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an all-pay contest where players with low abilities are filtered prior to the round of competing for prizes. These are often practiced due to limited resources or to enhance the competitiveness of the contest. We consider a setting where the designer admits a certain number of top players into the contest. The players admitted into the contest update their beliefs about their opponents based on the signal that their abilities are among the top. We find that their posterior beliefs, even with IID priors, are correlated and depend on players' private abilities, representing a unique feature of this game. We explicitly characterize the symmetric and unique Bayesian equilibrium strategy. We find that each admitted player's equilibrium effort is in general not monotone with the number of admitted players. Despite this non-monotonicity, surprisingly, all players exert their highest efforts when all players are admitted. This result holds generally -- it is true under any ranking-based prize structure, ability distribution, and cost function. We also discuss a two-stage extension where players with top first-stage efforts can proceed to the second stage competing for prizes.</description>
