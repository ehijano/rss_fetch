      <title>Estimation of the tidal heating in the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Influence of the internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io's heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth's geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.</description>

      <title>Protonic thermoelectric effect of Superionic H2O and magnetic field generation in Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are characterized by anomalously tilted and multi-dipole magnetic fields, which poses substantial challenges for elucidating the internal mechanisms generating magnetic fields. Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Disc fragmentation. II. Ejection of low mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic "pincer movement" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\sim 10$\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter.</description>

      <title>The uncertainty in water mass fraction of wet planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Broadband spectroscopy of astrophysical ice analogues: IV. Optical constants of N$_2$ ice in the terahertz and mid-infrared ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.
  Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.
  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.
  Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal.
  Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Formation of multi-planetary systems via pebble accretion in externally photoevaporating discs in stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (&gt; 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the dynamics and origin of the NEA pair 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the association between the NEAs 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1, which share similar heliocentric Keplerian elements and the same taxonomic classification. First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair's orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus' atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Two-source terrestrial planet formation with a sweeping secular resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.</description>

      <title>Secular Excitation of Polar Neptune Orbits in Pure Disk-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar spin-orbit angles of Neptune-sized planets present a primordial yet puzzling view of the planetary formation epoch. The striking dichotomy of aligned and perpendicular orbital configurations are suggestive of obliquity excitation through secular resonance -- a process where the precession of a hot Neptune becomes locked onto a forcing frequency, and is slowly guided into a perpendicular state. Previous models of resonant capture have involved the presence of companion perturbers to the star-planet-disk system, but in most cases, such companions are not confirmed to be present. In this work, we present a mechanism for exciting Neptunes to polar orbits in systems without giant perturbers, where photo-evaporation is the self-contained mechanism. Photo-evaporation opens a gap in the protoplanetary disk at ~1 au, and the inner disk continues to viscously accrete onto the host star, precessing quickly due to the perturbation of the outer disk. As the inner disk shrinks, it precesses more slowly, and encounters a resonance with the J2 precession of the Neptune, quickly exciting it to a polar configuration. While likely not applicable to more massive planets which trigger back-reactions onto the disk, this mechanism reproduces the obliquities of small planets in multiple respects.</description>

      <title>The SOL $\textit{(Solar Origin and Life)}$ Project: Detailed characterization of candidates for the ZAMS and Subgiant stages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The context of the Sun in the galactic neighborhood is not well understood, especially when we compare its physical properties to those of nearby stars. Thereby, we still cannot fully comprehend whether or not the Sun is a typical star. This work aims to identify and characterize stars aligned with the solar evolutionary track that could represent it at the ZAMS and subgiant stages. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of 18 photometrically selected candidates using high-resolution and high-SNR spectra as well as the classical spectroscopic method, based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of Fe I and Fe II lines. Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\&amp;$ K and H$\alpha$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth's atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments.</description>

      <title>Perhaps there is no brown dwarf desert? A study of sub-stellar companions with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brown dwarf desert describes a range of orbital periods (&lt;5 years) in which fewer brown dwarf-mass companions have been observed around Sun-like stars, when compared to planets and low mass stellar companions. It is therefore theorised that brown dwarf companions are unlikely to form or remain in this period range. The Gaia space telescope is uniquely sensitive to companions in this period range, making it an ideal tool to conduct a survey of the brown dwarf desert. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to analyse data from nearby (&lt;200pc) Sun-like stars in Gaia's DR3 catalogue, assuming single companions. From this, we identify 2673 systems (2.41% of the sample) with possible brown dwarf companions in this period range. Accounting for observational biases, we find that 10.4+0.8-0.6% of nearby Sun-like stars have astrometric errors consistent with a brown dwarf-mass companion with a period less than 5 years, significantly higher than previous studies which reported occurrence rates of &lt;1%. However, we acknowledge the limitations of DR3 and are unable to make a definitive statement without epoch data. By simulating epoch data with multiple companions, we find that, while some of the data can be explained by multiple low-mass brown dwarf companions and high-mass planets (&gt;10MJ), high-mass brown dwarfs (&gt;50MJ) in this period range are comparatively rare. Finally, we used our studies of the brown dwarf distribution to predict the number of companions in the brown dwarf desert we can expect to discover in DR4.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the dust distribution and polarization around two B213 young stellar objects with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms.
  K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (&lt; 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope.
  Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solutions for Planet-Scattering Small Bodies</title>

Abstract: Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we use {\"O}pik's close-encounter framework to study the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\bm{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).</description>

      <title>Water vapor emission at the warm cavity wall of the HD 100546 disk as revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</description>

      <title>Not Just Gas: How Solid-Driven Torques Shaped the Migration of the Galilean Moons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surviving rapid inward orbital migration is a crucial aspect of formation models for the Jupiter's Galilean moons. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Physical Vetting of the Ultra-Short-Period Sub-Earth TOI 864.01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of TOI 864.01, a transit-like signal associated with the M-dwarf TIC 231728511. Utilizing the full baseline of TESS photometry (54 sectors), we recover a periodic signal with $P = 0.52067$ d and a shallow depth of $\sim$158 ppm. To assess the planetary nature of the candidate, we performed a rigorous vetting process combining centroid analysis, Bayesian model comparison, and false-positive probability calculations. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the sub-Earth candidate yielded inconclusive formal statistical validation metrics (FPP) and Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln Z$), we demonstrate the planetary nature of the system through physical exclusion of false positive scenarios. The TRICERATOPS Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of 0.0000, combined with centroid stability, rules out background contamination. Furthermore, we calculate that a stellar-mass companion at the derived orbital separation ($a \approx 5 R_\star$) would induce ellipsoidal variations of order $\gtrsim 5000$ ppm. The absence of such variations in the TESS photometry ($&lt; 200$ ppm limit) physically precludes stellar binary scenarios. We derive a planetary radius of $R_p \approx 0.55 R_\oplus$, confirming TOI 864.01 as a physically vetted ultra-short-period sub-Earth.</description>

      <title>Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7M$_{\odot}$ star (circumstellar model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the circumstellar model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (circumbinary fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (circumbinary realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17-0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Radio Emission from the K2-18 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</description>
