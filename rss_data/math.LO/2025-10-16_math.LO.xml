      <title>Decidability of Being a Union-splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many logical properties are known to be undecidable for normal modal logics, with few exceptions such as consistency and coincidence with $\mathsf{K}$. This paper shows that the property of being a union-splitting in $\mathsf{NExt}\mathsf{K}$, the lattice of normal modal logics, is decidable, thus answering the open problem [WZ07, Problem 2]. This is done by providing a semantic characterization of union-splittings in terms of finite modal algebras. Moreover, by clarifying the connection to union-splittings, we show that in $\mathsf{NExt}\mathsf{K}$, having a decidable axiomatization problem and being a (un)decidable formula are also decidable. The latter answers [CZ97, Problem 17.3] for $\mathsf{NExt}\mathsf{K}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide, for any regular uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a new argument for Pincus' result on the consistency of $\ZF$ with the higher dependent choice principle $\DC_{&lt;\kappa}$ and the ordering principle in the presence of a failure of the axiom of choice. We also generalise his methods and obtain these consistency results in a larger class of models.</description>

      <title>Problems and Consequences of Bilateral Notions of (Meta-)Derivability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bilateralist take on proof-theoretic semantics can be understood as demanding of a proof system to display not only rules giving the connectives' provability conditions but also their refutability conditions. On such a view, then, a system with two derivability relations is obtained, which can be quite naturally expressed in a proof system of natural deduction but which faces obstacles in a sequent calculus representation. Since in a sequent calculus there are two derivability relations inherent, one expressed by the sequent sign and one by the horizontal lines holding between sequents, in a truly bilateral calculus both need to be dualized. While dualizing the sequent sign is rather straightforwardly corresponding to dualizing the horizontal lines in natural deduction, dualizing the horizontal lines in sequent calculus, uncovers problems that, as will be argued in this paper, shed light on deeper conceptual issues concerning an imbalance between the notions of proof vs. refutation. The roots of this problem will be further analyzed and possible solutions on how to retain a bilaterally desired balance in our system are presented.</description>

      <title>On Strongly-equitable Social Welfare Orders Without the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social welfare orders seek to combine the disparate preferences of an infinite sequence of generations into a single, societal preference order in some reasonably-equitable way. In [2] Dubey and Laguzzi study a type of social welfare order which they call SEA, for strongly equitable and (finitely) anonymous. They prove that the existence of a SEA order implies the existence of a set of reals which does not have the Baire property, and observe that a nonprincipal ultrafilter over $\mathbb{N}$ can be used to construct a SEA order. Questions arising in their work include whether the existence of a SEA order implies the existence of either a set of real numbers which is not Lebesgue-measurable or of a nonprincipal ultrafilter over $\mathbb{N}$. We answer both these questions, the solution to the second using the techniques of geometric set theory as set out by Larson and Zapletal in [11]. The outcome is that the existence of a SEA order does imply the existence of a set of reals which is not Lebesgue-measurable, and does not imply the existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>From Numbers to Ur-Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine two ways of coding sequences in arithmetical theories. We investigate under what conditions they work. To be more precise, we study the creation of objects of a data-type that we call ur-strings, roughly sequences where the components are ordered but where we do not have an explicitly given projection function.
  First, we have a brief look at the beta-function which was already carefully studied by Emil Je\v{r}\'abek. We study in detail our two target constructions. These constructions both employ theories of strings. The first is based on Smullyan coding and the second on the representation of binary strings in the special linear monoid of the non-negative part of discretely ordered commutative rings as introduced by Markov. We use the Markov coding to obtain an alternative proof that ${\sf PA}^{-}$ is sequential.</description>

Abstract: We construct an expansion of a real closed field by a multiplicative subgroup adapting Poizat's theory of green points. Its theory is strongly dependent, and every open set definable in a model of this theory is semialgebraic. We prove that the real field with a dense family of logarithmic spirals, proposed by Zilber, satisfies our theory.</description>

Abstract: We present a formalization of Borel determinacy in the Lean 4 theorem prover.

      <title>On the spectrum of limit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of limit models assuming the existence of a nicely behaved independence notion. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that all `long' limit models are isomorphic, and all `short' limit models are non-isomorphic.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $\mathbf{K}$ be a $\aleph_0$-tame abstract elementary class stable in $\lambda \geq \operatorname{LS}(\mathbf{K})$ with amalgamation, joint embedding and no maximal models. Suppose there is an independence relation on the models of size $\lambda$ that satisfies uniqueness, extension, non-forking amalgamation, universal continuity, and $(\geq \kappa)$-local character in a minimal regular $\kappa &lt; \lambda^+$.
  Suppose $\delta_1, \delta_2 &lt; \lambda^+$ with $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) &lt; \operatorname{cf}(\delta_2)$. Then for any $N_1, N_2, M \in \mathbf{K}_\lambda$ where $N_l$ is a $(\lambda, \delta_l)$-limit model over $M$ for $l = 1, 2$,
  \[N_1 \text{ is isomorphic to } N_2 \text{ over } M \iff \operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) \geq \kappa\]
  Both implications in the conclusion have improvements. High cofinality limits are isomorphic without the $\aleph_0$-tameness assumption and assuming the independence relation is defined only on high cofinality limit models. Low cofinality limits are non-isomorphic without assuming non-forking amalgamation.
  We show how our results can be used to study limit models in both abstract settings and in natural examples of abstract elementary classes.</description>

      <title>Cubic Incompleteness: Hilbert's Tenth Problem Over $\mathbb{N}$ Starts at $\delta=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Hilbert's Tenth Problem over $\mathbb{N}$ remains undecidable when restricted to cubic equations (degree $\leq 3$), resolving the open case $\delta = 3$ identified by Jones (1982) and establishing sharpness against the decidability barrier at $\delta = 2$ (Lagrange's four-square theorem). For any consistent, recursively axiomatizable theory $T$ with G\"odel sentence $G_T$, we effectively construct a single polynomial $P(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \in \mathbb{Z}[\mathbf{x}]$ of degree $\leq 3$ such that $T \vdash G_T$ if and only if $\exists \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{N}^m : P(\mathbf{x}) = 0$.
  Our reduction proceeds through four stages with explicit degree and variable accounting. First, proof-sequence encoding via Diophantine $\beta$-function and Zeckendorf representation yields $O(KN)$ quadratic constraints, where $K = O(\log(\max_i f_i))$ and $N$ is the proof length. Second, axiom--modus ponens verification is implemented via guard-gadgets wrapping each base constraint $E(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ into the system $u \cdot E(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, $u - 1 - v^2 = 0$, maintaining degree $\leq 3$ while introducing $O(KN^3)$ variables and equations. Third, system aggregation via sum-of-squares merger $P_{\text{merged}} = \sum_{i} P_i^2$ produces a single polynomial of degree $\leq 6$ with $O(KN^3)$ monomials. Fourth, recursive monomial shielding factors each monomial of degree exceeding $3$ in $O(\log d)$ rounds via auxiliary variables and degree-$\leq 3$ equations, adding $O(K^3 N^3)$ variables and restoring degree $\leq 3$. We provide bookkeeping for every guard-gadget and merging operation, plus a unified stage-by-stage variable-count table. Our construction is effective and non-uniform in the uncomputable proof length $N$, avoiding any universal cubic equation. This completes the proof that the class of cubic Diophantine equations over $\mathbb{N}$ is undecidable.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two-cardinal Kurepa Hypothesis $\mathsf{KH}(\kappa,\lambda)$. We observe that if $\kappa\leq\lambda&lt;\mu$ are infinite cardinals then $\lnot\mathsf{KH}(\kappa,\lambda)\land\mathsf{KH}(\kappa,\mu)\rightarrow\mathsf{KH}(\lambda^+,\mu)$, and show that in some sense this is the only $\mathsf{ZFC}$ constraint. The case of singular $\lambda$ and its relation to Chang's Conjecture and scales is discussed. We also extend an independence result about Kurepa and Aronszajn trees due to Cummings to the case of successors of singular cardinal.</description>

      <title>Higher-order generalizations of stability and arithmetic regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01739v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a natural notion of higher order stability and show that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ that are tame in this sense can be approximately described by a union of low-complexity quadratic varieties, up to linear error. This generalizes the arithmetic regularity lemma for stable subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, proved in earlier work of the authors, to the realm of higher-order Fourier analysis.
  This result is strictly stronger than the structure theorem for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, first proved by the authors in earlier versions of this paper and now available as a separate manuscript arXiv:2510.12867. Taken together, these results provide group theoretic analogues of results obtained for 3-uniform hypergraphs in arXiv:2111.01737.</description>

      <title>Simply-typed constant-domain modal lambda calculus I: distanced beta reduction and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed that combines modal logic and simply-typed lambda calculus, and that generalizes the system studied by Montague and Gallin. Whereas Montague and Gallin worked with Church's simple theory of types, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed in the typed base theory most commonly used today, namely the simply-typed lambda calculus. Further, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is controlled by a parameter $\theta$ which allows more options for state types and state variables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is to establish the basic metatheory of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$: (i) a completeness theorem is proven for $\beta\eta$-reduction, and (ii) an Andrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is given; and this involves, with some necessity, a distanced version of $\beta$-reduction and a $\mathsf{BCKW}$-like basis rather than $\mathsf{SKI}$-like basis. Further, conservation of the maximal system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ over $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven, and expressibility of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ in $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven; thus these modal logics are highly expressive. Similar results are proven for the relation between $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol\lambda$, the corresponding ordinary simply-typed lambda calculus. This answers a question of Zimmermann in the simply-typed setting. In a companion paper this is extended to Church's simple theory of types.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic complexity of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In prior work, we showed that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ are well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$, where the complexity $\ell$ of the linear part and the complexity $q$ of the quadratic part are both bounded in terms of $k$, $p$, and the desired level of approximation $\mu$. A key tool in the proof of this result was an arithmetic regularity lemma for the Gowers $U^3$-norm by Green and Tao, which resulted in tower-type bounds (in terms of $\mu^{-1}$) on both $\ell$ and $q$.
  In the present paper we show that for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, the bound on $q$ can be substantially improved. Specifically, we will prove that any set $A\subseteq G=\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension at most $k$ is approximately equal (up to error $\mu |G|$) to a union of atoms of a quadratic factor whose quadratic complexity is at most $\log_p(\mu^{-k-o(1)})$, implying that the purely quadratic component of the factor partitions the group into $\mu^{-k-o(1)}$ many parts.
  We achieve this by using our earlier result to obtain an initial quadratic factor $\mathcal{B}$, and then applying a generalization of an argument of Alon, Fox and Zhao for subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension to the label space (also known as "configuration space") of $\mathcal{B}$. A related strategy was employed in earlier work of the authors on $\mathrm{NFOP}_2$ subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, and in work of the first author in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that a subset of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ is well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$ (denoting the complexities of the linear and quadratic part, respectively), where $\ell$ and $q$ are bounded by a constant depending only on $k$ and the desired level of approximation. This generalises a result of Alon, Fox and Zhao on the structure of sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension, and is analogous to contemporaneous work of the authors arXiv:2111.01737 in the setting of 3-uniform hypergraphs.
  The main result originally appeared--albeit with a different proof--in a 2021 preprint arXiv:2111.01739, which has since been split into two: the present work, which focuses on higher arity NIP and develops a theory of local uniformity semi-norms of possibly independent interest, and its companion arXiv:2111.01739, which strengthens these results under a generalized notion of stability.</description>
