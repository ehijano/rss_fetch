      <title>Left-handedness with three zero-absorption windows tuned by the incoherent pumping field and inter-dot tunnelings in a GaAs/AlGaAs triple quantum dots system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left-handedness with three zero-absorption windows is achieved in a triple-quantum dot (TQD) system. With the typical parameters of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, the simultaneous negative relative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are obtained by the adjustable incoherent pumping field and two inter-dot tunnelings. What's more, three zero-absorption windows in the left-handedness frequency bands are observed in the TQD system. The left-handedness with zero-absorption in solid state heterostructure may solve not only the challenge in the photonic resonant scheme for left-handed materials (LHMs) but also the application limitation of the negative refractive materials with large amount of absorption.</description>

      <title>Effect of Spontaneously Generated Coherence and Detuning on 2D Atom Localization in Two Orthogonal Standing-Wave Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) atom localization via the spontaneously generated coherence (SGC) and detunings associated with the probe and standing-wave driving fields in a three-level V-type atomic system are investigated. In the gain process, two equal and tunable peak maxima of position distribution in the plane via the detunings are observed. However, one decreasing and the other increasing peak maxima in the absorption process via the SGC are achieved in the quadrants I and III of the x-y plane. A better resolution and more novelty for the 2D atom localization in our scheme are obtained.</description>

      <title>2-D isotropic negative refractive index in a N-type four-level atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2-D(Two-dimensional) isotropic negative refractive index (NRI) is explicitly realized via the orthogonal signal and coupling standing-wave fields coupling the N-type four-level atomic system. Under some key parameters of the dense vapor media, the atomic system exhibits isotropic NRI with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability (i.e. Left-handedness) in the 2-D x-y plane. Compared with other 2-D NRI schemes, the coherent atomic vapor media in our scheme may be an ideal 2-D isotropic NRI candidate and has some potential advantages, significance or applications in the further investigation.</description>

      <title>Current and efficiency of bosonic systems interacting with two thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of current and efficiency in a bosonic system consisting of a central system interacting with two reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive a master equation describing the time evolution of the density matrix of the system, accounting for the interactions and energy transfer between the components. We quantify the current, representing the flow of bosons through the system and analyse its dependence on the system's parameters and temperatures of the thermal reservoirs. In the steady state regime, we derived an expression for the efficiency of the energy transfer process. Our analysis show that quantum effects, such as the dependence on temperature and the quantum correction factor, can significantly impact energy transfer efficiency. In particular, we observe that at high temperatures, the efficiency of the quantum system is greater than the Carnot efficiency. The insights gained from this analysis may have implications in various fields, including quantum computing and energy harvesting, where optimising energy utilisation is crucial.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford topological fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

      <title>Exact counterdiabatic driving for finite topological lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic protocols are often employed in state preparation schemes but require the system to be driven by a slowly varying Hamiltonian so that transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially suppressed. Counterdiabatic driving is a technique to speed up adiabatic protocols by including additional terms calculated from the instantaneous eigenstates that counter diabatic excitations. However, this approach requires knowledge of the full eigenspectrum meaning that the exact analytical form of counterdiabatic driving is only known for a subset of problems, e.g., the harmonic oscillator and transverse field Ising model. We extend this subset of problems to include the general family of one-dimensional non-interacting lattice models with open boundary conditions and arbitrary on-site potential, tunnelling terms, and lattice size. We formulate this approach for all states of lattice models, including bound and in-gap states which appear, e.g., in topological insulators. We also derive targeted counterdiabatic driving terms which are tailored to enforce the dynamical state to remain in a specific state. As an example, we consider state transfer using the topological edge states of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The derived analytical counterdiabatic driving Hamiltonian can be utilised to inform control protocols in many-body lattice models or to probe the non-equilibrium properties of lattice models.</description>

      <title>The effect of niobium thin film structure on losses in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting microwave circuits is strongly influenced by the material properties of the superconducting film and substrate. While progress has been made in understanding the importance of surface preparation and the effect of surface oxides, the complex effect of superconductor film structure on microwave losses is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the microwave properties of niobium resonators with different crystalline properties and related surface topographies. We analyze a series of magnetron sputtered films in which the Nb crystal orientation and surface topography are changed by varying the substrate temperatures between room temperature and 975 K. The lowest-loss resonators that we measure have quality factors of over one million at single-photon powers, among the best ever recorded using the Nb on sapphire platform. We observe the highest quality factors in films grown at an intermediate temperature regime of the growth series (550 K) where the films display both preferential ordering of the crystal domains and low surface roughness. Furthermore, we analyze the temperature-dependent behavior of our resonators to learn about how the quasiparticle density in the Nb film is affected by the niobium crystal structure and the presence of grain boundaries. Our results stress the connection between the crystal structure of superconducting films and the loss mechanisms suffered by the resonators and demonstrate that even a moderate change in temperature during thin film deposition can significantly affect the resulting quality factors.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Rabi splitting as a manifestation of virtual two-mode squeezing: Extracting the squeezing parameters from frequency shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum Rabi splitting relies on symmetrical splitting of the common resonance frequency of atoms and the cavity in which the atoms reside. In this work, we argue that vacuum Rabi splitting is a manifestation of virtual light-matter two-mode squeezing. We establish a connection between squeezing parameters of virtual excitations and frequency shifts of the physical modes. To this end, we use the mapping between the Dicke model and two interacting harmonic oscillators, which we analyze in the framework of bare and physical modes. Finally, we suggest that such virtual squeezing of quantum fields might also play a role in quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a realistic waveguide implementation of a quantum network that serves as a testbed to show how to maximize the storage and manipulation of quantum information in QED setups. We analyze two approaches using wavepacket engineering and quantum state transfer protocols. First, we propose and design a family of orthogonal photons in the time domain. These photons allow for a selective interaction with distinct targeted qubits. Yet, mode multiplexing employing resonant nodes is largely spoiled by cross-talk effects. This motivates the second approach, namely, frequency multiplexing. Here we explore the limits of frequency multiplexing through the waveguide, analyzing its capabilities to host and faithfully transmit photons of different frequencies within a given bandwidth. We perform detailed one- and two-photon simulations and provide theoretical bounds for the fidelity of coherent quantum state transfer protocols under realistic conditions. Our results show that state-of-the-art experiments can employ dozens of multiplexed photons with global fidelities fulfilling the requirements imposed by fault-tolerant quantum computing. This is with the caveat that the conditions for single-photon fidelity are met.</description>

      <title>Sonification of Wigner functions: case study of intense light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the Wigner function $\rho_W(\textbf{r},\textbf{p})$ serves as a phase-space representation, capturing information about both the position $\textbf{r}$ and momentum $\textbf{p}$ of a quantum system. The Wigner function facilitates the calculation of expectation values of observables, examination of quantum system dynamics, and analysis of coherence and correlations. Therefore, it might serve as a tool to express quantum systems intuitively, for example, by using sonification techniques. This paper summarizes the experimental strategies employed in a previous project and delineates a new approach based on its outcomes. Emphasizing the attribution of specific Wigner functions to their underlying quantum states, dynamics, and sources; our proposed methodology seeks to refine the sonification and scoring process, aiming to enhance intuitive understanding and interpretation of quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Photon statistics analysis of h-BN quantum emitters with pulsed and continuous-wave excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the quantum photon statistics of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) quantum emitters by analyzing the Mandel Q parameter. We have measured the Mandel Q parameter for h-BN quantum emitters under various temperatures and pump power excitation conditions. Under pulsed excitation we can achieve a Mandel Q of -0.002 and under continuous-wave (CW) excitation this parameter can reach -0.0025. We investigate the effect of cryogenic temperatures on Mandel Q and conclude that the photon statistics vary weakly with temperature. Through calculation of spontaneous emission from an excited two-level emitter model, we demonstrate good agreement between measured and calculated Mandel Q parameter when accounting for the experimental photon collection efficiency. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of Mandel Q in quantum applications by the example of random number generation and analyze the effect of Mandel Q on the speed of generating random bits via this method.</description>

      <title>Tangent space generators of matrix product states and exact Floquet quantum scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Practical ultra-low frequency noise laser system for quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laser's frequency noise is crucial to the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Two commonly used methods to suppress the laser's frequency noise are locking the laser to an atomic transition by the lock-in technique or to an ultra-low thermal expansion (ULE) glass cavity by the PDH technique. The former cannot suppress rapidly changing frequency noise and hardly meets the needs; the latter has powerful performance but a heightened cost. The lack of high-performance and low-cost laser noise suppression methods dramatically limits the practical application of quantum sensors. This work demonstrates that, in many quantum sensing applications such as the Rydberg atomic superheterodyne receiver, by cascade locking the laser to both the atomic transition and a low-cost (LC) cavity, the same performance as locking to the ULE cavity can be achieved. This work is significant in promoting the practical application of quantum sensors.</description>

Abstract: We propose a construction of kinetically constrained models using the Markovian quantum dynamics under strong dissipation. Using the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism, we show that strong dissipation leads to the emergent decoherence-free subspaces, within which constrained quantum many-body unitary dynamics can take place. We argue that the unitary dynamics constructed by the GKSL dynamics is more tightly constrained than that constructed by the strongly interacting Hamiltonian, where the interactions have the same form with the GKSL jump operators. As an example, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin system with two-site dissipation leads to the kinetically constrained ``PXQ" model, which exhibits the free domain-wall motion with an additional frozen-block structure. Under the uniform magnetic field, the PXQ model shows the domain-wall localization, similar to the Wannier-Stark localization. We then couple two PXQ chains with the magnetic field and inter-chain interaction. We discover that, while localization of the domain walls persists despite the interactions for typical parameter regimes, a non-trivial partial delocalization appears for a certain parameter line.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging an algebraic approach built on minimal realizations and conditional expectations in quantum probability, we propose a method to reduce the dimension of quantum filters while maintaining the correct distributions on the outcomes of interest. The method is presented for general quantum systems whose dynamics depend on measurement outcomes, hinges on a system-theoretic observability analysis, and is tested on prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Integrated distributed sensing and quantum communication networks</title>

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication can achieve ubiquitous sensing while enabling ubiquitous communication. Within the gradually improving global communication, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on optical fibers can accomplish various functionalities, such as urban structure imaging, seismic wave detection, and pipeline safety monitoring. With the development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard quantum limit. CV-QKD protocol and the round-trip multi-band structure are adopted to achieve the multi-node secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the spectrum phase monitoring (SPM) protocol is proposed to realize distributed sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multi-user quantum network can achieve a secret key rate (SKR) of approximately 0.7 $\rm{Mbits/s}$ for each user under 10 $\rm{km}$ standard fiber transmission and its network capacity is 8. In terms of distributed sensing, it can achieve a vibration response bandwidth ranging from 1 $\rm{Hz}$ to 2 $\rm{kHz}$, a strain resolution of 0.50 $\rm{n}$$\varepsilon$$/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and a spatial resolution of 0.20 $\rm{m}$ under shot-noise-limited detection. The proposed ISAQN scheme enables simultaneous quantum communication and distributed sensing in a multi-point network, laying a foundation for future large-scale quantum networks and high-precision sensing networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient thermalization and universal quantum computing with quantum Gibbs samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum simulation. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures, and for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or ``thermofield double'' states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is polynomially equivalent to standard quantum computation. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then analysing it as perturbation of the Hamiltonian corresponding to infinite temperature. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Laplace transform of the energy observable at fixed runtime, and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Average circuit eigenvalue sampling on NISQ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Average circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) was introduced by Flammia in arXiv:2108.05803 as a protocol to characterize the Pauli error channels of individual gates across the device simultaneously. The original paper posed using ACES to characterize near-term devices as an open problem. This work advances in this direction by presenting a full implementation of ACES for real devices and deploying it to Superstaq arXiv:2309.05157, along with a device-tailored resource estimation obtained through simulations and experiments. Our simulations show that ACES is able to estimate one- and two-qubit non-uniform Pauli error channels to an average eigenvalue absolute error of under $0.003$ and total variation distance of under 0.001 between simulated and reconstructed probability distributions over Pauli errors with $10^5$ shots per circuit using 5 circuits of depth 14. The question of estimating general error channels through twirling techniques in real devices remains open, as it is dependent on a device's native gates, but simulations with the Clifford set show results in agreement with reported hardware data. Experimental results on IBM's Algiers and Osaka devices are presented, where we characterize their error channels as Pauli channels without twirling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indistinguishability between photons is a key requirement for scalable photonic quantum technologies. We experimentally demonstrate that partly distinguishable single photons can be purified to reach near-unity indistinguishability by the process of quantum interference with ancillary photons followed by heralded detection of a subset of them. We report on the indistinguishability of the purified photons by interfering two purified photons and show improvements in the photon indistinguishability of $2.774(3)$\% in the low-noise regime, and as high as $10.2(5)$ \% in the high-noise regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quantum information geometry, I derive quantum generalizations of the Onsager rate equations, which model the dynamics of a system near a steady state. By redefining the currents, I propose a version of the equations with a symmetric transport tensor without assuming any detailed balance. With a more conventional definition of the currents, I propose another version where the transport tensor may not be symmetric and detailed balance is a sufficient, though not necessary, condition for the symmetry of the tensor. The relations and relative merits of the two versions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Article we analyze the algebraic properties of the asymptotic dynamics of finite-dimensional open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture. In particular, a natural product (Choi-Effros product) can be defined in the asymptotic regime. Motivated by this structure, we introduce a new space called the Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra. Interestingly, this space is both a C* -algebra with respect to the composition product, and a B* -algebra with respect to the Choi-Effros product. Moreover, such space admits a direct-sum decomposition revealing a clear relationship with the attractor subspace of the dynamics. In particular, the equality between the attractor subspace and the Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra is a necessary and sufficient condition for a faithful dynamics. Finally, we show how all the findings do not rely on complete positivity but on the much weaker Schwarz property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well can the physical transformation on quantum channels be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels by strengthening the monotonicity inequality of quantum relative entropy of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be quantum superchannel analogue of quantum subunital channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic Partial Transpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an imbalance-resolved negativity.</description>

      <title>Wigner-molecule supercrystal in transition-metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices: Lessons from the bottom-up approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The few-body problem for $N=4$ fermionic charge carriers in a double-well moir\'{e} quantum dot (MQD), representing the first step in a bottom-up strategy to investigate formation of molecular supercrystals in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices with integral fillings, $\nu &gt; 1$, is solved exactly by employing large-scale exact-diagonalization via full configuration interaction (FCI) computations. A comparative analysis with the mean-field solutions of the often used spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree Fock (sS-UHF) demonstrates the limitations of the UHF method (by itself) to provide a proper description of the influence of the interdot Coulomb interaction. In particular, it is explicitly shown for $\nu=2$ that the exact charge densities (CDs) within each MQD retain the ring-like shape characteristic (for a wide range of relevant parameters) of a fully isolated MQD, as was found for sliding Wigner molecules (WMs). This deeply quantum-mechanical behavior contrasts sharply with the UHF CDs that portray solely orientationally pinned and well localized dumbbell dimers. An improved CD, which agrees with the FCI-calculated one, derived from the restoration of the sS-UHF broken parity symmetries is further introduced, suggesting a beyond-mean-field methodological roadmap for correcting the sS-UHF results. It is conjectured that the conclusions for the $\nu=2$ moir\'e TMD superlattice case extend to all cases with integral fillings that are associated with sliding WMs in isolated MQDs. The case of $\nu=3$, associated with a pinned WM in isolated MQDs, is an exception.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We introduce a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>

      <title>Bosonic KG-oscillators in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Wu-Yang magnetic monopole and Ricci scalar curvature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bosonic Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a global monopole (GM) spacetime in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity and a Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM). We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly, introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell $-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar curvature settings.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a Bose gas in three dimensions of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range or contact interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. It is known that if one imposes the same kind of boundary condition of the one-body problem with a point interaction then one is inevitably led to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below and therefore unstable. This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes too strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such instability property, we develop a suggestion formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 and introduce a slightly modified boundary condition which reduces the strength of the interaction when the positions of the particles $i, j$ coincide in the following cases: a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; b) two other particles approach to each other. In all the other cases the usual boundary condition is restored. Following a quadratic form approach, we prove that the Hamiltonian characterized by such modified boundary condition is self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also show that the N-body Hamiltonian with contact interactions obtained years ago by Albeverio, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977) is a special case of our Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of ultrafast pulses via spectral inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution limits of classical spectroscopy can be surpassed by quantum-inspired methods leveraging the information contained in the phase of the complex electromagnetic field. Their counterpart in spatial imaging has been widely discussed and demonstrated; however, the spectral-domain implementations are few and scarce. We experimentally demonstrate a spectroscopic super-resolution method aimed at broadband light (10s to 100s of GHz), and based on the spectral-domain analog of image inversion interferometry. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we study the paradigmatic problem of estimating a small separation between two incoherent spectral features of equal brightness, with a small number of photons per coherence time. On the grounds of asymptotic estimation theory, more than a $2$-fold improvement over the spectral direct imaging is demonstrated in terms of required resources (photons) for a given estimator variance. The setup is based on an actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer with electro-optic time lenses and passive spectral dispersers implementing the inversion. As such, the method promises on-chip integration, good scalability, and further applications e.g. for mode sorting.</description>

      <title>Electrical readout of spins in the absence of spin blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout requiring only two bound spins for its implementation which, in conjunction with charge sensing techniques, has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect different spin measurement outcomes selectively and positively. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin selective and positive readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1-8~$\mu$s. Our method should help perform high-fidelity projective spin measurements in systems subject to strong SOC and may facilitate quantum tomography and state leakage studies.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Transverse Laguerre-Gauss Modes in Parametric Down-Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first color photos of the parametric down-conversion (PDC) emission cone illustrate the correlation of longitudinal- and transverse momentum in the process, i.e., wavelength-dependent emission angle of PDC photons. However, current experiments and applications are more conveniently described in terms of discrete mode sets, with the most suitable choice depending on the propagation symmetries of the experimental setting. Remarkably, despite the fact that experiments with PDC sources are becoming ever more demanding, e.g. in terms of brightness or state fidelity, a description of spectral-spatial coupling in parametric downconversion for the case of discrete modal decompositions remains elusive. We present a comprehensive study, in theory and experiment, of the spectral dependence of the transverse Laguerre-Gauss modes in parametric downconversion. Moreover, we show how the spectral and spatial coupling can be harnessed to tune the purity of the well-known orbital angular momentum entanglement. This work has implications for efficient collection of entangled photons in a transverse single mode, quantum imaging, and engineering pure states for high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We study the discrimination of von Neumann measurements in the scenario when we are given a reference measurement and some other measurement. The aim of the discrimination is to determine whether the other measurement is the same as the first one. We consider the cases when the reference measurement is given without the classical description and when its classical description is known. Both cases are studied in the symmetric and asymmetric discrimination setups. Moreover, we provide optimal certification schemes enabling us to certify a known quantum measurement against the unknown one.</description>

Abstract: In a hybrid quantum system composed of two quantum wells placed inside a cavity with a moving end mirror pumped by bichromatic coherent light, we address the formation of squeezed states of a mechanical resonator. The exciton mode and mechanical resonator interact indirectly via microcavity fields. Under the conditions of the generated coupling, we predict squeezing of the mechanical-mode beyond the resolved side-band regime with existing experimental parameters. Finally, we show that the robustness of this squeezing against thermal fluctuations is important for practical applications of such systems.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered arrays of multilevel atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverted atomic ensembles, photon-mediated interactions give rise to Dicke superradiance, a form of many-body decay that results in a rapid release of energy as a photon burst. While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle distance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new opportunities for light-matter interactions as their internal structure allows for trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative interactions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance effectively ``closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as quantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exactly solve a quantum Fermi accelerator model consisting of a time-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions. A Hilbert space for such systems can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by first constructing a time-independent Dyson map and subsequently unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions or by first unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions followed by the construction of a time-dependent Dyson map. In turn this allows to construct time-dependent metric operators from a time-independent metric and two time-dependent unitary maps that freeze the moving boundaries. From the time-dependent energy spectrum, we find the known possibility of oscillatory behavior in the average energy in the PT-regime, whereas in the spontaneously broken PT-regime we observe the new feature of a one-time depletion of the energy. We show that the PT broken regime is mended with moving boundary, equivalently to mending it with a time-dependent Dyson map.</description>

Abstract: With the advancement of quantum technologies, there is a potential threat to traditional encryption systems based on integer factorization. Therefore, developing techniques for accurately measuring the performance of associated quantum algorithms is crucial, as it can provide insights into the practical feasibility from the current perspective. In this chapter, we aim to analyze the time required for integer factorization tasks using Shor's algorithm within a gate-based quantum circuit simulator of the matrix product state type. Additionally, we observe the impact of parameter pre-selection in Shor's algorithm. Specifically, this pre-selection is expected to increase the success rate of integer factorization by reducing the number of iterations and facilitating performance measurement under fixed conditions, thus enabling scalable performance evaluation even on real quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Quantum tomography is a widely applicable method for reconstructing unknown quantum states and processes. However, its applications in quantum technologies usually also require estimating the difference between prepared and target quantum states with reliable confidence intervals. In this work we suggest a computationally efficient and reliable scheme for determining well-justified error bars for quantum tomography. We approximate the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the target state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, by calculating its two moments. We also present a generalization of this approach for quantum process tomography and deriving confidence intervals for affine functions. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols using both simulation and demonstration with the use of a cloud-accessible quantum processor. The obtained results pave the way for the use of the suggested scheme for the complete characterization of quantum systems of various natures.</description>

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena. While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations, their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD) algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.</description>

In the steady-state limit, we show that heat always flows from the measurement apparatus into the qubit regardless of the measured qubit state and derive lower and upper bounds for the heat current between the qubit and the measurement apparatus. Furthermore, we study the transient dynamics of the heat current and the excess heat during the transient regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which serves as a paradigmatic model for comprehending topological phases and their associated edge states, plays an essential role in advancing our understanding of quantum materials and quantum information processing and technology. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid analog-digital protocol designed for the nonadiabatic yet high-fidelity transfer of edge states in an SSH chain, featuring two sublattices, A and B. The core of our approach lies in harnessing the approximate time-dependent counterdiabatic (CD) interaction, derived from adiabatic gauge potentials. However, to enhance transfer fidelity, particularly in long-distance chains, higher-order nested commutators become crucial. To simplify the experimental implementation and navigate computational complexities, we identify the next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping terms between sublattice A sites as dominant CD driving and further optimize them by using variational quantum circuits. Through digital quantum simulation, our protocol showcases the capability to achieve rapid and robust solutions, even in the presence of disorder. This analog-digital transfer protocol, an extension of quantum control methodology, establishes a robust framework for edge-state transfer. Importantly, the optimal CD driving identified can be seamlessly implemented across various quantum registers, highlighting the versatility of our approach.</description>

Abstract: We discuss single-shot decoding of quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes with faulty syndrome measurements. We state the problem as a joint source-channel coding problem. By adding redundant rows to the code's parity-check matrix we obtain an additional syndrome error correcting code which addresses faulty syndrome measurements. Thereby, the redundant rows are chosen to obtain good syndrome error correcting capabilities while keeping the stabilizer weights low. Optimal joint decoding rules are derived which, though too complex for general codes, can be evaluated for short quantum codes.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor-based superconducting qubits offer a versatile platform for studying hybrid quantum devices in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. Most of these cQED experiments utilize coplanar waveguides, where the incorporation of DC gate lines is straightforward. Here, we present a technique for probing gate-tunable hybrid devices using a three-dimensional (3D) microwave cavity. A recess is machined inside the cavity wall for the placement of devices and gate lines. We validate this design using a hybrid device based on an InAs-Al nanowire Josephson junction. The coupling between the device and the cavity is facilitated by a long superconducting strip, the antenna. The Josephson junction and the antenna together form a gatemon qubit. We further demonstrate the gate-tunable cavity shift and two-tone qubit spectroscopy. This technique could be used to probe various quantum devices and materials in a 3D cQED architecture that requires DC gate voltages.</description>

Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multiplexing of Rare-earth Emitters in a Co-doped Crystalline Membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral addressing of many individual rare-earth dopants in optical resonators offers great potential for realizing distributed quantum information processors. To this end, it is required to understand and control the spectral properties of the emitters in micron-scale devices. Here, erbium emitters are investigated in a Fabry-Perot resonator which contains a ten-micrometer-thin membrane of crystalline yttrium orthosilicate that is co-doped with europium. The co-doping allows for tailoring the inhomogeneous distribution of the emitter frequency, which enables high-fidelity spectral multiplexing of more than 360 qubits with Purcell factors exceeding 35. At the same time, the optical coherence is preserved up to 0.62(3) ms under dynamical decoupling. Without decoupling, the coherence still reaches the lifetime limit for the emitters with the strongest Purcell enhancement that leads up to a 110-fold lifetime reduction, down to 0.104(9) ms. Future work may combine this with long-lived nuclear spin memories, which makes the investigated co-doped membranes a promising platform for quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formal definition of superoscillating function. We discuss the limitations of previously proposed definitions and illustrate that they do not cover the full gamut of superoscillatory behaviours. We demonstrate the suitability of the new proposal with several examples of well-known superoscillating functions that were not encompassed by previous definitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the Dunkl harmonic oscillator on the line can be generalized to a quasi-exactly solvable one, which is an anharmonic oscillator with $n+1$ known eigenstates for any $n\in \N$. It is also proved that the Hamiltonian of the latter can also be rewritten in a simpler way in terms of an extended Dunkl derivative. Furthermore, the Dunkl isotropic oscillator and Dunkl Coulomb potentials in the plane are generalized to quasi-exactly solvable ones. In the former case, potentials with $n+1$ known eigenstates are obtained, whereas, in the latter, sets of $n+1$ potentials associated with a given energy are derived.</description>

      <title>Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture search (QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Most QAS algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and thus generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the search process. Predictor-based QAS algorithms can alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performance of circuits according to their structures. However, a high-performance predictor generally requires very time-consuming labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum circuits. Recently, a classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing that architecture search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised representation learning from the search process. Whether unsupervised representation learning can help QAS without any predictor is still an open topic. In this work, we propose a framework QAS with unsupervised representation learning and visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture representation learning so that the learned representation can be directly applied to different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is predictor-free eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum circuits. During the search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to directly search on the latent representation, and compare them with the method Random Search. The results show our framework can more efficiently get well-performing candidate circuits within a limited number of searches.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians. The mechanism of the exponential speedup that appeared in our algorithm is different from all existing quantum algorithms. The idea is to introduce a mapping $f:\text{ }\rho\rightarrow |\rho\rangle$ to use density matrices to represent pure states. We show that this mapping makes sense by giving an efficient method to obtain the information of $|\rho\rangle$ from measurements on $\rho$. Under this mapping, the Lindblad master equation (LME) becomes a Schr\"odinger equation with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which contains natural imaginary time evolution. The steady state of the LME, therefore, corresponds to the ground state of $L^\dag L$ with $L$ the Liouvillian operator of the LME. We show the runtime of the LME has the $\mathcal{O}(log(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling with $\zeta$ the overlap between the initial state and the ground state compared with the $\mathcal{O}(poly(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling in other algorithms. The Hamiltonians $L^\dag L$ are guaranteed to be difficult for classical computers if we believe the simulation of LME is difficult. Further, for any given local Hamiltonian $H$ with known ground energy $E_0$, we give a polynomial-time classical procedure to judge and solve whether there exists $L$ such that $H-E_0=L^\dag L$. Later, We discuss and analyze several important aspects of the algorithm including the non-linear dynamics that appeared in the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards early fault tolerance on a 2$\times$N array of qubits equipped with shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well understood that a two-dimensional grid of locally-interacting qubits is a promising platform for achieving fault tolerant quantum computing. However in the near-future, it may prove less challenging to develop lower dimensional structures. In this paper, we show that such constrained architectures can also support fault tolerance; specifically we explore a 2$\times$N array of qubits where the interactions between non-neighbouring qubits are enabled by shuttling the logical information along the rows of the array. Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a silicon spin qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating that both surface code and more complex qLDPC codes efficiently suppress gate and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform classical machines.</description>

      <title>Recursive Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

Abstract: Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems. This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified into a solver that finds the binary solution that is most likely measured from the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem, conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show that RQRAO outperforms the Goemans--Williamson method and is comparable to state-of-the-art classical solvers. The codes will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected negative entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically-protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially within topological flat bands. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D topological flat bands, however, exhibits novel $S\sim -L_z^2\log L$ entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_z$. Our discovery sheds light on a new interplay between topology and entanglement unrelated to traditional concepts of topological entanglement entropy, and can be experimentally verified through second R\'enyi entropy measurements in ultracold atomic lattices via SWAP operator expectation values.</description>

      <title>Designing high-fidelity two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a bottom-up, first-principles approach to design a two-qubit gate between fluxonium qubits for minimal error, speed, and control simplicity. Our proposed architecture consists of two fluxoniums coupled via a linear resonator. Using a linear coupler introduces the possibility of material optimization for suppressing its loss, enables efficient driving of state-selective transitions through its large charge zero point fluctuation, reduces sensitivity to junction aging, and partially mitigates coherent coupling to two-level systems. Crucially, a resonator-as-coupler approach also suggests a clear path to increased connectivity between fluxonium qubits, by reducing capacitive loading when the coupler has a high impedance. After performing analytic and numeric analyses of the circuit Hamiltonian and gate dynamics, we tune circuit parameters to destructively interfere sources of coherent error, revealing an efficient, fourth-order scaling of coherent error with gate duration. For component properties from the literature, we predict an open-system average CZ gate infidelity of $1.86 \times 10^{-4}$ in 70ns.</description>

      <title>Projective Quantum Eigensolver via Adiabatically Decoupled Subsystem Evolution: a Resource Efficient Approach to Molecular Energetics in Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold immense potential in the field of chemistry, ushering new frontiers to solve complex many body problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. However, noise in the current quantum hardware limits their applicability to large chemical systems. This work encompasses the development of a projective formalism that aims to compute ground-state energies of molecular systems accurately using Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware in a resource efficient manner. Our approach is reliant upon the formulation of a bipartitely decoupled parameterized ansatz within the disentangled unitary coupled cluster (dUCC) framework based on the principles of synergetics. Such decoupling emulates the total parameter optimization in a lower dimensional manifold, while a mutual synergistic relationship among the parameters is exploited to ensure characteristic accuracy. Without any pre-circuit measurements, our method leads to a highly compact fixed-depth ansatz with shallower circuits and fewer expectation value evaluations. Through analytical and numerical demonstrations, we demonstrate the method's superior performance under noise while concurrently ensuring requisite accuracy in future fault-tolerant systems. This approach enables rapid exploration of emerging chemical spaces by efficient utilization of near-term quantum hardware resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible. From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory are derived. The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory and to quantum field theory are given.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that steady-state expectation values predicted by the universal Lindblad equation (ULE) are accurate up to bounded corrections that scale linearly with the effective system-bath coupling, $\Gamma$ (second order in the microscopic coupling). We also identify a near-identity, quasilocal "memory-dressing" transformation, used during the derivation of the ULE, whose inverse can be applied to achieve relative deviations of observables that generically scale to zero with $\Gamma$, even for nonequilibrium currents whose steady-state values themselves scale to zero with $\Gamma$. This result provides a solution to recently identified limitations on the accuracy of Lindblad equations, which highlighted a potential for significant relative errors in currents of conserved quantities. The transformation we identify allows for high-fidelity computation of currents in the weak-coupling regime, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and local conservation laws, while retaining the stability and physicality of a Lindblad-form master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet circuit describing the driven Ising chain with topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. The Floquet unitary evolution operator commutes with such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the return amplitudes in the presence of "space-like" defects stretching around the system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary evolution in the presence of "time-like" defects that implement anti-periodic and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single time step for a system of a few sites, for all of the above defect configurations.</description>

Abstract: Today's most precise optical instruments -- gravitational-wave interferometers and optical atomic clocks -- rely on long storage times for photons to realize their exquisite sensitivity. Optical fiber technology is the most widely deployed platform for realizing long-distance optical propagation. Yet, their application to precision optical measurements is sparse. We review the state-of-the-art in the noise performance of conventional (solid-core) optical fibers from the perspective of precision optical measurements and quantum technology that rely on precise transfer of information over long distances. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of this platform and point to the opportunities that structured fiber technology offers to overcome some of these limitations.</description>

Abstract: The spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry in complex field theory at the exceptional point of the parameter space is known to exhibit interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of a Higgs mechanism. In this work, we derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau model from a non-Hermitian two-band BCS model via path integral and investigate its spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that analog to the Higgs mechanism, the Meissner effect of the complex Ginzburg-Landau model also breaks down at the exceptional point while the gap parameters stay finite.</description>

      <title>Enriched string-net models and their excitations</title>

Abstract: Boundaries of Walker-Wang models have been used to construct commuting projector models which realize chiral unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs) as boundary excitations. Given a UMTC $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Witt class of an anomaly, the article [arXiv:2208.14018] gave a commuting projector model associated to an $\mathcal{A}$-enriched unitary fusion category $\mathcal{X}$ on a 2D boundary of the 3D Walker-Wang model associated to $\mathcal{A}$. That article claimed that the boundary excitations were given by the enriched center/M\"uger centralizer $Z^\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ in $Z(\mathcal{X})$.
  In this article, we give a rigorous treatment of this 2D boundary model, and we verify this assertion using topological quantum field theory (TQFT) techniques, including skein modules and a certain semisimple algebra whose representation category describes boundary excitations. We also use TQFT techniques to show the 3D bulk point excitations of the Walker-Wang bulk are given by the M\"uger center $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$, and we construct bulk-to-boundary hopping operators $Z_2(\mathcal{A})\to Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ reflecting how the UMTC of boundary excitations $Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ is symmetric-braided enriched in $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$.
  This article also includes a self-contained comprehensive review of the Levin-Wen string net model from a unitary tensor category viewpoint, as opposed to the skeletal $6j$ symbol viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Vortex loop dynamics and dynamical quantum phase transitions in 3D fermion matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have emerged as a paradigm shift in understanding nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. However, the challenge lies in identifying order parameters that effectively characterize the associated dynamic phases. In this study, we investigate the behavior of vortex singularities in the phase of the Green's function for a broad class of fermion lattice models in three dimensions after an instantaneous quench in both interacting and non-interacting systems. We find that the full set of vortices form one-dimensional dynamical objects, which we call \emph{vortex loops}. We propose that the number of such vortex loops can be interpreted as a quantized order parameter that distinguishes between different non-equilibrium phases. Our results establish an explicit link between variations in the order parameter and DQPTs in the non-interacting scenario. Moreover, we show that the vortex loops are robust in the weakly interacting case, even though there is no direct relation between the Loschmidt amplitude and the Green's function. Finally, we observe that vortex loops can form complex dynamical patterns in momentum space. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing definitions of dynamical order parameters in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Backflow Corrections by Tensor Representations: Benchmarks on Fermi-Hubbard-type Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11823v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum many-body problem is an important topic in condensed matter physics. To efficiently solve the problem, several methods have been developped to improve the representation ability of wave-functions.For the Fermi-Hubbard model, current state-of-the-art methods are neural network backflows and the hidden fermion Slater determinant. The backflow correction is an efficient way to improve the Slater determinant of free-particles. In this work we propose a tensor representation of the backflow corrected wave-function, we show that for the spinless $t$-$V$ model, the energy precision is competitive or even lower than current state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For models with spin, we further improve the representation ability by considering non-zero backflow corrections on different spins between the orbital and the particle. We benchmark on molecules under STO-3G basis and the Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic and cylindrical boudary conditions. We show that our methods achieve competitive or even lower energy results than current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Design of Coherent Passive Quantum Equalizers Using Robust Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper develops a methodology for the design of coherent equalizing filters for quantum communication channels. Given a linear quantum system model of a quantum communication channel, the aim is to obtain another quantum system which, when coupled with the original system, mitigates degrading effects of the environment. The main result of the paper is a systematic equalizer synthesis algorithm which relies on methods of state-space robust control design via semidefinite programming.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum computation with Cooper pair splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

      <title>An index for quantum cellular automata on fusion spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the GNVW index for 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA) in terms of the Jones index for subfactors leads to a generalization of the index defined for QCA on more general abstract spin chains. These include fusion spin chains, which arise as the local operators invariant under a global (categorical/MPO) symmetry, and as the boundary operators of 2D topological codes. We show that for the fusion spin chains built from the fusion category $\mathbf{Fib}$, the index is a complete invariant for the group of QCA modulo finite depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity is not a measure of distance between states or operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask whether Krylov complexity is mutually compatible with the circuit and Nielsen definitions of complexity. We show that the Krylov complexities between three states fail to satisfy the triangle inequality and so cannot be a measure of distance: there is no possible metric for which Krylov complexity is the length of the shortest path to the target state or operator. We show this explicitly in the simplest example, a single qubit, and in general.</description>

      <title>Universal role of curvature in vacuum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight some universal features concerning the role of spacetime curvature in the entanglement induced between quantum probes coupled to a quantum field in a suitable vacuum state. The probes are initially causally disconnected and non-entangled. We explore the parameter space $\{{\omega}, d_0, \boldsymbol{v}_0\}$ spanned by the energy gap $\omega$ of the detectors, and the initial values of separation distance $d_0$ and relative velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$, both covariantly defined in arbitrary curved spacetime. We also obtain numerical results in de Sitter spacetimes and use these to explore strong curvature regime, while also corroborating our perturbative results in arbitrary curved spacetime. Our analysis shows that curvature can induce entanglement features in certain regions of the above parameter space, in a manner which facilitates using entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Solvers in Production: how to succeed in the NISQ era?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum computing is considered the present and the future within the field of quantum computing. Far from being a passing fad, this trend cannot be considered just a stopgap to address the limitations of NISQ-era devices. The foundations linking both computing paradigms will remain robust over time. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we describe and categorize some of the most frequently used hybrid solvers, resorting to two different taxonomies recently published in the literature. Secondly, we put a special focus on two solvers that are currently deployed in real production and that have demonstrated to be near the real industry. These solvers are the LeapHybridBQMSampler contained in D-Wave's Hybrid Solver Service and Quantagonia's Hybrid Solver. We analyze the performance of both methods using as benchmarks four combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>
