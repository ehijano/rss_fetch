      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

      <title>RHINO: A large horn antenna for detecting the 21cm global signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sky-averaged brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provides a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, particularly before and during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation. This `global signal' is faint, on the order of tens to hundreds of millikelvin, and spectrally relatively smooth, making it exceedingly difficult to disentangle from foreground radio emission and instrumental artefacts. In this paper, we introduce RHINO, an experiment based around a large horn antenna operating from 60-85 MHz. Horn antennas are highly characterisable and provide excellent shielding from their immediate environment, which are potentially decisive advantages when it comes to the beam measurement and modelling problems that are particularly challenging for this kind of experiment. The system also includes a novel continuous wave calibration source to control correlated gain fluctuations, allowing continuous monitoring of the overall gain level without needing to rapidly switch between the sky and a calibration source. Here, we describe the basic RHINO concept, including the antenna design, EM simulations, and receiver electronics. We use a basic simulation and analysis pipeline to study the impact of the limited bandwidth on recovery of physical 21cm global signal model parameters, and discuss a basic calibration scheme that incorporates the continuous wave signal. Finally, we report on the current state of a scaled-down prototype system under construction at Jodrell Bank Observatory.</description>

      <title>Improved Empirical Backgrounds for JWST NIRISS Image/WFSS Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a versatile instrument for collecting imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data for surveys of galaxy clusters, emission-line galaxies, stellar populations, and more. Dispersed zodiacal light imprints distinct structures on space-based near-infrared imaging and WFSS observations, necessitating careful subtraction during JWST NIRISS data reduction. As of 2024-09-24 NIRISS WFSS calibration backgrounds introduce significant spatially-dependent artifacts, up to 5% of the overall background level, which can severely affect data quality and following astronomical analysis. Notably, there are no existing backgrounds for NIRISS imaging data which also show systematic artifacts, such as the `light saber' effect. In this work, we present improved empirical JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS backgrounds derived from all available public data in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters. We demonstrate that our empirical backgrounds provide a more accurate representation of the background structure in NIRISS imaging and WFSS data than existing reference files, mitigating the impact of spatially-dependent artifacts. Our empirical backgrounds are publicly available and can be used to improve the quality of JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS data reduction.</description>

      <title>Multi-image x-ray interferometer module: II. Demonstration of high-resolution x-ray imaging with regular-interval coded apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been developing an x-ray imaging system, Multi-Image X-ray Interferometer Module (MIXIM), to achieve a high angular resolution with a compact system size. MIXIM is comprised of a mask with equally-spaced apertures and an x-ray detector. The aperture size and mask-detector distance determine the system's angular resolution. Although a smaller aperture gives a better resolution, the degree of improvement is limited by a diffraction effect. MIXIM circumvents this problem by utilizing the Talbot effect. Our experiment with the previous model equipped with a multi-pinhole mask obtained an angular resolution of 0.5" with a mask-detector distance of 92 cm. A major downside of the multi-pinhole mask is, however, that it has a very low opening fraction, which results in a very low effective area. Here, we newly adopt to MIXIM a multiple coded aperture (MCA) mask, an array of coded aperture patterns. Our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that the Talbot effect works even for the MCA mask with a high opening fraction of ~50% at 12.4 keV. Consequently, the new MIXIM realizes about 25 times as large an effective area as that of the previous model, while maintaining a high angular resolution of 0.2" and a compact size of ~1.5 m.</description>

      <title>Metal-Mesh Linear Variable Filter for Far-Infrared Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future far-infrared (IR) observatories require compact and cost efficient optical linear variable bandpass filters (LVBFs) to define their instrument spectral bands. We have designed novel far-IR LVBFs that consist of metal-mesh bandpass filters comprised of a gold film with cross-slots of varying sizes along a silicon (Si) substrate with anti-reflection (AR) coatings. We present our work on the simulated and measured transmission of non-AR coated and AR coated LVBFs for bandpass peaks from wavelengths of 24 to 36 $\mu$m with a resolving power ($R=\lambda_0/\Delta\lambda$) of R$\approx$6 for non-AR coated LVBFs and R$\approx$4 for AR coated LVBFs. We also present a method to decrease the effects of out-of-band high frequency transmission exhibited by metal-mesh filters by depositing a thin layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on the metal-mesh of the LVBF. We have fabricated and measured the LVBFs at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures (5 K). We measure a high peak transmission of $\sim$80-90 \% for the AR coated LVBF at 5 K and demonstrate that the a-Si:H LVBF is a promising method to address out-of-band high frequency transmission.</description>

      <title>New Moons of Uranus and Neptune from Ultra-Deep Pencil Beam Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted extremely ultra-deep pencil beam observations for new satellites around both Uranus and Neptune. Tens of images on several different nights in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were obtained and shifted and added together to reach as faint as 26.9 and 27.2 magnitudes in the r-band around Uranus and Neptune, respectively. One new moon of Uranus, S/2023 U1, and two new moons of Neptune, S/2021 N1 and S/2002 N5, were found. S/2023 U1 was 26.6 mags, is about 7 km in diameter and has a distant, eccentric and inclined retrograde orbit similar to Caliban and Stephano, implying these satellites are fragments from a once larger parent satellite. S/2023 U1 almost completely overlaps Stephano in orbital phase space. S/2021 N1 was 26.9 mags, about 14 km in size and has a retrograde orbit similar to Neso and Psamathe, indicating they are a dynamical family. We find S/2021 N1 is in a Kozai-Lidov orbital resonance. S/2002 N5 was 25.9 mags, is about 23 km in size and it makes a family of distant prograde satellites with Sao and Laomedeia. All three new moons show for the first time dynamical groups of moons exist around both Uranus and Neptune. The creation of these groups likely produced dust that could be the source of red material seen on the leading hemispheres of some larger inner satellites like Titania, Oberon and Umbriel. We also detected all known outer moons of Uranus and Neptune on multiple nights. This survey mostly completes the outer satellites of Uranus to about 8 km and Neptune to about 14 km in diameter. The size distributions of satellite dynamical families around the giant planets shows a strong steepening in the power law size distribution smaller than 5 km in diameter. The satellites of a family become much more common smaller than 5 km and their size distribution is consistent with a collisional break-up of a once larger parent satellite.</description>

      <title>GalaxiesML: a dataset of galaxy images, photometry, redshifts, and structural parameters for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dataset built for machine learning applications consisting of galaxy photometry, images, spectroscopic redshifts, and structural properties. This dataset comprises 286,401 galaxy images and photometry from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey PDR2 in five imaging filters ($g,r,i,z,y$) with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts as ground truth. Such a dataset is important for machine learning applications because it is uniform, consistent, and has minimal outliers but still contains a realistic range of signal-to-noise ratios. We make this dataset public to help spur development of machine learning methods for the next generation of surveys such as Euclid and LSST. The aim of GalaxiesML is to provide a robust dataset that can be used not only for astrophysics but also for machine learning, where image properties cannot be validated by the human eye and are instead governed by physical laws. We describe the challenges associated with putting together a dataset from publicly available archives, including outlier rejection, duplication, establishing ground truths, and sample selection. This is one of the largest public machine learning-ready training sets of its kind with redshifts ranging from 0.01 to 4. The redshift distribution of this sample peaks at redshift of 1.5 and falls off rapidly beyond redshift 2.5. We also include an example application of this dataset for redshift estimation, demonstrating that using images for redshift estimation produces more accurate results compared to using photometry alone. For example, the bias in redshift estimate is a factor of 10 lower when using images between redshift of 0.1 to 1.25 compared to photometry alone. Results from dataset such as this will help inform us on how to best make use of data from the next generation of galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Criteria for identifying and evaluating locations that could potentially host the Cosmic Explorer observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatory that is being designed in the 2020s and is envisioned to begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope in Europe. The CE concept currently consists of two widely separated L-shaped observatories in the United States, one with 40 km-long arms and the other with 20 km-long arms. This order of magnitude increase in scale with respect to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observatories will, together with technological improvements, deliver an order of magnitude greater astronomical reach, allowing access to gravitational waves from remnants of the first stars and opening a wide discovery aperture to the novel and unknown. In addition to pushing the reach of gravitational-wave astronomy, CE endeavors to approach the lifecycle of large scientific facilities in a way that prioritizes mutually beneficial relationships with local and Indigenous communities. This article describes the (scientific, cost and access, and social) criteria that will be used to identify and evaluate locations that could potentially host the CE observatories.</description>

      <title>Arm-Locking Frequency Noise Suppression for Astronomical Middle-Frequency Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For space gravitational wave (GW) detection, arm locking is a proposal useful in decreasing the frequency noise of the laser sources for current developing space missions LISA and Taiji/TianQin. In this paper, we study the application of arm locking to the Astrodynamical Middle-frequency Interferometric Gravitational wave Observatory (AMIGO) to decrease the frequency noise of laser sources. For AMIGO, the arm-locking technique can suppress the laser frequency noise by three orders of magnitude. The advantage of this is to make the auxiliary noise assignment for AMIGO easier and more relaxed. For the first-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration, the laser frequency noise contribution is already below the core noise contribution. For the simple Michelson TDI configuration (X0), the arm locking makes the acceleration-thrust scheme, the delay-line scheme, or the combined scheme easier to implement. Within a relatively short period of less than a day (compared to less than twenty days for LISA/Taiji), the Doppler frequency pulling can be efficiently reduced to within $\pm$ 0.001 Hz and does not affect the mission duty cycle much.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major issue in optical astronomical image analysis is the combined effect of the instrument's point spread function (PSF) and the atmospheric seeing that blurs images and changes their shape in a way that is band and time-of-observation dependent. In this work we present a very simple neural network based approach to non-blind image deconvolution that relies on feeding a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) input images that have been preprocessed by convolution with the corresponding PSF and its regularized inverse, a method which is both conceptually simple and computationally less intensive. We also present here, a new approach for dealing with limited input dynamic range of neural networks compared to the dynamic range present in astronomical images.</description>

      <title>What is the Role of Large Language Models in the Evolution of Astronomy Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry.</description>

      <title>Fast and faithful interpolation of numerical relativity surrogate waveforms using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several theoretical waveform models have been developed over the years to capture the gravitational wave emission from the dynamical evolution of compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes. As ground-based detectors improve their sensitivity at low frequencies, the real-time computation of these waveforms can become computationally expensive, exacerbating the steep cost of rapidly reconstructing source parameters using Bayesian methods. This paper describes an efficient numerical algorithm for generating high-fidelity interpolated compact binary waveforms at an arbitrary point in the signal manifold by leveraging computational linear algebra techniques such as singular value decomposition and meshfree approximation. The results are presented for the time-domain \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model that is fine tuned to numerical relativity simulations and parameterized by the two component-masses and two aligned spins. For demonstration, we target a specific region of the intrinsic parameter space inspired by the previously inferred parameters of the \texttt{GW200311\_115853} event -- a binary black hole system whose merger was recorded by the network of advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors during the third observation run. We show that the meshfree interpolated waveforms can be evaluated in $\sim 2.3$ ms, which is about $\times 38$ faster than its brute-force (frequency-domain tapered) implementation in the \textsc{PyCBC} software package at a median accuracy of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales favourably with an increasing number of dimensions of the parameter space. This technique may find use in rapid parameter estimation and source reconstruction studies.</description>
