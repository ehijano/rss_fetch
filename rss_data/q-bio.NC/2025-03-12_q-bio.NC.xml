      <title>Risk and Protective Factors in Parkinsons Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the risk and protective factors associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) is crucial for improving outcomes for patients, individuals at risk, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems. Studying these factors not only enhances our knowledge of the disease but also aids in developing effective prevention, management, and treatment strategies. This paper reviews the key risk and protective factors associated with PD, with a particular focus on the biological mechanisms underlying these factors. Risk factors include genetic mutations, racial predispositions, and environmental exposures, all of which contribute to an increased likelihood of developing PD or accelerating disease progression. Conversely, protective factors such as regular physical exercise, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and higher urate levels have demonstrated potential to reduce inflammation and support mitochondrial function, thereby mitigating disease risk. However, identifying and validating these factors presents significant challenges. To overcome challenges, we propose several solutions and recommendations. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized biomarkers for early diagnosis, investigate gene-environment interactions in greater depth, and refine animal models to better mimic human PD pathology. Additionally, we offer actionable recommendations for PD prevention and management, tailored to healthy individuals, patients diagnosed with PD, and healthcare systems. These strategies aim to improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality of life, and optimize healthcare delivery for PD.</description>

      <title>Freezing chaos without synaptic plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos is ubiquitous in high-dimensional neural dynamics. A strong chaotic fluctuation may be harmful to information processing. A traditional way to mitigate this issue is to introduce Hebbian plasticity, which can stabilize the dynamics. Here, we introduce another distinct way without synaptic plasticity. An Onsager reaction term due to the feedback of the neuron itself is added to the vanilla recurrent dynamics, making the driving force a gradient form. The original unstable fixed points supporting the chaotic fluctuation can then be approached by further decreasing the kinetic energy of the dynamics. We show that this freezing effect also holds in more biologically realistic networks, such as those composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The gradient dynamics are also useful for computational tasks such as recalling or predicting external time-dependent stimuli.</description>

      <title>BrainNet-MoE: Brain-Inspired Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Neurological Disease Identification</title>

Abstract: The Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early differentiation between AD and LBD is crucial because they require different treatment approaches, but this is challenging due to significant clinical overlap, heterogeneity, complex pathogenesis, and the rarity of LBD. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate powerful learning capabilities and offer new hope for accurate diagnosis, existing methods primarily focus on designing "neural-level networks". Our work represents a pioneering effort in modeling system-level artificial neural network called BrainNet-MoE for brain modeling and diagnosing. Inspired by the brain's hierarchical organization of bottom-up sensory integration and top-down control, we design a set of disease-specific expert groups to process brain sub-network under different condition, A disease gate mechanism guides the specializa-tion of expert groups, while a transformer layer enables communication be-tween all sub-networks, generating a comprehensive whole-brain represen-tation for downstream disease classification. Experimental results show superior classification accuracy with interpretable insights into how brain sub-networks contribute to different neurodegenerative conditions.</description>

      <title>A Grid Cell-Inspired Structured Vector Algebra for Cognitive Maps</title>

Abstract: The entorhinal-hippocampal formation is the mammalian brain's navigation system, encoding both physical and abstract spaces via grid cells. This system is well-studied in neuroscience, and its efficiency and versatility make it attractive for applications in robotics and machine learning. While continuous attractor networks (CANs) successfully model entorhinal grid cells for encoding physical space, integrating both continuous spatial and abstract spatial computations into a unified framework remains challenging. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a mechanistic model for versatile information processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal formation inspired by CANs and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), a neuro-symbolic computing framework. The novel grid-cell VSA (GC-VSA) model employs a spatially structured encoding scheme with 3D neuronal modules mimicking the discrete scales and orientations of grid cell modules, reproducing their characteristic hexagonal receptive fields. In experiments, the model demonstrates versatility in spatial and abstract tasks: (1) accurate path integration for tracking locations, (2) spatio-temporal representation for querying object locations and temporal relations, and (3) symbolic reasoning using family trees as a structured test case for hierarchical relationships.</description>

      <title>Adaptive behavior with stable synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07150v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral changes in animals and humans, as a consequence of an error or a verbal instruction, can be extremely rapid. Improvement in behavioral performances are usually associated in machine learning and reinforcement learning to synaptic plasticity, and, in general, to changes and optimization of network parameters. However, such rapid changes are not coherent with the timescales of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for that could be a dynamical network reconfiguration. In the last few years, similar capabilities have been observed in transformers, foundational architecture in the field of machine learning that are widely used in applications such as natural language and image processing. Transformers are capable of in-context learning, the ability to adapt and acquire new information dynamically within the context of the task or environment they are currently engaged in, without the need for significant changes to their underlying parameters. Building upon the notion of something unique within transformers enabling the emergence of this property, we claim that it could also be supported by input segregation and dendritic amplification, features extensively observed in biological networks. We propose an architecture composed of gain-modulated recurrent networks that excels at in-context learning, showing abilities inaccessible to standard networks.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests time-frequency characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to traditional analysis techniques. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) for time-frequency analysis of local neural activity within key functional networks to differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). We obtain time-frequency features based on rs-fMRI BOLD signals from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features while taking into consideration significant demographic features. The DMN and SN show the most discriminative power, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) outperforming chance baselines with mean F1 scores of 0.7097 and 0.7018, respectively, and mean AUCs of 0.8378 and 0.8755, respectively. Follow-up Boruta ML analysis of selected time-frequency (wavelet) features reveals significant (p &lt; 0.05) detail coefficients for all three functional networks, underscoring the need for ML and time-frequency analysis of rs-fMRI BOLD signals in the study of OUD.</description>
