      <title>Unraveling the Mn $L_3$-edge RIXS spectrum of lightly manganese doped Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiment was performed at the Mn $L_3$ edge. A 10 $\%$ Mn-doped Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ compound, where the Mn$^{3+}$ ions are in the 3$d^4$ state, were probed for $dd$ excitations. The dilute doping concentration allows one to treat the dopant Mn$^{3+}$ ions as effectively free in the host ruthenium compound. The local nature of $dd$ RIXS spectroscopy permits one to use a single-site model to simulate the experimental spectra. The simulated spectra reproduces the in-plane [100] experimental RIXS spectrum. We also predict the intensity for the in-plane [110] direction and the out-of-plane spin orientation configuration [001]. Based on our single-ion model we were able to fit the experimental data to obtain the crystal field parameters, the 10Dq value, and the intra-orbital spin-flip energy 2$\mathcal{J}$(or $3J_{H}$, where $J_{H}$ is the Hund's energy) of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion. Utilizing our computed RIXS quantum transition amplitudes between the various $d$ orbitals of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion, the expression for the Kramers-Heisenberg cross section, and a self-consistent fitting procedure we also identify the energy boundaries of the non-spin-flip and spin-flip $dd$ excitations present in the experimental data. From our fitting procedure we obtain $2\mathcal{J} (3J_{H})=2.06$ eV, a value which is in excellent agreement with that computed from the free ion Racah parameters. We also identified the charge transfer boundary. In addition to predicting the microscopic parameters, we find a quantum spin-flip transition in the non-cross ($\sigma_{in}-\sigma_{out}$, $\pi_{in}-\pi_{out}$) x-ray polarization channels of the $dd$ RIXS spectra. A similar transition, was previously predicted to occur in the $\pi-\pi$ channel of the magnon spectrum in the non-collinear non-coplanar Kagome compound composed of Cu$^{2+}$ 3d$^{9}$ ion.</description>

      <title>$\frac{5}{2}$ fractional quantum Hall state in GaAs with Landau level mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau level mixing is the key in understanding the mysterious 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs quantum well. Theoretical calculations with and without Landau level mixing show striking differences. However, the way to deal with the considerable strong Landau level mixing in GaAs is still unsatisfactory. We develop a method combining the screening and the perturbation theories to study the nature of the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs efficiently. The screening which has been succeed in explaining ZnO systems integrates out the low-energy Landau levels close to the related Landau level, while the other high-energy Landau levels are integrated out by the perturbation theory. We find that the ground states still hold the quasi-triplet degeneracy which implies the Pfaffian nature of the system. Furthermore, the particle-hole symmetry is only weakly violated since the particle-hole parity is close to unity. We propose that the ground state can be described by the two-component trial state cluster constructed by the superposition of the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states with varied weights depending on the external conditions. In the experimental environment the two weights are close, corresponding that its thermal conductance slightly biased from 2.5 quanta can be understood straightforwardly.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced nonlinear magnon transport in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the magnon-magnon interaction on the nonlinear magnon transport. The magnon-magnon interaction induces nonreciprocal magnon decay when the time-reversal symmetry is broken, and leads to nonlinear thermal responses of magnons. We construct a theoretical framework to study the nonlinear thermal responses due to the nonreciprocal magnon decay by using the imaginary Dyson equation and quantum kinetic theory, which is then applied to a model of honeycomb ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. An order estimate shows that the nonlinear thermal response from the present mechanism is feasible for experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Composite Hofstadter bands with Dirac fermion spectrum of fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is studied in the semiclassical limit in the framework of the Hofstadter model with a short-range interaction between fermions. In the mean-field approximation, the repulsion between fermions leads to a periodic potential. Numerical calculations show that in the case of the periodic potential with a period that is a multiple on $\frac{1}{\nu}$ of the magnetic cell ($\nu$ is filling of a separated band) composite Hofstadter bands (HBs) are formed. The composite HBs are split into $\frac{1}{\nu}$ subbands, which are separated by the Dirac points. The Chern number of $\gamma$-full filled composite HBs is equal to the Chern number $C_{\gamma}$ of the corresponding HB. The Chern number, equal to $\nu C_{\gamma}$, corresponds to $\nu$-filling of $\gamma$-composite HB. Thus, FQHE is realized by fractional filling of composite HBs.</description>

      <title>A systematic framework to construct unconventional superconducting pairing scar states using multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has the same interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multi-body interactions has the $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, the entanglement entropy, and the level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice, $s$-wave pairing states in a nearest-neighbor interacting system, and spinless $p$-wave pairing states in one dimension.</description>

      <title>A review: The Gor'kov-Teitel'baum thermal activation model for cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While closing their famous paper entitled "Pseudogap: friend or foe of high-Tc?" Norman, Pines, and Kallin underlined that before we have a microscopic theory, we must have a consistent phenomenology. This was in 2005. As it turns out in 2006 a phenomenological theory of the pseudogap state was proposed by Gor'kov and Teitel'baum. This originated from their careful analysis of the Hall effect data, and it has been very successful model as numerous investigations over the years has shown. In this mini-review the essence of the idea of Gor'kov and Teitel'baum is presented. The pseudogap obtained by them from the Hall effect data agrees very well with that obtained from the ARPES data. This famous Gor'kov-Teitel'baum Thermal Activation model (in short GTTA model) not only presents a consistent phenomenology of the pseudogap state but also it rationalizes the Hall angle data and it presents a strong case against the famous "two-relaxation times" idea of Anderson and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Surrogate optimization of variational quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers are touted as a near-term algorithm capable of impacting many applications. However, the potential has not yet been realized, with few claims of quantum advantage and high resource estimates, especially due to the need for optimization in the presence of noise. Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for VQE or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical CPU/GPU) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, passed as an input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ . The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal metal states. The adjacent two critical points make acoustic effects a promising tool to study such states because of their sensitivity to symmetry-breaking transitions. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase and new ultrasound velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The presented theory for the electron quadrupling state gives the same type of singularities that are observed in experiment.</description>

      <title>Geometry of degenerate quantum states, configurations of $m$-planes and invariants on complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometric information contained in quantum states is valuable in various branches of physics, particularly in solid-state physics when Bloch states play a crucial role. While the Fubini-Study metric and Berry curvature form offer comprehensive descriptions of non-degenerate quantum states, a similar description for degenerate states did not exist. In this work, we fill this gap by showing how to reduce the geometry of degenerate states to the non-abelian (Wilczek-Zee) connection $A$ and a previously unexplored matrix-valued metric tensor $G$. Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to finding the $U(N)$ invariants of a configuration of subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$. For two subspaces, the configuration was known to be described by a set of $m$ principal angles that generalize the notion of quantum distance. For more subspaces, we find $3 m^2 - 3 m + 1$ additional independent invariants associated with each triple of subspaces. Some of them generalize the Berry-Pancharatnam phase, and some do not have analogues for 1-dimensional subspaces. We also develop a procedure for calculating these invariants as integrals of $A$ and $G$ over geodesics on the Grassmannain manifold. Finally, we briefly discuss possible application of these results to quantum state preparation and $PT$-symmetric band structures.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport, metal-insulator transition, and Wigner crystallization in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two recent electronic transport experiments from Columbia University and Harvard University have reported record high mobility and low channel densities in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$ monolayers [J. Pack, et al., arXiv:2310.19782; A. Y. Joe, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 056303 (2024)]. A two-dimensional (2D) metal-insulator transition (MIT) is demonstrated in the Columbia sample at low densities, a regime where the formation of a Wigner crystal (WC) is theoretically anticipated in the absence of disorder. We employ the finite-temperature Boltzmann theory to understand the low-temperature transport properties of monolayer TMDs, taking into account realistic disorder scattering. We analyze the experimental results, focusing on the 2D MIT behavior and the influence of temperature and density on mobility and resistivity in the metallic phase. We provide a discussion of the nontrivial carrier density dependence of our transport results. Our analysis elucidates the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the metallic phase, attributing it to Friedel oscillations associated with screened charged impurities. Furthermore, we explore whether Coulomb disorder could lead to the MIT through either a quantum Anderson localization transition or a classical percolation transition. Our theoretical estimates of the disorder-induced MIT critical densities, although smaller, are within a factor of ~2 of the experimental critical density. We examine the exceptionally high melting temperature ~10 K of WCs observed experimentally in the MoSe$_2$ systems at low density, an order of magnitude larger than the pristine melting temperature. This suggests that the observed 2D low-density MIT behavior is likely a result of the complex interplay between disorder effects and interaction-driven WC physics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the low-temperature transport phenomena in TMD monolayers.</description>

      <title>Cooperation between electron-phonon coupling and electronic interaction in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has garnered significant interests. While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has remained elusive. In this work, we perform first-principles calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure and explore of the interplay between EPC and electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional renormalization group approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which selectively couple with the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, showcasing an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed that solely electronic interactions foster $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing characterized by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a low transition temperature. Remarkably, we find that this out-of-plane EPC can act in concert with electronic interactions to promote the onsite and interlayer pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus elevating T$_c$. In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential experimental implications in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Multipartite edge modes and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks model AdS/CFT, but so far they have been limited by involving only systems that are very different from gravity. Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwardly discretize gravity to incorporate it, because that would break diffeomorphism invariance. In this note, we explore a resolution. In low dimensions gravity can be written as a topological gauge theory, which can be discretized without breaking gauge-invariance. However, new problems arise. Foremost, we now need a qualitatively new kind of "area operator," which has no relation to the number of links along the cut and is instead topological. Secondly, the inclusion of matter becomes trickier. We successfully construct a tensor network both including matter and with this new type of area. Notably, while this area is still related to the entanglement in "edge mode" degrees of freedom, the edge modes are no longer bipartite entangled pairs. Instead they are highly multipartite. Along the way, we calculate the entropy of novel subalgebras in a particular topological gauge theory. We also show that the multipartite nature of the edge modes gives rise to non-commuting area operators, a property that other tensor networks do not exhibit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In kagome metals, the chiral current order $\eta$ with time-reversal-symmetry-breaking is the source of various exotic electronic states, while the method of controlling the current order and its interplay with the star-of-David bond order $\phi$ are still unsolved. Here, we reveal that tiny uniform orbital magnetization $M[\eta,\phi]$ is induced by the chiral current order, and its magnitude is prominently enlarged under the presence of the bond order. Importantly, we derive the magnetic-field ($h$)-induced Ginzburg-Landau free energy expression $\Delta F[h,\eta,\phi]$, which enables us to elucidate the field-induced current-bond phase transitions in kagome metals. The emergent current-bond-$h$ trilinear coupling term in the free energy, $-3m_1 h\eta\phi$, naturally explains the characteristic magnetic field sensitive electronic states in kagome metals, such as the field-induced current order and the strong interplay between the bond and current orders. Furthermore, we present a natural explanation for the drastic strain-induced increment of the current order transition temperature T_{TRSB} reported by a recent experiment.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase transitions under CDW state in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K): Significance of mix-type Fermi surface electron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18087v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the multistage phase transitions in V-based kagome metals inside the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, we focus on the impact of the "mix-type" Fermi surface because it is intact in the CDW state on the "pure-type" Fermi surface. On the mixed-type Fermi surface, moderate spin correlations develop, and we reveal that uniform (q=0) bond order is caused by the paramagnon interference mechanism, which is described by the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction. A dominant solution is the E2g-symmetry nematic order, in which the director can be rotated arbitrarily. In addition, we obtain the A1g-symmetry non-nematic order, which leads to the change in the lattice constants without symmetry breaking. The predicted E2g and A1g channel fluctuations at q=0 can be observed by the elastoresistance measurements. These results are useful to understand the multistage phase transitions inside the 2 $\times$ 2 CDW phase.

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures - a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we report on an enhancement of superconductivity beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover realized in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$). We show how strong correlations and multiorbital effects lead into a localized superconducting regime characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. These insights are derived from the development of a theoretical framework to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), in microscopic theories and from first principles, even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Bridging Rokhsar-Kivelson Type and Generic Quantum Phase Transitions via Thermofield Double States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism of the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) model has been frequently used to study topological phase transitions in 2D in terms of the deformed wavefunctions, which are RK-type wavefunctions. A key drawback of the deformed wavefunctions is that the obtained quantum critical points are RK-type, in the sense that the equal-time correlation functions are described by 2D conformal field theories (CFTs). The generic Lorentz invariant quantum critical points described by (2+1)D CFTs can not be obtained from the deformed wavefunctions. To address this issue, we generalize the deformed wavefunction approach to the deformed thermofield double (TFD) state methodology. Through this extension, we can effectively reconstruct the absent temporal dimension at the RK-type quantum critical point. We construct deformed TFD states for a (1+1)D quantum phase transition from a symmetry-protected topological phase to a symmetry-breaking phase, and for generic (2+1)D topological phase transitions from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phase to a trivial paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Transport in the Potential Luttinger Liquids CsNb$_3$Br$_7$S and RbNb$_3$Br$_7$S</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystal structures of ANb$_3$Br$_7$S (A = Rb and Cs) have been refined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and are found to form highly anisotropic materials based on chains of the triangular Nb$_3$ cluster core. The Nb$_3$ cluster core contains seven valence electrons, six of them being assigned to Nb-Nb bonds within the Nb$_3$ triangle and one unpaired d electron. The presence of this surplus electron gives rise to the formation of correlated electronic states. The connectivity in the structures is represented by one-dimensional [Nb$_3$Br$_7$S]$^-$ chains, containing a sulphur atom capping one face ($\mu_3$) of the triangular niobium cluster, which is believed to induce an important electronic feature. Several types of studies are undertaken to obtain deeper insight into the understanding of this unusual type of material: the crystal structure, morphology and elastic properties are analysed, as well the (photo-) electrical properties and NMR relaxation. Electronic structure (DFT) calculations are performed in order to understand the electronic structure and transport in these compounds, and, based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose that the electronic interactions along the Nb chains are sufficiently one-dimensional to give rise to Luttinger liquid (rather than Fermi liquid) behaviour of the metallic electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the RKKY interactions derived from ab initio calculations for the intermetallic compound CeCoSi exhibiting the hidden nonmagnetic order at $T_0$ and examine the instability towards possible multipole orders within the random phase approximation. All 36 multipole interactions up to rank 5 are investigated, and the maximum susceptibility exhibits an antiferro order with $\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{0}$ for nonmagnetic multipoles of monopole $I$ and hexadecapole $H_{0}$, yielding a charge imbalance of $f$ electrons at two Ce atoms in the unit cell. The obtained order can explain some experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Textures Driven by Emergent Spin-Orbit Interaction: A Numerical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective Mott phase and spin nematicity in Ni-substituted FeTe$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The normal state in iron chalcogenides is metallic but highly unusual, with orbital and spin degrees of freedom partially itinerant or localized depending on temperature, leading to many unusual features. In this work, we report on the observations of two of such features, the orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP) and spin nematicity, evidenced in magnetization and magnetotransport [resistivity, Hall effect, anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)] of Fe$_{1-y}$Ni$_y$Te$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals, with $0 &lt; y &lt; 0.21$. Substitution of Ni dopes crystals with electrons, what eliminates some of the hole pockets from Fermi level, leaving only one, originating from $d_{xy}$ orbital. This leads to electron-dominated conduction at low $T$ for $y \gtrsim 0.06$. However, at high temperatures, $T \gtrsim 125 \div 178$ K, the conduction reverses to hole-dominated. Anomalies in magnetization and resistivity are observed at temperatures which approach high-$T$ boundary of the electron-dominated region. Analysis of these effects suggests a link with the appearance of the $d_{z^2}$ hole pockets at X points of the Brillouin zone in the OSMP phase, facilitated by the localization of $d_{xy}$ orbital, as recently reported by angular resolved photoemission experiments ($\textit{J. Huang et al., Commun. Phys. 5, 29 (2022)}$). The low-$T$ AMR shows mixed 4-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry of in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy, with the 4-fold term the largest at small $y$, and suppressed at intermediate $y$. These results are consistent with the mixed stripe/bicollinear magnetic correlations at small $y$, and suppression of stripe correlations at intermediate $y$, indicating development of spin nematicity with increasing Ni doping, which possibly contributes to the suppression of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Separability criterion using one observable for special states: Entanglement detection via quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting entanglement in many-body quantum systems is crucial but challenging, typically requiring multiple measurements. Here, we establish the class of states where measuring connected correlations in just $\textit{one}$ basis is sufficient and necessary to detect bipartite separability, provided the appropriate basis and observables are chosen. This methodology leverages prior information about the state, which, although insufficient to reveal the complete state or its entanglement, enables our one basis approach to be effective. We discuss the possibility of one observable entanglement detection in a variety of systems, including those without conserved charges, such as the Transverse Ising model, reaching the appropriate basis via quantum quench. This provides a much simpler pathway of detection than previous works. It also shows improved sensitivity from Pearson Correlation detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Exact Mazur bounds in the pair-flip model and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By mapping the calculation of Mazur bounds to the enumeration of walks on fractal structures, we present exact bounds on the late-time behavior of spin autocorrelation functions in models exhibiting pair-flip dynamics and more general $p$-flip dynamics. While the pair-flip model is known to exhibit strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the effect of its nontrivial conservation laws on autocorrelation functions has, thus far, only been calculated numerically, which has led to incorrect conclusions about their thermodynamic behavior. Here, using exact results, we prove that infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions exhibit infinite coherence times at the boundary, and that bulk Mazur bounds decay asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{L}$, rather than $1/L$, as had previously been thought. This result implies that the nontrivial conserved operators implied by $p$-flip dynamics have an important qualitative impact on bulk thermalization properties beyond the constraints imposed by the simple global symmetries of the models.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space fluxes, and the microscopics of near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parisi's hypercube model describes a charged particle hopping on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with disordered background fluxes in the large $d$ limit. It was noted previously [Jia and Verbaarschot, J. High Energy Phys. 11 (2020) 154] that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the DS-SYK model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK model. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices. Finally, we revise a claim made the aforementioned reference about the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Order parameters in quasi-1D spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of what is meant by a meanfield. Meanfields are approximately maps - through some self consistency relation - of a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. This mapping can then be solved to represent properties of the complex many body problem using some self consistency relations. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problems (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models, where there is a 3D system composed of weakly coupled 1D spin chains with the coupling in the transverse direction weaker than in the 1D direction. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising (of any coupling sign) and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. We also consider more exotic models to illustrate other methods of solving 1D systems, namely the $N$-state Potts model. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for all three models, we see that they significantly differ from the usual meanfield estimates. Indeed if the 1D direction has coupling $\Gamma$ and the transverse directions have coupling $J$ with $\lambda\sim\frac{\Gamma}{J}\gg1$ then regular meanfield would predict the transition temperature to be $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\Gamma$ for all three models while 1D meanfield predicts temperatures of $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\log\left(\lambda\right)}$ for the Ising and Potts models and $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Cluster 1D meanfield extensions are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Particle-Soliton Degeneracies from Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-invertible topological symmetry operators in massive quantum field theories in (1+1) dimensions. In phases where this symmetry is spontaneously broken we show that the particle spectrum often has degeneracies dictated by the non-invertible symmetry and we deduce a procedure to determine the allowed multiplets. These degeneracies are robust predictions and do not require integrability or other special features of renormalization group flows. We exhibit these conclusions in examples where the spectrum is known, recovering soliton and particle degeneracies. For instance, the Tricritical Ising model deformed by the subleading Z2 odd operator flows to a gapped phase with two degenerate vacua. This flow enjoys a Fibonacci fusion category symmetry which implies a threefold degeneracy of its particle states, relating the mass of solitons interpolating between vacua and particles supported in a single vacuum.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>
