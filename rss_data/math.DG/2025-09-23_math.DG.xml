      <title>On Time-Like Class $\mathcal A$ Surfaces in a Static Space Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider time-like surfaces in the static space-time given by the warped product $\mathbb L^3_1(c)\, _f\times (I,dz^2)$, where $\mathbb L^3_1(c)$ denotes the Lorentzian space form with the constant sectional curvature $c\in\{-1,0,1\}$. In particular, we study the surfaces with light-like $\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^T$. First, we construct a globally defined pseudo-orthonormal frame field on a surface satisfying this condition and deal with the invariants associated with this frame field. Then, we obtain a complete classification theorem for class~$\mathcal A$ surfaces. Finally, we consider some applications of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Stokes' theorem as an entropy-extremizing duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all subsets of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ maximizes the associated information theoretic entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby the boundary of a manifold is the `least informative' subset of the manifold satisfying the Stokes relation.</description>

Abstract: We establish a variant of Huisken's distance comparison principle for reflection symmetric immersed Curve Shortening flow in $\mathbb R^n,n\geq2$.
  As an application, we show that certain symmetric Curve Shortening flow with a one-to-one convex projection develops a Type~I singularity and becomes asymptotically circular.</description>

      <title>Quantitative marked length spectrum rigidity for surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a closed negatively curved surface $(M, g)$ with marked length spectrum sufficiently close (multiplicatively) to that of a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ on $M$. We show there is a smooth diffeomorphism $F:M \to M$ with derivative bounds close to 1, depending on the ratio of the two marked length spectrum functions. This is a two-dimensional version of our main result in [But25b].</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>Reductive homogeneous spaces associated with real forms. A gauge-theoretical generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected complex Lie group. A real form of $G$ is a closed subgroup $H\subset G$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is a real form of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$. A pair $(G,H)$ of this type is reductive, and the corresponding quotient $G/H$ is a reductive homogeneous space whose canonical connection is torsion free. Regarded as a principal $H$-bundle over $G/H$, $G$ comes with tensorial 1-form $\alpha$ of type $\mathrm{Ad}$ and a natural left invariant connection $A$.
  This remark suggests the following gauge theoretical generalisation of the class of reductive pairs of the form $(G,H)$ as above: Let $H$ be an arbitrary Lie group. A triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$, where $P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M$ is a principal $H$-bundle, $\alpha$ a tensorial 1-form of type $\mathrm{Ad}$ on $P$ and $A$ a connection on $P$ will be called admissible if the induced linear maps $A_y\to \mathfrak{h}$, $y\in P$, are all isomorphisms. If this is the case one obtains a canonical linear connection $\nabla^\alpha_A$ on $M$ and a canonical almost complex structure $J^\alpha_A$ on $P$ which, by a result of R. Zentner, is integrable if an only if the pair $(\alpha,A)$ satisfies a gauge invariant first order differential system. A triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$ as above will be called integrable if this integrability condition is satisfied. Any integrable triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$ with $M$ simply connected and $\nabla^\alpha_A$ complete can be identified with the triple associated with a real form of a complex Lie group. In this article we explain the strategy of the proof of this classification result and we prove in detail a theorem which plays an important role in this strategy and is of independent interest. In the last section we introduce the moduli spaces of integrable pairs on a principal bundle, and we give explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Systolic Inequality and Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between systolic geometry and positive scalar curvature through spinorial methods. Our main theorem establishes an upper bound for the two-dimensional stable systole on certain high-dimensional manifolds with positive scalar curvature under a suitable stretch-scale condition. The proof combines techniques from geometric measure theory, reminiscent of Gromov's systolic inequality, with curvature estimates derived from the Gromov-Lawson relative index theorem. This approach provides a new framework for studying the relationship between positive scalar curvature metrics and systolic geometry in higher-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the geometry and uniqueness of asymptotically locally hyperbolic static vacuum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an inequality relating the surface gravity and topology of a horizon in a $3$-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic static space with the geometry at infinity. Equality is achieved only by the Kottler black holes, and this rigidity leads to several new static black hole uniqueness theorems for a negative cosmological constant. First, the ADS-Schwarzschild black hole with critical surface gravity $\kappa=\sqrt{-\Lambda}$ is unique. Second, the toroidal Kottler black holes are unique in the absence of spherical horizons. Third, the hyperbolic Kottler black holes with mass $m&gt;0$ are unique *if* the generalized Penrose inequality holds for the corresponding class of static spaces. Building on work of Ge-Wang-Wu-Xia, we then use this fact to obtain uniqueness for static ALH graphs with hyperbolic infinities.
  This inequality follows from a generalization of the Minkowski inequality in ADS-Schwarzschild space due to Brendle-Hung-Wang. Using optimal coefficients for the sub-static Heintze-Karcher inequality, we construct a new monotone quantity under inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in static spaces with ${\Lambda} &lt; 0$. Another fundamental tool developed in this paper is a regularity theorem for IMCF in asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we prove that a weak solution of IMCF in an ALH 3-manifold with horizon boundary is eventually smooth. This extends the regularity theorem for a spherical infinity due to Shi and Zhu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of the stability thresholds of a big line bundle, and prove explicit bounds on the error terms. This answers Jin--Rubinstein--Tian's questions affirmatively. A key step in our proof is to show that the stability thresholds of a big line bundle can always be computed by quasi-monomial valuations. This generalizes Blum--Jonsson's result on the stability thresholds of an ample line bundle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasilinear inequality $ \Delta_m u+f(u)\leq 0$ on a complete Riemannian manifold, where \begin{align*} m&gt;1,\alpha&gt;m-1 \quad and \quad f(t)&gt; 0,\alpha f(t)-tf^{'}(t)\geq 0, \forall t&gt;0. \end{align*} If for some point $x_0$ and large enough $r$, \begin{align*} vol B_r(x_0)\leq C r^p ln^q r, \end{align*} where $p=\frac{m\alpha}{\alpha-(m-1)},q=\frac{m-1}{\alpha-(m-1)}$ and $B_r(x_0) $ is a geodesic ball of radius $r$ centered at $x_0$, then the inequality possesses no positive weak solution. This generalizes the result in \cite{AS,Sun}.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpolation of Rigid Body Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of interpolating a rigid body motion is to find a spatial trajectory between a prescribed initial and terminal pose. Two variants of this interpolation problem are addressed. The first is to find a solution that satisfies initial conditions on the k-1 derivatives of the rigid body twist. This is called the kth-order initial value trajectory interpolation problem (k-IV-TIP). The second is to find a solution that satisfies conditions on the rigid body twist and its k-1 derivatives at the initial and terminal pose. This is called the kth-order boundary value trajectory interpolation problem (k-BV-TIP). Solutions to the k-IV-TIP for k=1,...,4, i.e. the initial twist and up to the 4th time derivative are prescribed. Further, a solution to the 1-IV-TBP is presented, i.e. the initial and terminal twist are prescribed. The latter is a novel cubic interpolation between two spatial configurations with given initial and terminal twist. This interpolation is automatically identical to the minimum acceleration curve when the twists are set to zero. The general approach to derive higher-order solutions is presented. Numerical results are shown for two examples.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Infinite Euclidean Distance Discriminants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.</description>

      <title>Improving Cram\'er-Rao Bound And Its Variants: An Extrinsic Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric refinement of the classical Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) by incorporating curvature-aware corrections based on the second fundamental form associated with the statistical model manifold. That is, our formulation shows that relying on the extrinsic geometry of the square root embedding of the manifold in the ambient Hilbert space comprising square integrable functions with respect to a fixed base measure offers a rigorous (and intuitive) way to improve upon the CRB and some of its variants, such as the Bhattacharyya-type bounds, that use higher-order derivatives of the log-likelihood. Precisely, the improved bounds in the latter case make explicit use of the elegant framework offered by employing the Fa\`a di Bruno formula and exponential Bell polynomials in expressing the jets associated with the square root embedding in terms of the raw scores. The interplay between the geometry of the statistical embedding and the behavior of the estimator variance is quantitatively analyzed in concrete examples, showing that our corrections can meaningfully tighten the lower bound, suggesting further exploration into connections with estimator efficiency in more general situations.</description>

      <title>Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
  We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.</description>

Abstract: We prove several new restrictions on the Euler characteristic and signature of oriented 4-manifolds with (positively or negatively) pinched sectional curvature. In particular, we show that simply connected 4-manifolds with $\delta\leq \sec\leq 1$, where $\delta=\frac{1}{1+3\sqrt3}\cong 0.161$, are homeomorphic to $S^4$ or $\mathbb C P^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vanishing theorem for uniformly RC $k$-positive Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles is established. It turns out that the holomorphic tangent bundle of a compact complex manifold equipped with a positive $k$-Ricci curvature K\"{a}hler metric is uniformly RC $k$-positive. Two main applications are presented. The first one is to deduce that spaces of some holomorphic tensor fields on such K\"{a}hler or more generally K\"{a}hler-like Hermitian manifolds are trivial, generalizing some recent results. The second one is to show that a compact K\"{a}hler manifold whose holomorphic tangent bundle can be endowed with either a uniformly RC $k$-positive Hermitian metric or a positive $k$-Ricci curvature K\"{a}hler-like Hermitian metric is projective and rationally connected.</description>

Abstract: We determine linear inequalities on the eigenvalues of curvature operators that imply vanishing of the twisted $\hat A$ genus on a closed Riemannian spin manifold, where the twisting bundle is any prescribed parallel bundle of tensors. These inequalities yield surgery-stable curvature conditions tailored to annihilate further rational cobordism invariants, such as the Witten genus, elliptic genus, signature, and even the rational cobordism class itself.</description>

      <title>Discrete Differential Geometry for $C^{1,1}$ Hyperbolic Surfaces of Non-Constant Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a discrete differential geometry for surfaces of non-constant negative curvature, which can be used to model various phenomena from the growth of flower petals to marine invertebrate swimming. Specifically, we derive and numerically integrate a version of the classical Lelieuvre formulas that apply to immersions of $C^{1,1}$ hyperbolic surfaces of non-constant curvature. In contrast to the constant curvature case, these formulas do not provide an explicit method for constructing an immersion but rather describe an immersion via an implicit set of equations. We propose an iterative method for resolving these equations. Because we are interested in scenarios where the curvature is a function of the intrinsic material coordinates, in particular, on the geodesic distance from an origin or from an edge, we suggest a fast marching method for computing geodesic distance on manifolds. We apply our methods to generate surfaces of non-constant curvature and demonstrate how one can introduce branch points to account for the multi-generational buckling and subwrinkling observed in many applications.</description>

Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Orbifold Resolutions: Uniform Elliptic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dirac operators on resolutions of Riemannian orbifolds by developing a uniform elliptic theory. The key idea is to view orbifolds as conically fibred singular (CFS) spaces and resolve them by gluing asymptotically conical fibrations (ACF) into the singular strata. This yields smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions that preserve the large--scale structure of the orbifold while replacing its singularities with well--understood local models.
  Dirac bundles are resolved compatibly with this construction, which allows us to analyse entire families of Dirac operators in a uniform way. Inspired by the linear gluing framework of Hutchings--Taubes, we build uniformly bounded right inverses and describe precisely how kernels and cokernels behave as the geometry degenerates. The analysis relies on weighted spaces adapted to the conically fibred, conically fibred singular and asymptotically conical fibred regions. These allow us to prove Fredholm properties, uniform bounds and to establish exactness of the linear gluing sequence. Consequently, we obtain an index formula decomposing the index into contributions from the orbifold and the ACF models. This framework provides a direct and flexible analytic approach to Dirac operators on orbifold resolutions, avoiding the full edge calculus, and setting the stage for applications to special holonomy metrics and gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Given a Yamaguchi nonrigid parabolic model geometry $(G,P)$ with $G$ simple of real rank at least $3$, we use techniques developed by Erickson to establish the existence of closed, nonflat, essential, regular, normal Cartan geometries modeled on $(G,P)$. Yamaguchi nonrigidity is a necessary condition for admitting nonflat, regular, normal examples. This rules out Lichnerowicz-type conjectures for these model geometries.</description>

In particular, we propose a class of directionally dependent Finsler metrics and establish key results demonstrating their relevance to TDA. Moreover, we show that several Information Theoretic perspectives on TDA can often be recovered through the lens of Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>Acceleration via silver step-size on Riemannian manifolds with applications to Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is extensive literature on accelerating first-order optimization methods in a Euclidean setting. Under which conditions such acceleration is feasible in Riemannian optimization problems is an active area of research. Motivated by the recent success of dynamic stepsize methods in the Euclidean setting, we undertake a study of such algorithms in the Riemannian setting. We provide the new class of algorithms determined by the choice of vector transport that allows the dynamic stepsize acceleration on Riemannian manifolds for the function classes associated with the corresponding vector transport. As a core application, we show our algorithm recovers the standard Wasserstein gradient descent on 2-Wasserstein space, and as a result provides the first provable accelerated gradient method in Wasserstein space. In addition, we validate the numerical strength of the algorithm for standard benchmark tasks on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous SU(2) connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
  Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
  The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.</description>
