      <title>Probing the N=104 midshell region for the r process via precision mass spectrometry of neutron-rich rare-earth isotopes with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich rare-earth Tb, Dy and Ho isotopes using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance technique at the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap. We report on the first experimentally determined mass values for $^{169}$Tb, $^{170}$Dy and $^{171}$Dy, as well as the first direct mass measurements of $^{169}$Dy and $^{169\text{-}171}$Ho. For $^{170}$Ho, the two long-lived ground and isomeric states were resolved and their mass measured, yielding an isomer excitation energy of $E_\text{exc}=150.8(54)$ keV. In addition, we have performed independent crosschecks of previous Penning-trap values obtained for $^{167\text{,} 168}$Tb and $^{167\text{,} 168}$Dy. We have extended the systematics of two-neutron separation energies to the neutron midshell at $N=104$ in all of the studied isotopic chains. Our updated and new mass measurements provide better constraints for the neutron-capture reaction rates relevant to the astrophysical rapid neutron capture (r) process. The r-process abundances calculated with the new mass values seem to produce a steeper minimum at A=170 and differ by around 15-30\% from the abundances computed with the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020 values.</description>

      <title>Possible explanation of the irregular energy dependence of the rapidity width of $\phi$ mesons observed in Pb+Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental data from the NA49 collaboration show an unexpectedly steep rise of the rapidity width of the $\phi$ meson as function of beam energy, which was suggested as possible interesting signal for novel physics. In this work we show that the Ultra-relativistic Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (UrQMD) model is able to reproduce the shapes of the rapidity distributions of most measured hadrons and predicts a common linear increase of the width for all hadrons. Only when following the exact same analysis technique and experimental acceptance of the NA49 and NA61/SHINE collaborations, we find that the extracted value of the rapidity width of the $\phi$ increases drastically for the highest beam energy. We conclude that the observed steep increase of the $\phi$ rapidity width is a problem of limited detector acceptance and the simplified Gaussian fit approximation.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Structure of Quark-Gluon Plasma Unveiled Through Nuclear Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is hindered by our limited understanding of its initial conditions, particularly its longitudinal structure. We propose a novel approach that entails analyzing collisions involving nuclei of similar masses but different deformations. This strategy allows us to vary the initial conditions and collective expansion of the QGP, while minimizing the influence of non-flow correlations. Using a dynamical transport model, we have for the first time extracted the complete longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$). Our findings reveal that although deformation significantly enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it does not alter its longitudinal profile. This approach not only enables the separation of the rapidity dependence of flow from its rapidity decorrelations but also prompts further investigation into other nuclear structural features, such as nuclear skin thickness, to advance our understanding of the QGP's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Precise Mass Measurements of $A=133$ Isobars with the Canadian Penning Trap: Resolving the $Q_{\beta^-}$ anomaly at $^{133}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report precision mass measurements of $^{133}$Sb, $^{133g,m}$Te, and $^{133g,m}$I, produced at CARIBU at Argonne National Laboratory's ATLAS facility and measured using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. These masses clarify an anomaly in the $^{133}$Te $\beta$-decay. The masses reported in the 2020 Atomic Mass Evaluation (M. Wang et al., 2021) produce $Q_{\beta^-}(^{133}$Te)=2920(6) keV; however, the highest-lying $^{133}$I level populated in this decay is observed at $E_i=2935.83(15)$ keV, resulting in an anomalous $Q_{\beta^{-}}^{i}=-16(6)$~keV. Our new measurements give $Q_{\beta^-}(^{133}\text{Te})=2934.8(11)$ keV, a factor of five more precise, yielding $Q{_\beta^i}=-1.0(12)$~keV, a 3$\sigma$ shift from the previous results. This resolves the anomaly and indicates the possibility of an ultralow $Q$-value $\beta$ decay in this system.</description>

      <title>Coherent interactions of a fast proton with a short-range $NN$ correlation in the nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear structure at short $NN$-distances is still poorly understood. In particular, the full quantum structure of the nucleus with a correlated $NN$-pair is a challenge to theory. So far, model descriptions have been limited to the average mean-field picture of the remaining nuclear system after removing the $NN$-pair. In the recent experiment of the BM@N Collaboration at JINR \cite{Patsyuk:2021fju}, the reactions $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pn_s)^{10}\mbox{B}$ and $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pp_s)^{10}\mbox{Be}$ induced by the hard elastic $pp$ scattering were studied. Here, $n_s$ or $p_s$ denote the undetected slow nucleon in the rest frame of $^{12}\mbox{C}$. In contrast to the previous experiments, the residual bound nucleus was also detected which requires a new level of theoretical understanding. In the present work, we apply the technique of fractional parentage coefficients of the translationally-invariant shell model (TISM) to calculate the spectroscopic amplitude of the system $NN-B$ where $B$ is the remaining nuclear system. The spectroscopic amplitude enters the full amplitude of a nuclear reaction. The relative $NN-B$ wave function is no longer a free parameter of the model but is uniquely related to the internal state of $B$. The interaction of the target proton with the $NN$-pair is considered in the impulse approximation. We also include the initial- and final state interactions of absorptive type as well as the single charge exchange processes. Our calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the BM@N data.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radioisotopes for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $3,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>
