      <title>University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spectrophotometric Blue-Sensitive Spectral Time Series Spanning Two Months from Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects are the ejected building blocks of other solar systems. As such, they enable the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible information about nascent extrasolar systems. The discovery of the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system and to compare it to the small bodies in our own. To that end, we present spectrophotometric observations of 3I/ATLAS taken using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. Our data includes the earliest $\lambda\leq3800$ A spectrum of 3I/ATLAS, obtained $\sim$12.5 hours after the discovery announcement. Later spectra confirm previously reported cometary activity, including Ni and CN emission. The data show wavelength-varying spectral slopes ($S\approx($0\%-29\%)/1000 A, depending on wavelength range) throughout the pre-perihelion ($r_h=4.4$-$2.5$ au) approach of 3I/ATLAS. We perform synthetic photometry on our spectra and find 3I/ATLAS shows mostly stable color evolution over the period of our observations, with $g-r$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.69-0.75 mag, $r-i$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.26-0.30 mag, and $c-o$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.50-0.55 mag. Ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS will provide further insight into its potentially extreme composition.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Optimizing Searches for Orbital Precession and Tidal Decay via Transit- and Occultation-Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period exoplanets may exhibit orbital precession driven by several different processes, including tidal interactions with their host stars and secular interactions with additional planets. This motion manifests as periodic shifts in the timing between transits which may be detectable via high-precision and long-baseline transit- and occultation-timing measurements. Detecting precession and attributing it to a particular process may constrain the tidal responses of planets and point to the presence of otherwise undetected perturbers. However, over relatively short timescales, orbital decay driven by the same tidal interactions can induce transit-timing signals similar to the precession signal, and distinguishing between the two processes requires robust assessment of the model statistics. In this context, occultation observations can help distinguish the two signals, but determining the precision and scheduling of observations sufficient to meaningfully contribute can be complicated. In this study, we expand on earlier work focused on searches for tidal decay to map out simple metrics that facilitate detection of precession and how to distinguish it from tidal decay. We discuss properties for a short-period exoplanet system that can maximize the likelihood for detecting such signals and prospects for contributions from citizen-science observations.</description>

      <title>Modeling the meteoroid environment far from the ecliptic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new version (numbered 3.1) of NASA's Meteoroid Engineering Model (MEM) in which we extend the model to handle locations that lie more than a few degrees in latitude off the ecliptic plane. We provide our algorithms for computing the spatial density and directionality of meteoroids far from the ecliptic and discuss their applications. In particular, we demonstrate how correct modeling of the out-of-ecliptic environment is critical for accurately assessing the risk posed by meteoroids to solar observation missions such as Solaris.</description>

      <title>Four Giant Planets from 2024 KMTNet Microlensing Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present analyses of four newly discovered planetary microlensing events from the 2024 KMTNet survey season: KMT-2024-BLG-0176, KMT-2024-BLG-0349, KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and KMT-2024-BLG-2087. In each case, the planetary nature was revealed through distinct types of anomalies in the lensing light curves: a positive bump near the peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0176, an asymmetric peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0349, a short-duration central dip for KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and a caustic-crossing feature for KMT-2024-BLG-2087. Detailed modeling of the light curves confirms that these anomalies are produced by planetary companions with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range of $(1.5\text{--}17.9)\times 10^{-3}$. Despite the diversity of signal morphologies, all planets detected in these events are giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding that of Jupiter in the Solar System. Each planet orbits a host star less massive than the Sun, emphasizing the strength of microlensing in uncovering planetary systems around low-mass stellar hosts.</description>

      <title>The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets III: Impact Driven Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an Earth-analogue atmosphere, water vapour is a key carrier of hydrogen in the lower atmosphere with its transport above the tropopause controlling the atmospheric hydrogen escape rate. On the Earth, this escape is limited by transport though the tropospheric cold trap where water vapour condenses. However, on a tidally-locked exoplanet, the strong day-night temperature gradient drives a global-scale circulation. This circulation could rapidly transport water through the cold trap, potentially increasing hydrogen escape and impacting the composition of potentially habitable worlds. We couple cometary impact and planetary atmospheric models to simulate water-depositing impacts with both a tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmosphere and quantify how atmospheric circulations transport water from the impact site to high altitudes where it can potentially drive escape. The global nature of the atmospheric circulations on a tidally-locked world enhances hydrogen escape, with both our unimpacted tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmospheres exhibiting similar mass loss rates despite the tidally-locked atmosphere being bpth cooler and drier near the surface. When considering the effects of a cometary impact, we find an order of magnitude difference in peak escape rates between impacts on the day-side ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=1.33\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$) and night-side ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=1.51\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$) of a tidally-locked atmosphere, with the latter being of the same order of magnitude as the peak escape rate found for an impact with an Earth-analogue atmosphere ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=2.7\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$). Our results show the importance of understanding the underlying atmospheric circulations when investigating processes, such as hydrogen escape, which depend upon the vertical advective mixing and transport.</description>

      <title>WASP-12, shrouded in mystery or just cold gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the planet-hosting star WASP-12 show a distinctive depression in the \ion{Mg}{ii} and \ion{Ca}{ii} resonance lines. This has been interpreted as a marker of atmospheric loss from the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-12b and the resulting formation of a gas torus around the star. In this paper we quantify the \ion{Mg}{ii} absorption from this torus, compared to that provided by the stellar wind, the stellar astrosphere and the ISM. To do this we piece together the full density profile of \ion{Mg}{ii} from WASP-12 to an observer on Earth using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and observations. We find that the bulk of the gas along the line of sight is contained within a dense torus close to WASP-12. However, the temperatures in this torus are sufficient to promote Mg into a doubly (\ion{Mg}{iii}) or higher ionized state. As a result, the singly ionized fraction (\ion{Mg}{ii}) is low. We find that most of the \ion{Mg}{ii} is not in the torus but in the ISM. Despite this, the total column density of \ion{Mg}{ii} is two orders of magnitude lower than required to explain observations of the system. To resolve this discrepancy, we note that the torus gas is at a temperature where it will cool efficiently. We speculate that the onset of the cooling instability will cause the torus to fragment, forming cold clumps with a higher fraction of \ion{Mg}{ii}, capable of explaining the observed absorption.</description>

      <title>Accretion bottleneck in protoplanetary discs: the role of the stellar spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate angular momentum transport and accretion properties in a sample of protoplanetary discs with dynamical measurements of stellar masses, disc masses, and scale radii. From these data we infer effective $\alpha$-viscosities, finding a remarkably broad range spanning over three orders of magnitude. This spread correlates with the stellar rotation period: systems with shorter periods exhibit significantly lower accretion rates, suggesting that they are undergoing at least temporary episodes of accretion bottleneck. We interpret this behaviour within the framework of magnetospheric accretion models, where the transition between steady accretion and the propeller regime is set by the relative locations of the co-rotation and magnetospheric radii. Our results indicate that stellar spin is a key parameter in regulating mass transfer from the disc to the star, and provide new evidence that the observed dispersion in $\alpha$ reflects transitions between distinct accretion states rather than differences in global disc properties.</description>

      <title>An Orbital House of Cards: Frequent Megaconstellation Close Conjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of objects in orbit is rapidly increasing, primarily driven by the launch of megaconstellations, an approach to satellite constellation design that involves large numbers of satellites paired with their rapid launch and disposal. While satellites provide many benefits to society, their use comes with challenges, including the growth of space debris, collisions, ground casualty risks, optical and radio-spectrum pollution, and the alteration of Earth's upper atmosphere through rocket emissions and reentry ablation. There is substantial potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment. Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Bath in a Past Supernova Gives Birth to Earth-Like Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of astrophysical dynamos and applications to giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields pervade astrophysical systems and strongly influence their dynamics. Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Water versus land on temperate rocky planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water and land surfaces on a planet interact with gases in the atmosphere and with radiation from the star. These interactions define the environments that prevail on the planet, some of which may be more amenable to prebiotic chemistry, some to the evolution of more complex life. This review article covers (i) the physical conditions that determine the ratio of land to sea on a rocky planet, (ii) how this ratio would affect climatic and biologic processes, and (iii) whether future astronomical observations might constrain this ratio on exoplanets. Water can be delivered in multiple ways to a growing rocky planet -- and although we may not agree on the contribution of different mechanism(s) to Earth's bulk water, hydrated building blocks and nebular ingassing could at least in principle supply several oceans' worth. The water that planets sequester over eons in their solid deep mantles is limited by the water concentration at water saturation of nominally anhydrous mantle minerals, likely less than 2000 ppm of the planet mass. Water is cycled between mantle and surface through outgassing and ingassing mechanisms that, while tightly linked to tectonics, do not necessarily require plate tectonics in every case. The actual water/land ratio at a given time emerges from the balance between the volume of surface water on the one hand, and on the other hand, the shape of the planet (its ocean basin volume) that is carved out by dynamic topography, the petrologic evolution of continents, impact cratering, and other surface-sculpting processes. By leveraging the contrast in reflectance properties of water and land surfaces, spatially resolved 2D maps of Earth-as-an-exoplanet have been retrieved from models using real Earth observations, demonstrating that water/land ratios of rocky exoplanets may be determined from data delivered by large-aperture, high-contrast imaging telescopes in the future.</description>

      <title>The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1\% to 150\% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities, reducing local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 18 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H y$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroids in mean-motion resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between binary asteroids and mean motion resonances (MMRs). For more than 700 asteroids from two catalogues, the Johnston Archive [Johnston, 2024] and the Gaia DR3 VizieR list of binary candidates from Liberato et al. [2024], we applied a resonance identification algorithm, treating all planetary perturbations. Our results showed that the presence of binary asteroids in MMRs largely depends on their dynamical class. The highest percentage, more than 30%, is found in the Trans- Neptunian region, where most of these objects have exhibited resonant librations longer than 10 Myr. For the main-belt asteroid pairs,
  this percentage is about 10-12%. Contrary to expectations, the more unstable region populated with NEOs, showed a higher percentage of resonant pairs (above 17%), but with temporal resonant captures. These results could indicate that the mean motion resonances, particularly the stronger ones, could play a role in the evolution and formation of binary systems. Finally, we highlight that in the present paper, 82 resonant binary asteroids are newly identified.</description>

      <title>iSTARMOD: A Python Code to Quantify Chromospheric Activity by Using the Spectral Subtraction Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of the spectral subtraction technique allows measurements of chromospheric activity in late-type stars across several activity indicators, such as H$\alpha$ and the other Balmer lines in the visible, He I D3 and Na I D1, D2, Ca II H and K, and Ca II infrared triplet, as well as the Paschen series and He I $\lambda$10830 lines in the near-infrared. iSTARMOD is an updated and extended version of the original STARMOD code and its subsequent modifications. iSTARMOD is presented in this paper as a Python code developed to quantify chromospheric activity by using the spectral subtraction technique. iSTARMOD improves usability, modularity, and integration with modern data analysis workflows and is publicly available, including several examples that help one learn how to use and test the code. The iSTARMOD code is accompanied here with a series of calibrations of $\chi$-functions, to transform the excess emission equivalent widths measured through iSTARMOD into absolute surface fluxes. The method provided with this code and the corresponding flux calibrations allows for the automatic characterization of the chromospheric activity of a large number of spectra or a large number of stars and is also very useful for mitigating the effect of activity on radial velocities in the search for exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Rogue Vertical Drafts in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere: Evidence and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational evidence of extreme vertical velocities (|w| ge 12.5 m/s and at times greater than 50 m/s) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has emerged in recent years. We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</description>

      <title>Oceanic internal tides: do they get phased at the Equator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mode baroclinic tides play a major role in ocean dynamics, especially for energy redistribution and deep ocean mixing. These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal.
  We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data.</description>

      <title>The Role of Planetary-Scale Waves on the Stratospheric Superrotation in Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum "transfer events", which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~$10^5$ transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, $Q^{'}_{*}$, of $10^6$, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of $Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3}$ and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>The mid-infrared spectrum of $\beta$ Pictoris b. First VLTI/MATISSE interferometric observations of an exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the mid-infrared (&gt; 3 $\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close angular separations (&lt; 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the giant planet $\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of $\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.</description>

      <title>Precise Constraints on the Energy Budget of WASP-121 b from its JWST NIRISS/SOSS Phase Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.</description>

Abstract: Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show active latitudes: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions. This instability creates ideal intersections for low-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important test case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\mu$ binaries. This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.</description>
