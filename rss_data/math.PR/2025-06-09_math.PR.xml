      <title>The Zigzag Strategy for Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a very general class of $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices is in the delocalized phase when the band width $W$ exceeds the critical threshold, $W\gg \sqrt{N}$. In this regime, we show that, in the bulk spectrum, the eigenfunctions are fully delocalized, the eigenvalues follow the universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and quantum unique ergodicity holds for general diagonal observables with an optimal convergence rate. Our results are valid for general variance profiles, arbitrary single entry distributions, in both real-symmetric and complex-Hermitian symmetry classes. In particular, our work substantially generalizes the recent breakthrough result of Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718], obtained for a specific complex Hermitian Gaussian block band matrix. The main technical input is the optimal multi-resolvent local laws -- both in the averaged and fully isotropic form. We also generalize the $\sqrt{\eta}$-rule from [arXiv:2012.13215] to exploit the additional effect of traceless observables. Our analysis is based on the zigzag strategy, complemented with a new global-scale estimate derived using the static version of the master inequalities, while the zig-step and the a priori estimates on the deterministic approximations are proven dynamically.</description>

      <title>Parabolic scaling of a stochastic wave map with co-normal noise: limit and fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the parabolic scaling limit of a damped stochastic wave map from the real line into the two-dimensional sphere, perturbed by multiplicative Gaussian noise of co-normal type. We prove that under this rescaling, the solutions converge to those of the deterministic heat flow for harmonic maps, revealing a transition from stochastic hyperbolic to deterministic parabolic dynamics. We further analyze the fluctuations around this limit, proving a weak central limit theorem and identifying the limiting process as the solution to a linear stochastic partial differential equation. The study combines tools from geometric analysis, stochastic calculus, and functional analysis, offering insights into the interplay between geometry, noise, and scaling in nonlinear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Bi-infinite incipient cluster in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider high-dimensional percolation at the critical threshold. We condition the origin to be disjointly connected to two points, $x$ and $x'$, and subsequently take the limit as $|x|$, $|x'|$ as well as $|x-x'|$ diverge to infinity. This limiting procedure gives rise to a new percolation measure that locally resembles critical percolation but is concentrated on configurations with two disjoint infinite occupied paths. We coin this the bi-infinite incipient percolation cluster. It is mutually singular with respect to incipient infinite clusters that have been constructed in the literature. We achieve the construction through a double lace expansion of the cluster.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Fractional Stochastic p-Laplace Equations Driven by Superlinear Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the fractional p-Laplace equation with a polynomial drift of arbitrary order driven by superlinear transport noise. By the monotone argument, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of an abstract stochastic differential equation satisfying a fully local monotonicity condition. We then apply the abstract result to the fractional stochastic p-Laplace equation defined in a bounded domain. The main difficulty is to establish the tightness as well as the uniform integrability of a sequence of approximate solutions defined by the Galerkin method. To obtain the necessary uniform estimates, we employ the Skorokhod-Jakubowski representation theorem on a topological space instead of a metric space. Since the strong Skorokhod representation theorem is incorrect even in a complete separable metric space, we pass to the limit of stochastic integrals with respect to a sequence of Wiener processes by a weak convergence argument.</description>

      <title>Pathwise quantitative particle approximation of nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equations via relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive non-linear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation from stochastic systems particles with individual and environmental noise via relative entropy method, with pathwise quantitative bounds. Moreover, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution to the associated Fokker-Planck equation. Our proof is based on tools from PDE analysis, stochastic analysis, functional inequalities, and also we use the dissipation of entropy which provides some bound on the Fisher information of the particle system. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>

      <title>Sequencing, task failures, and capacity when failures are driven by a non-homogeneous Poisson process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal sequencing of a batch of tasks on a machine subject to random disruptions driven by a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), such that every disruption requires the interrupted task to be re-processed from scratch, and partially completed work on a disrupted task is wasted. The NHPP models random disruptions whose frequency varies systematically with time. In general the time taken to process a given batch of tasks depends on the order in which the tasks are processed. We find conditions under which the simplest possible sequencing rules - shortest processing time first (SPT) and longest processing time first (LPT) - suffice to minimize the completion time of a batch of tasks.</description>

      <title>Zero-noise selection and Large Deviations in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ for the stochastic transport equation beyond DiPerna-Lions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ solutions of the stochastic transport equation with drift in $L^\infty_t W^{1,q}_x$. We show strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions in a regime of parameters $p,q$ for which non-unique weak solutions of the deterministic transport equation exist. When the intensity of the noise goes to zero, we prove that the solutions of the stochastic transport equation converge to the unique renormalized solution of the transport equation in the sense of DiPerna-Lions. Furthermore, we show that the convergence is governed by a Large Deviations Principle in the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$. Since the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ is not separable, and solutions of the stochastic transport equation lack compactness therein, the weak convergence approach to Large Deviations by Budhiraja, Dupuis, and Maroulas is not directly applicable.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fluctuations for Nonlinear Chemical Reaction Systems with General Rate Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal fluctuations for chemical reaction systems with N species, M reactions, and general rate law. In the limit of large volume, large fluctuations for such models occur with overwhelming probability in the vicinity of the so-called optimal path, which is a basic consequence of the Freidlin-Wentzell theory, and is vital in biochemistry as it unveils the almost deterministic mechanism concealed behind rare noisy phenomena such as escapes from the attractive domain of a stable state and transitions between different metastable states. In this study, an alternative description for optimal fluctuations is proposed in both non-stationary and stationary settings by means of a quantity called prehistory probability in the same setting, respectively. The evolution law of each of them is derived, showing their relationship with the time reversal of a specified family of probability distributions respectively. The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the reversed processes are then proved. In doing so, the prehistorical approach to optimal fluctuations for Langevin dynamics is naturally generalized to the present case, thereby suggesting a strong connection between optimal fluctuations and the time reversal of the chemical reaction model.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the topology of an infinite-server queueing network from population data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies statistical inference in a network of infinite-server queues, with the aim of estimating the underlying parameters (routing matrix, arrival rates, parameters pertaining to the service times) using observations of the network population vector at Poisson time points. We propose a method-of-moments estimator and establish its consistency. The method relies on deriving the covariance structure of different nodes at different sampling epochs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method yields accurate estimates, even in settings with a large number of parameters. Two model variants are considered: one that assumes a known parametric form for the service-time distributions, and a model-free version that does not require such assumptions.</description>

      <title>Speed of coming down from infinity for $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot initial support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process is a probability measure-valued process that is dual to a $\Lambda$-coalescent that allows multiple collisions. In this paper, we consider a class of $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes with Brownian spatial motion and with associated $\Lambda$-coalescents that come down from infinity. Notably, these processes have the compact support property: the support of the process becomes finite as soon as $t&gt;0$, even though the initial measure has unbounded support. We obtain asymptotic results characterizing the rates at which the initial supports become finite. The rates of coming down are expressed in terms of the asymptotic inverse function of the tail distribution of the initial measure and the speed function of coming down from infinity for the corresponding $\Lambda$-coalescent.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to solve various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>

      <title>The diffusivity of supercritical Bernoulli percolation is infinitely differentiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, the diffusivity and conductivity on $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Bernoulli percolation ($d \geq 2$) are infinitely differentiable in supercritical regime. This extends a result by Kozlov [Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 44 (1989), no. 2(266), pp 79 - 120]. The key to the proof is a uniform estimate for the finite-volume approximation of derivatives, which relies on the perturbed corrector equations in homogenization theory. The renormalization of geometry is then implemented in a sequence of scales to gain sufficient degrees of regularity. To handle the higher-order perturbation on percolation, new techniques, including cluster-growth decomposition and hole separation, are developed.</description>

Abstract: A new version of a strong law of large numbers for a ``good'' pairwise independent sequence of random variables (r.v.'s) with a small part of ``bad'' dependent r.v.'s is proposed. The main goal is to relax the assumption on the existence of the expectation for each summand: the members of an ``infrequent'' part of the whole sequence may have moments of orders converging to zero.</description>

      <title>Irregular traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with multiple marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with two or more additional marked points.
  For general chordal configurations, the traces correspond to the real locus of real rational functions; in the radial case, they correspond to the horizontal trajectories of residue-free quadratic differentials. In both settings, we establish the regularity of the trajectories near singularities: no spiraling occurs, and no two trajectories asymptotically converge to the same direction.
  Moreover, in the radial case with non-zero spin at the marked interior point, we show that the spin induces a spiraling behavior at the marked interior point.
  However, this regularity breaks down when multiple interior marked points are present. In such cases, trajectories may asymptotically approach the same direction, and spiraling can occur even in the absence of spin. We present explicit counterexamples generated using MATLAB, with code provided for reference.</description>

      <title>Poisson Midpoint Method for Log Concave Sampling: Beyond the Strong Error Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stability of Mean-Field Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures. This paper studies the stability properties of the mean-field approximation when the target distribution varies within the class of strongly log-concave measures. We establish dimension-free Lipschitz continuity of the MFVI optimizer with respect to the target distribution, measured in the 2-Wasserstein distance, with Lipschitz constant inversely proportional to the log-concavity parameter. Under additional regularity conditions, we further show that the MFVI optimizer depends differentiably on the target potential and characterize the derivative by a partial differential equation. Methodologically, we follow a novel approach to MFVI via linearized optimal transport: the non-convex MFVI problem is lifted to a convex optimization over transport maps with a fixed base measure, enabling the use of calculus of variations and functional analysis. We discuss several applications of our results to robust Bayesian inference and empirical Bayes, including a quantitative Bernstein--von Mises theorem for MFVI, as well as to distributed stochastic control.</description>

      <title>The half-space KPZ line ensemble and its scaling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, $t \geq 1$, we show that there exists a unique $\mathbb{N}$-indexed line ensemble of random continuous curves $\mathbb{R}_{\le 0} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following properties:
  (1) The top curve is distributed as the time-$t$ Cole--Hopf solution to the half-space KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial condition and Neumann boundary condition with parameter $\alpha$.
  (2) The line ensemble satisfies a one-sided resampling invariance property, involving softly non-intersecting Brownian motions with an attractive potential between pairs at the boundary.
  We call this object the half-space KPZ line ensemble. For $\alpha=\mu t^{-1/3}$ with $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ fixed (critical regime) and for $\alpha&gt;0$ fixed (supercritical regime), we show that the half-space KPZ line ensemble is tight under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling as $t\to\infty$. Moreover, all subsequential limits approximate a parabola and enjoy a one-sided Brownian Gibbs property, described by non-intersecting Brownian motions with pairwise interaction at the boundary. In the critical case this agrees with the half-space Airy line ensemble recently constructed by Dimitrov and Yang. In the supercritical case, we demonstrate a novel structure involving pairwise pinned Brownian motions, one of the main technical contributions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent equations and quantum diffusion for the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson tight-binding model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, with Gaussian noise and at low disorder $\lambda&gt;0$. We derive a diffusive scaling limit for the entries of the resolvent $R(z)$ at imaginary part $\operatorname*{Im} z\sim\lambda^{2+\kappa_d}$, $\kappa_d&gt;0$, with high probability. As consequences, we establish quantum diffusion (in a time-averaged sense) for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator at the longest timescale known to date and improve the best available lower bounds on the localization length of eigenfunctions. Our results for $d=2$ are the first quantum diffusion results for the Anderson model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The proof avoids the use of diagrammatic expansions and instead proceeds by analyzing certain self-consistent equations for $R(z)$. This is facilitated by new estimates for $\|R(z)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q}$ that control the recollisions.</description>

      <title>A New Two-Sample Test for Covariance Matrices in High Dimensions: U-Statistics Meet Leading Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-sample test for covariance matrices in the high-dimensional regime, where the dimension diverges proportionally to the sample size. Our hybrid test combines a Frobenius-norm-based statistic as considered in Li and Chen (2012) with the leading eigenvalue approach proposed in Zhang et al. (2022), making it sensitive to both dense and sparse alternatives. The two statistics are combined via Fisher's method, leveraging our key theoretical result: a joint central limit theorem showing the asymptotic independence of the leading eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and an estimator of the Frobenius norm of the difference of the two population covariance matrices, under suitable signal conditions. The level of the test can be controlled asymptotically, and we show consistency against certain types of both sparse and dense alternatives. A comprehensive numerical study confirms the favorable performance of our method compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture by Starr and log-concavity for random commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Shannon Starr regarding the asymptotics for the number of tuples of commuting permutations with given number of joint orbits. These numbers generalize unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind which count how many single permutations have a given number of cycles. In the case of pairs of permutations, these numbers are related to D'Arcais polynomials and the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula. As a consequence of the above asymptotics, we confirm a log-concavity conjecture in the regime of typical values for the number of joint orbits. As a result of possible indepentent interest in applied mathematics and mathematical physics, we also provide detailed asymptotics, using Mellin transform techniques, for certain multiple series or multivariate Ramanujan sums which are related to ordinary generating functions of Dirichlet convolutions of power laws. Besides these multiple sums asymptotics, our proofs use bivariate saddle point analysis related to the Meinardus theorem in the delicate case of multiple poles for the associated Dirichlet series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain bivariate asymptotics for the number of (unicellular) combinatorial maps (a model of discrete surfaces) as both the size and the genus grow. This work is related to two research topics that have been very active recently: multivariate asymptotics and large genus geometry.
  Our method consists in studying a linear recurrence for these numbers, and in fact it can be applied to many other linear recurrences. We discuss briefly the generality of our method and future research directions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic damped Burgers equation with multiplicative noise defined on the entire real line. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the stochastic damped Burgers equation and establish that the solution is uniformly bounded in time. Furthermore, by employing the uniform estimates on the tails of the solution, we obtain the tightness of a family of probability distributions of the solution. Subsequently, by applying the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem, we establish the existence of invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for stochastic portfolio theory (SPT), which incorporates modern nonlinear price impact and impact decay models. Our main result derives the celebrated master formula for (additive) functional generation of trading strategies in a general high-dimensional market model with price impact. We also develop formulas for an investor's relative wealth with respect to the market portfolio, conditions that guarantee positive observed market prices and derive a stochastic differential equation governing the dynamics of the observed price, investor's holdings and price impact processes. As an application of these results, we develop conditions for relative arbitrage in the price impact setting analogous to previously obtained results for the frictionless setting. Numerical experiments are presented to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An interpolation of discrete rough differential equations and its applications to analysis of error distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution $Y_t$ $(0\le t\le 1)$ and several approximate solutions $\hat{Y}^m_t$ of a rough differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion $B_t$ with the Hurst parameter $1/3&lt;H\leq 1/2$ associated with a dyadic partition of $[0,1]$. We are interested in analysis of asymptotic error distribution of $\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t$ as $m\to\infty$. Although we cannot use martingale central limit theorem, the fourth moment theorem helps us and we already have useful limit theorems of weighted sum processes of Wiener chaos and they can be applied to the study of the asymptotic error distribution. In fact, for some typical approximate solutions, it is proved that the weak limit of $\{(2^m)^{2H-1/2}(\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t)\}_{0\le t\le 1}$ coincides with the weak limit of $\{(2^m)^{2H-1/2}J_tI^m_t\}_{0\le t\le 1}$, where $J_t$ is the Jacobian process of $Y_t$ and $I^m_t$ is a certain weighted sum process of Wiener chaos of order $2$ defined by $B_t$. One of our main results is as follows. The difference $R^m_t=\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t-J_tI^m_t$ is really small compared to the main term $J_tI^m_t$. That is, we show that $(2^m)^{2H-1/2+\varepsilon}\sup_{0\le t\le 1}|R^m_t|\to 0$ almost surely and in $L^p$ (for all $p&gt;1$) for certain explicit positive number $\varepsilon&gt;0$. To this end, we introduce an interpolation process between $Y_t$ and $\hat{Y}^m_t$, and give several estimates of the interpolation process itself and its associated processes.</description>

Abstract: By developing a new technique called the bi-coupling argument, we estimate the relative entropy between different diffusion processes in terms of the distances of initial distributions and drift-diffusion coefficients. As an application, the entropy-cost inequality is established for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with spatial-distribution dependent noise, which is open for a long time and has potential applications in optimal transport, information theory and mean field particle systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating customers to agents in small call centres so that transient performance indicators in terms of expected numbers of losses and abandonments are optimised. To gain insight into the general structure of optimal policies, we start by (i) using backward induction based upon Bellman's equation for a finite-horizon discrete-time model, and (ii) deriving stationary policies for an infinite-horizon continuous-time model with discounting. We then compare the performance of such policies in our original finite-horizon continuous-time model using a first-step analysis applied to the Laplace transforms of the relevant measures.</description>

Abstract: We establish large deviations for dynamical Schr\"{o}dinger problems driven by perturbed Brownian motions when the noise parameter tends to zero. Our results show that Schr\"{o}dinger bridges charge exponentially small masses outside the support of the limiting law that agrees with the optimal solution to the dynamical Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem. Our proofs build on mixture representations of Schr\"{o}dinger bridges and establishing exponential continuity of Brownian bridges with respect to the initial and terminal points.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A switching random walk, commonly known under the misnomer `oscillating random walk', is a real-valued Markov chain whose distribution of increments is determined by the sign of the current position. We explicitly identify an invariant measure of this chain and study its uniqueness, up to a constant factor, within the class of locally finite invariant measures. Next we provide sufficient conditions for the topological recurrence of the switching random walk, and prove its topological irreducibility on a suitably chosen state space. As a consequence of our approach, we establish a new connection between the classical stationary distributions of the renewal theory and stationarity of the Lebesgue measure for random walks. We give further applications concerning reflected random walks and the waiting times in GI/G/1 queues with vacation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a probabilistic methodology, based on random walk estimates, to obtain exponential upper bounds for the probability of observing unusually small maximal components in two classical (near-)critical random graph models. More specifically, we analyse the near-critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ and the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ obtained by performing near-critical $p$-bond percolation on a simple random $d$-regular graph and show that, for each one of these models, the probability that the size of a largest component is smaller than $n^{2/3}/A$ is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/2})$. The exponent $3/2$ is known to be optimal for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ random graph, whereas for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ model the best known upper bound for the above probability was of order $A^{-3/5}$. As a secondary result we show, by means of an optimized version of the martingale method of Nachmias and Peres, that the above probability of observing an unusually small maximal component is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/5})$ in other two critical models, namely a random intersection graph and the quantum random graph; this stretched-exponential bounds also improve upon the known (polynomial) bounds available for these other two critical models.</description>

      <title>Improving the convergence of Markov chains via permutations and projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims at improving the convergence to equilibrium of finite ergodic Markov chains via permutations and projections. First, we prove that a specific mixture of permuted Markov chains arises naturally as a projection under the KL divergence or the squared-Frobenius norm. We then compare various mixing properties of the mixture with other competing Markov chain samplers and demonstrate that it enjoys improved convergence. This geometric perspective motivates us to propose samplers based on alternating projections to combine different permutations and to analyze their rate of convergence. We give necessary, and under some additional assumptions also sufficient, conditions for the projection to achieve stationarity in the limit in terms of the trace of the transition matrix. We proceed to discuss tuning strategies of the projection samplers when these permutations are viewed as parameters. Along the way, we reveal connections between the mixture and a Markov chain Sylvester's equation as well as assignment problems, and highlight how these can be used to understand and improve Markov chain mixing. We provide two examples as illustrations. In the first example, the projection sampler (with a suitable choice of the permutation) improves upon Metropolis-Hastings in a discrete bimodal distribution with a reduced relaxation time from exponential to polynomial in the system size, while in the second example, the mixture of permuted Markov chain yields a mixing time that is logarithmic in system size (with high probability under random permutation), compared to a linear mixing time in the Diaconis-Holmes-Neal sampler. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on simple statistical physics models to illustrate the improved mixing performance of the proposed projection samplers over standard Metropolis-Hastings.</description>

      <title>Massive Particle Systems, Wasserstein Brownian Motions, and the Dean-Kawasaki Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unifying theory for four different objects: (1) infinite systems of interacting massive particles; (2) solutions to the Dean-Kawasaki equation with singular drift and space-time white noise; (3) Wasserstein diffusions with a.s. purely atomic reversible random measures; (4) metric measure Brownian motions induced by Cheeger energies on $L^2$-Wasserstein spaces.
  For the objects in (1)-(3) we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions, and several characterizations, on an arbitrary locally compact Polish ambient space $M$ with exponentially recurrent Feller driving noise. In the case of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, this amounts to replacing the Laplace operator with some arbitrary diffusive Markov generator $\mathsf{L}$ with ultracontractive semigroup. In addition to a complete discussion of the free case, we consider singular interactions, including, e.g., mean-field repulsive isotropic pairwise interactions of Riesz and logarithmic type under the assumption of local integrability.
  We further show that each Markov diffusion generator $\mathsf{L}$ on $M$ induces in a natural way a geometry on the space of probability measures over $M$. When $M$ is a manifold and $\mathsf{L}$ is a drifted Laplace-Beltrami operator, this geometry coincides with the geometry of $L^2$-optimal transportation. The corresponding `geometric Brownian motion' coincides with the 'metric measure Brownian motion' in (4).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential ergodicity in the \( L^1 \)-Wasserstein distance for partially dissipative McKean-Vlasov SDEs has been extensively studied. However, the question of exponential ergodicity in the \( L^2 \)-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy has remained unresolved. This paper addresses the problem by establishing the log-Sobolev inequality for both the time-marginal distributions and the invariant probability measure, providing a positive resolution. As part of the groundwork, the log-Sobolev inequality is investigated for the associated time-inhomogeneous semigroup. The main results are further extended to degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a random bipartite graph with weights assigned to both parts of the vertex sets. Edges are formed independently with probabilities that depend on these weights. This bipartite graph naturally gives rise to a random intersection graph which has nontrivial clustering properties and inhomogeneous vertex degrees. We focus on the situation where the weights are themselves i.i.d. random variables. In the so-called moderate clustering regime, we identify three types of scaling limit for the large connected components in the graphs at criticality, depending on the tail behaviours of the weight distributions of both parts.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Behavior of Erlang-C Model: Mixing Time, Mean Queue Length and Tail Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service systems like data centers and ride-hailing are popularly modeled as queueing systems in the literature. Such systems are primarily studied in the steady state due to their analytical tractability. However, almost all applications in real life do not operate in a steady state, so there is a clear discrepancy in translating theoretical queueing results to practical applications. To this end, we provide a finite-time convergence for Erlang-C systems (also known as $M/M/n$ queues), providing a stepping stone towards understanding the transient behavior of more general queueing systems. We obtain a bound on the Chi-square distance between the finite time queue length distribution and the stationary distribution for a finite number of servers. We then use these bounds to study the behavior in the many-server heavy-traffic asymptotic regimes. The Erlang-C model exhibits a phase transition at the so-called Halfin-Whitt regime. We show that our mixing rate matches the limiting behavior in the Super-Halfin-Whitt regime, and matches up to a constant factor in the Sub-Halfin-Whitt regime.
  To prove such a result, we employ the Lyapunov-Poincar\'e approach, where we first carefully design a Lyapunov function to obtain a negative drift outside a finite set. Within the finite set, we develop different strategies depending on the properties of the finite set to get a handle on the mixing behavior via a local Poincar\'e inequality. A key aspect of our methodological contribution is in obtaining tight guarantees in these two regions, which when combined give us tight mixing time bounds. We believe that this approach is of independent interest for studying mixing in reversible countable-state Markov chains more generally.</description>

      <title>Universality of the convergence rate for spectral radius of complex IID random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent and identically distributed entries $x_{ij} \stackrel{\text { d }}{=} n^{-1 / 2} x$ for some complex random variable $x$ of mean zero and variance one. Let $\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X$ and let $|\sigma_1|:=\max_{1\le i\le n}|\sigma_i|$ be the spectral radius. Set $Y_n=\sqrt{4 n \gamma_n}\left[|\sigma_1|-1-\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_n}{4 n}}\right],$ where
  $\gamma_{n}=\log{n}-2\log{\log{n}}-\log{2\pi}.$ As established in \cite{Cipolloni23Universality}, with specific moment-related conditions imposed on $x,$ the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ is identified as the universal weak limit of $Y_n.$ Subsequently, we extend this line of research and rigorously prove that the convergence rate, previously obtained for complex Ginibre ensembles in \cite{MaMeng25}, also possesses the property of universality. Precisely, one gets
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Y_n \leq x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{2\log\log n}{e\log n}(1+o(1))$$
  and
  $$W_1\left(\mathcal{L}(Y_n), \Lambda\right)=\frac{2\log\log n}{\log n}(1+o(1))$$
  for sufficiently large $n$, where $\mathcal{L}(Y_n)$ is the distribution of $Y_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ gives rise to a natural equivalence relation on partition functions. While these functions are not necessarily conformally covariant, each equivalence class contains a conformally covariant representative.
  Building on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with $q = \infty$, the partition functions satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling exponent $d$.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n, m)$ with $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we further show that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, thereby extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n, n)$ setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic of Coulomb gas integral, Temperley-Lieb type algebras and pure partition functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $K_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for scaled families of Schr\"odinger bridges with reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a large deviation principle for certain sequences of static Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, typically motivated by a scale-parameter decreasing towards zero, extending existing large deviation results to cover a wider range of reference processes. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for studying convergence of such Schr\"{o}dinger bridges to their limiting optimal transport plans. Within generative modeling, Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, or entropic optimal transport problems, constitute a prominent class of methods, in part because of their computational feasibility in high-dimensional settings. Recently, Bernton et al. established a large deviation principle, in the small-noise limit, for fixed-cost entropic optimal transport problems. In this paper, we address an open problem posed by Bernton et al. and extend their results to hold for Schr\"{o}dinger bridges associated with certain sequences of more general reference measures with enough regularity in a similar small-noise limit. These can be viewed as sequences of entropic optimal transport plans with non-fixed cost functions. Using a detailed analysis of the associated Skorokhod maps and transition densities, we show that the new large deviation results cover Schr\"{o}dinger bridges where the reference process is a reflected diffusion on bounded convex domains, corresponding to recently introduced model choices in the generative modeling literature.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of 2-step Transit Probabilities in 2-Coloured Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that the vertices of a regular graph are coloured red and blue with an equal number of each (we call this a balanced colouring). Since the graph is undirected, the number of edges from a red vertex to a blue vertex is clearly the same as the number of edges from a blue vertex to a red vertex. However, if instead of edges we count walks of length 2 which do not stay within their starting colour class, then this symmetry disappears. Our aim in this paper is to investigate how extreme this asymmetry can be.
  Our main question is: Given a $d$-regular graph, for which pairs $(x,y)\in[0,1]^2$ is there a balanced colouring for which the probability that a random walk starting from a red vertex stays within the red class for at least $2$ steps is $x$, and the corresponding probability for blue is $y$?
  Our most general result is that for any $d$-regular graph, these pairs lie within the convex hull of the $2d$ points $\left\{\left(\frac{l}{d},\frac{l^2}{d^2}\right),\left(\frac{l^2}{d^2},\frac{l}{d}\right) :0\leq l\leq d\right\}$.
  Our main focus is the torus for which we prove both sharper bounds and existence results via constructions. In particular, for the $2$-dimensional torus, we show that asymptotically, the region in which these pairs of probabilities can lie is exactly the convex hull of: \[ \left\{\left(0,0\right),\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4}\right),\left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{9}{16}\right),\left(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}\right),\left(\frac{9}{16},\frac{3}{4}\right),\left(1,1\right)\right\} \]</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit algebraic example of a subshift of finite type over a group $\Gamma$ with an invariant Markov measure which has completely positive sofic entropy (with respect to `most' sofic approximations) and yet does not have a direct Bernoulli factor, because its model spaces shatter into exponentially many clusters of sub-exponential size. The example and its analysis are related to random low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the $q$-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ``anti-contractivity'' introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Filtering and Spatial Asymptotic Consistency for SPDEs Observed via Spatio-Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the mathematical framework for filtering problems arising from biophysical applications where data is collected from confocal laser scanning microscopy recordings of the space-time evolution of intracellular wave dynamics of biophysical quantities. In these applications, signals are described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and observations can be modelled as functionals of marked point processes whose intensities depend on the underlying signal. We derive both the unnormalized and normalized filtering equations for these systems, demonstrate the asymptotic consistency and approximations of finite dimensional observation schemes respectively partial observations. Our theoretical results are validated through extensive simulations using synthetic and real data. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of filtering with point process observations and provide a robust framework for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Improved Finite-Particle Convergence Rates for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, in both continuous and discrete time, providing a near optimal (in the sense of matching the corresponding i.i.d. rates) double exponential improvement over the recent result by Shi and Mackey (2024). Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow polynomially in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence in continuous time. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws.</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy are studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy for amenable groups using F\o lner sequences, percolative entropy entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups.
  In this work we pursue these notions across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can generally be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting formulas for those determinants can be seen as various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They also establish connections with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and with some more recent exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Free Random Projection for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical inductive biases are hypothesized to promote generalizable policies in reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by explicit hyperbolic latent representations and architectures. Therefore, a more flexible approach is to have these biases emerge naturally from the algorithm. We introduce Free Random Projection, an input mapping grounded in free probability theory that constructs random orthogonal matrices where hierarchical structure arises inherently. The free random projection integrates seamlessly into existing in-context reinforcement learning frameworks by encoding hierarchical organization within the input space without requiring explicit architectural modifications. Empirical results on multi-environment benchmarks show that free random projection consistently outperforms the standard random projection, leading to improvements in generalization. Furthermore, analyses within linearly solvable Markov decision processes and investigations of the spectrum of kernel random matrices reveal the theoretical underpinnings of free random projection's enhanced performance, highlighting its capacity for effective adaptation in hierarchically structured state spaces.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Distribution for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding with Generalized Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a well-known algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data by finding low-dimensional representations. In this paper, we study the convergence of t-SNE with generalized kernels and extend the results of Auffinger and Fletcher in 2023. Our work starts by giving a concrete formulation of generalized input and output kernels. Then we prove that under certain conditions, the t-SNE algorithm converges to an equilibrium distribution for a wide range of input and output kernels as the number of data points diverges.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequality to the setting of Orlicz and Lorentz spaces. Furthermore, we generalize a Kadec--Pe{\l}czy\'nski-type result -- originally established by the first and third authors for $L^p$ spaces with $1 \le p &lt; 2$ -- to a broader class of Orlicz spaces defined via Young functions $\psi$ satisfying $x \le \psi(x) \le x^2$.</description>
