      <title>Persistent currents in ultracold gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <title>Instability and particle current control of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional ring-shaped lattice with the Peierls phase and site-dependent modulations, where the condensate is confined in a single deep trap and the interparticle interaction strength is modulated by a time-periodic driving field. The system has a finite spectrum, which limits the excitation regimes, and the Peierls phase typically induces imbalanced complex hopping amplitudes in each direction, leading to nonzero net particle currents along the lattice chain, which can hold nearly persistent even when the driving field is turned off after half of the period. The configuration provides a specific way for the coherent control of particle currents in many-body quantum systems with the help of an external driving field, and promotes the possible applications in future close-loop atom circuits.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of elementary excitations in disordered binary Bose mixtures: Effects of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the Anderson localization of quasiparticles in binary Bose mixtures in the presence of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections subjected to correlated disordered potentials. We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>

      <title>Universal Gate Set for Optical Lattice Based Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for atom interferometry and demonstrate that there exists a universal set of atom optic components for inertial sensing. These components constitute gates with which we carry out quantum operations and represent input-output matterwave transformations between lattice eigenstates. Each gate is associated with a modulation pattern of the position of the optical lattice according to machine-designed protocols. In this methodology, a sensor can be reprogrammed to respond to an evolving set of design priorities without modifying the hardware. We assert that such a gate set is metrologically universal, in analogy to universal gate sets for quantum computing. Experimental confirmation of the designed operation is demonstrated via in situ imaging of the spatial evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, and by measurement of the momentum probabilities following time-of-flight expansion. The representation of several basic quantum sensing circuits is presented for the measurement of inertial forces, rotating reference frames, and gravity gradients.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum processors in spin systems via robust local pulse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to realize quantum simulation and computation in spin systems with long-range interactions. Our approach relies on the local addressing of single spins with external fields parametrized by Walsh functions. This enables a mapping from a class of target Hamiltonians, defined by the graph structure of their interactions, to pulse sequences. We then obtain a recipe to implement arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians and universal quantum circuits. Performance guarantees are provided in terms of bounds on Trotter errors and total number of pulses. Additionally, Walsh pulse sequences are shown to be robust against various types of pulse errors, in contrast to previous hybrid digital-analog schemes of quantum computation. We demonstrate and numerically benchmark our protocol with examples from the dynamics of spin models, quantum error correction and quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum entanglement in many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e., entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Skew scattering and ratchet effect in photonic graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a comprehensive theoretical study of asymmetric (skew) scattering in photonic graphene, with the main focus on its realization with semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons. As an important consequence of the skew scattering, we prove the appearance of the ratchet effect in this system. Triangular defects in the form of missing micropillars in a regular honeycomb lattice are considered as ones that break the spatial inversion symmetry, thus providing the possibility of the ratchet effect. By means of the numerical solution of the effective Schr\"odinger equation, we provide microscopical insight into the process of skew scattering and determine indicatrices, cross-sections, and asymmetry parameters. In a system with multiple coherently oriented triangular defects, a macroscopic ratchet effect occurs as a unidirectional flux upon noise-like initial conditions. Our study broadens the concept of ratchet phenomena in the field of photonics and optics of exciton-polaritons.</description>
