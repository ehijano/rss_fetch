      <title>Ordinality in Random Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In allocating objects via lotteries, it is common to consider ordinal rules that rely solely on how agents rank degenerate lotteries. While ordinality is often imposed due to cognitive or informational constraints, we provide another justification from an axiomatic perspective: for three-agent problems, the combination of efficiency, strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and a weak form of continuity collectively implies ordinality.</description>

      <title>Human Misperception of Generative-AI Alignment: A Laboratory Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. We find that people overestimate the degree of alignment between GenAI's choices and human choices. In every problem, human subjects' average prediction about GenAI's choice is substantially closer to the average human-subject choice than it is to the GenAI choice. At the individual level, different subjects' predictions about GenAI's choice in a given problem are highly correlated with their own choices in the same problem. We explore the implications of people overestimating GenAI alignment in a simple theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Does Ideological Polarization Lead to Policy Polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I analyze an election involving two parties who are both office- and policy-motivated and who are ideologically polarized. One party may possess a valence advantage. The parties compete by proposing policies on a second policy issue. The analysis reveals a subtle relationship between ideological polarization and policy polarization. If ideologies are highly dispersed, there is a U-shaped relationship between ideological polarization and platform polarization. In contrast, if ideological dispersion is limited, increasing ideological polarization generally results in policy moderation. In both cases, valence plays no role in policy polarization. Finally, as in Buisseret and van Weelden (2022), adding ideological polarization adds nuance on the effects of increasing valence: both high- and low-valence candidates may adopt more extreme positions, depending on the electorate's degree of ideological polarization.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch: Pricing and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a risk-sensitive security-constrained economic dispatch (R-SCED) formulation capturing the tradeoff between dispatch cost and resilience against potential line failures, where risk is modeled via the conditional value at risk (CVaR). In the context of our formulation, we analyze revenue adequacy and side payments of two pricing models, one based on nominal generation costs, and another based on total marginal cost including contingencies. In particular, we prove that the system operator's (SO) merchandising surplus (MS) and total revenue are nonnegative under the latter, while under the former the same does not hold in general. We demonstrate that the proposed R-SCED formulation is amenable to decomposition and describe a Benders' decomposition algorithm to solve it. In numerical examples, we illustrate the differences in MS and total revenue under the considered pricing schemes, and the computational efficiency of our decomposition approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inverse Multiagent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study inverse game theory (resp. inverse multiagent learning) in which the goal is to find parameters of a game's payoff functions for which the expected (resp. sampled) behavior is an equilibrium. We formulate these problems as generative-adversarial (i.e., min-max) optimization problems, for which we develop polynomial-time algorithms to solve, the former of which relies on an exact first-order oracle, and the latter, a stochastic one. We extend our approach to solve inverse multiagent simulacral learning in polynomial time and number of samples. In these problems, we seek a simulacrum, meaning parameters and an associated equilibrium that replicate the given observations in expectation. We find that our approach outperforms the widely-used ARIMA method in predicting prices in Spanish electricity markets based on time-series data.</description>

      <title>Coalitions in Repeated Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.00280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework and solution concept for repeated coalitional behavior. We model history-dependent schemes that deter coalitions from blocking using continuation promises and punishments. We evaluate the effectiveness of these schemes across a range of settings, and apply our results to repeated matching and negotiations.</description>

      <title>The spatial evolution of economic activities and the emergence of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the spatial agglomeration of workers and income in a continuous space-time framework. Local markets feature spatial spillovers and both exogenous and endogenous amenities. Workers relocate to maximise their instantaneous utility, constrained by mobility costs. In the limit of infinite workers, short-run equilibria are described by a partial differential equation (PDE). The PDE reveals spatial dynamics influenced by initial conditions, path dependence, and metastability (persistence), where prolonged stability is disrupted by sharp transitions to new distributions. We characterise conditions for spatial agglomeration in stationary equilibria and demonstrate that social utility consistently increases over time, suggesting efficient spatial allocations. Numerical results replicate key patterns, such as city formation, dependence on historical spatial patterns, and nonlinear out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Efficiency of Random Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the problem of allocating indivisible objects via lottery, a social planner often knows only agents' ordinal preferences over objects, but not their complete preferences over lotteries. Such an informationally constrained planner cannot distinguish between different utility profiles that induce the same rankings over the objects. In this context, we ask what it means to adjudge an allocation as efficient.
  We introduce the concept of unambiguous efficiency, which guarantees no further Pareto improvement regardless of how agents' ordinal preferences extend to lotteries. We compare this concept with the predominant formulation of efficiency in the random allocation literature and explore some structural properties. As an application to mechanism design, we characterize the class of efficient and strategy-proof ordinal mechanisms that satisfy certain regularity conditions.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Unpredictable under Subjective Expected Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a decision maker who is unaware of objects to be sampled and thus cannot form beliefs about the occurrence of particular objects. Ex ante she can form beliefs about the occurrence of novelty and the frequencies of yet to be known objects. Conditional on any sampled objects, she can also form beliefs about the next object being novel or being one of the previously sampled objects. We characterize behaviorally such beliefs under subjective expected utility. In doing so, we relate "reverse" Bayesianism, a central property in the literature on decision making under growing awareness, with exchangeable random partitions, the central property in the literature on the discovery of species problem and mutations in statistics, combinatorial probability theory, and population genetics. Partition exchangeable beliefs do not necessarily satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism. Yet, the most prominent models of exchangeable random partitions, the model by De Morgan (1838), the one parameter model of Ewens (1972), and the two parameter model of Pitman (1995) and Zabell (1997), do satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism. Our characterization allows us to interpret these models as subjective beliefs of a decision maker and to derive the parameters from choice behavior.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics for the Subjective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study robust comparative statics for risk-averse subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizers. Starting with a finite menu of actions totally ordered by sensitivity to risk, I identify the transformations of her menu that lead a decision-maker to take a lower action, regardless of her particular utility function or belief. My main results reveal that a robust decrease in the action selected is guaranteed by an intuitive steepening of the actions' payoffs and necessitates a slightly weaker such steepening. This basic pattern generalizes to a broad class of non-EU preferences.</description>

      <title>Scheduling With Time Discounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a \emph{financial} version of the classic online problem of scheduling weighted packets with deadlines. The main novelty is that, while previous works assume packets have \emph{fixed} weights throughout their lifetime, this work considers packets with \emph{time-decaying} values. Such considerations naturally arise and have wide applications in financial environments, where the present value of future actions may be discounted. We analyze the competitive ratio guarantees of scheduling algorithms under a range of discount rates encompassing the ``traditional'' undiscounted case where weights are fixed (i.e., a discount rate of 1), the fully discounted ``myopic'' case (i.e., a rate of 0), and those in between. We show how existing methods from the literature perform suboptimally in the more general discounted setting. Notably, we devise a novel memoryless deterministic algorithm, and prove that it guarantees the best possible competitive ratio attainable by deterministic algorithms for discount factors up to $\approx 0.77$. Moreover, we develop a randomized algorithm and prove that it outperforms the best possible deterministic algorithm, for any discount rate. While we highlight the relevance of our framework and results to blockchain transaction scheduling in particular, our approach and analysis techniques are general and may be of independent interest.</description>
