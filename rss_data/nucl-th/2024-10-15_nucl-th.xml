      <title>Investigating the Bulk Properties of Charged Particles in Different $\eta$ Bins Using a Modified Tsallis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the double-differential $p_T$ distributions of charged particles in twelve distinct pseudorapidity regions of equal width in $pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV. Utilizing the modified Tsallis function with mean transverse flow velocity, our study demonstrates a very good agreement between experimental data and the model employed. The fit quality is consistently high across all $p_T$ ranges, as assessed by Data/Fit panels accompanying each plot. Extracted parameters, including kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_0$), transverse flow velocity ($\beta_T$), non-extensivity parameter ($q$) and mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ dependencies are shown on pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and collision energy ($\sqrt{s}$). $T_0$, $\beta_T$ and $\langle p_T \rangle$ exhibit a decreasing trend with increasing $\eta$ due to lower in energy transfer along high $\eta$ regions, while they show a heightened sensitivity to $\sqrt{s}$. $q$ increases with $\eta$, indicating a closer thermal equilibrium in mid-$\eta$ particles. The paper also explores correlations among these parameters, emphasizing relationships between $T_0$, $\beta_T$, $q$ and $\langle p_T \rangle$. Our study provides valuable insights into the thermal and dynamic characteristics of high-energy proton-proton collisions, contributing to the broader understanding of the bulk properties of nuclear matter produced in these interactions.</description>

      <title>Learning from knockout reactions using a dispersive optical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the empirical dispersive optical model (DOM) as applied to direct nuclear reactions. The DOM links both scattering and bound-state experimental data through a dispersion relation which allows for fully-consistent, data-informed predictions for nuclei where such data exists. In particular, we review investigations of the electron-induced proton knockout reaction from both $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca in a distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) utilizing the DOM for a fully-consistent description. Viewing these reactions through the lens of the DOM allows us to connect the documented quenching of spectroscopic factors with increased high-momentum proton content in neutron-rich nuclei. A similar DOM-DWIA description of the proton-induced knockout from $^{40}$Ca, however, does not currently fit in the consistent story of its electron-induced counterpart. With the main difference in the proton-induced case being the use of an effective proton-proton interaction, we suggest that a more sophisticated in-medium interaction would lead to consistent results.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on $\Lambda\alpha$ and $\Xi\alpha$ correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the $\Lambda$-${}^4\mathrm{He}$ ($\alpha$) and $\Xi \alpha$ momentum correlation in high-energy collisions to further elucidate the properties of the hyperon-nucleon interactions. For the $\Lambda\alpha$ system, we compare $\Lambda\alpha$ potential models with different strengths at short range. We find that the difference among the models is visible in the momentum correlation from a small-size source. This indicates that the $\Lambda\alpha$ momentum correlation can constrain the property of the $\Lambda N$ interaction at short range, which plays an essential role in dense nuclear matter. For the $\Xi\alpha$ system, we employ the folding $\Xi \alpha$ potential based on the lattice QCD $\Xi N$ interactions. The $\Xi \alpha$ potential supports a Coulomb assisted bound state of ${}^5_{\Xi}\mathrm{H}$ in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ channel, while the $\Xi^0\alpha$ channel is unbound. To examine the sensitivity of the correlation function to the nature of the $\Xi \alpha$ potential, we vary the potential strength simulating stronger and weaker interactions. The result of the correlation function clearly reflects the bound state nature in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ correlation.</description>

      <title>Fission fragment distributions within time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A notable issue, the proper description of mass and charge distributions of fission fragments within nonadiabatic descriptions of fission dynamics, is investigated by performing double particle number projection on the outcomes of time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) simulation. The induced fission process of the benchmark nucleus 240Pu is studied. In the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate without any symmetry restrictions, we get the static fission pathway from the two-dimensional potential energy surface, and then the fission dynamics from saddle to scission point are obtained using TDHF. We show that the charge numbers of primary heavy fragments from TDHF simulation strongly depend on the deformations of initial configurations via the two asymmetric fission channels, which can be distinguished according to the dynamical fission trajectories. The charge distribution of fission fragments is well reproduced using the double particle number projection technique. After applying the Gaussian kernel estimation based on the distribution from the double particle number projection technique, the mass distribution is also consistent with the experimental results. Besides, the results of the total kinetic energy of fission fragments are reasonably consistent with the experiments.</description>

      <title>Role of the tensor force in induced fission of 240Pu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results: We find that the tensor force affects the height of fission barriers and the double-humped structure of fission path of 240Pu. On the PES, the fission valley becomes larger in the (Q20, Q30) plane, and the triaxial deformation is suppressed around the outer barrier after considering the tensor force. Incorporating the tensor force into the dynamical process enhances the difference in shape evolution between two asymmetric channels. More interestingly, the charge distribution from TDHF with double PNP calculations shows a strong odd-even effect after including the tensor force. In addition, the total mass and charge distributions of fission fragments show a slight shift towards larger asymmetry and are more consistent with the experiments when tensor components are included. We also find that the tensor force enhances energy gaps of the deformed shells for heavy fragments. Moreover, the TKEs of fragments are in accord with the experiments, and after incorporating the tensor force, we observe a higher concentration of the calculated TKEs for heavy fragments at Z = 52 and Z = 56. Conclusions: The tensor force plays a role in both static and dynamical processes in nuclear fission, improving the accuracy of theoretical descriptions within the current framework. Our calculations have shown that the fission-barrier height with SLy5t is closer to the empirical value than that of SLy5. Additionally, the inclusion of the tensor force not only manifests the odd-even effect in charge distribution but also improves the description of total mass and charge distributions.</description>

      <title>On Two Nucleons Near Unitarity with Perturbative Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the expansion of two-nucleon S-wave scattering phase shifts and pole parameters about Unitarity in Chiral Effective Field Theory with Perturbative Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO): the only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO consists of contributions from scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); N2LO adds only once-iterated OPE. We take advantage of the high degree of symmetry of the nontrivial fixed point at Unitarity, where Physics is universal and invariant under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. Both are explicitly but weakly broken in the Unitarity Expansion, including by OPE. This version applies in the Unitarity Window (45deg&lt;delta(k)&lt;135deg), including around the momentum scales k=mpi/2 and mpi set by branch points of OPE. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k&gt;100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. In the resulting $\chi$EFT with Perturbative Pions in the Unitarity Expansion, both channels describe PWAs and empirical pole parameters well within several mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k&gt;mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with the scale $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}$=300MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore hypothesise: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence, i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO.</description>

      <title>Universal laws for nuclear contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear contact characterizes the nucleon-nucleon pairs in close proximity and serves as an important tool for studying the short-range correlations (SRCs) within atomic nuclei. While they have been extracted for selected nuclei, the investigation of their behavior across the nuclear chart remains limited. Very recently, Yankovich, Pazy, and Barnea have proposed a set of universal laws (YPB laws) to describe the correlation between nuclear contacts and nuclear radii and tested their laws for a small number of nuclei by using the Woods-Saxon mean-field model~[R.\ Yankovich, E.\ Pazy, and N.\ Barnea, arXiv:2407.15068 (2021)]. In this Letter, we extend their study to a majority part of the chart of nuclides within the framework of the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov model, which incorporates several essential beyond-mean-field features and offers a more accurate description of the bulk properties of atomic nuclei. Our results suggest that the YPB laws hold as a good approximation for different nuclear mass regions, with minor deviations attributed to, e.g., isospin-breaking effects. Our work lays a firm foundation for future applications of the YPB laws in finite nuclei and provides new evidence for the long-range nature of the relative abundance of short-range pairs.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of particle-hole type excitation in a Fermi system within the diffusion approximation of kinetic theory for the case of constant diffusion and drift coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of the distribution function for a particle-hole excitation in a Fermi system was calculated using the direct numerical solution of a nonlinear diffusion equation in momentum space. A phenomenological expression for calculating the relaxation time of such an excitation to its equilibrium value has been proposed. It is shown that the relaxation time is dependent on both the excitation energy and the mass number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicted scaling of the pion,~kaon decay constants $f_{\pi}, f_{K} $ and $M_{\eta}^2 = m_{\eta}^2 + m_{\eta^{\prime}}^2 $ has been used in the renormalized $2+1$ flavor quark-meson (RQM) model,~to find a consistent path to chiral limit as the $\pi \ \text{and} \ K $ meson masses approach zero.~The left side of the Columbia plot is generated free from any ambiguity or heuiristic adjustment in the model parameter fixing away from the physical point. The on-shell renormalization of parameters and consistent treatment of the divergent quark one-loop vacuum fluctuations in the RQM model,~make the axial $U_{A}(1)$ anomaly significantly stronger and the light (strange) explicit chiral symmetry breaking strength becomes weaker by a small (relatively large) amount.~The first order chiral transition region in the $m_{\pi}-m_{K}$ and $\mu-m_{K}$ planes of Columbia plot,~increases due to the above novel features of the RQM model.~Comparing the softening effect of quark one-loop vacuum fluctuation on the chiral transition,~it looks overestimated in a recent functional renormalization group study.</description>

      <title>Rotation induced color confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking, chiral partners, and the $K_1$ and $K^*$ in medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the concept of chiral partners. For a vector meson, the isospin-zero and hypercharge-zero state in the flavor octet mixes with the flavor singlet state. Since the flavor singlet vector meson does not have a chiral partner, the mixed $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons will not have chiral partners. This means that even when chiral symmetry is restored, these mesons will not become degenerate with their corresponding parity partners. On the other hand, the $K_1$ and $K^*$ mesons are chiral partners, and both have widths smaller than 100 MeV. Therefore, we emphasize that studying these mesons in environments where chiral symmetry is restored is particularly important for understanding the effect of chiral symmetry restoration on chiral partners and their masses.</description>

      <title>Strong decay widths of S- and P-wave singly-, doubly- and triply-heavy charm and bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of two-body decay widths of heavy baryons into another heavy baryon and a light pseudoscalar meson in the framework of the non-relativistic quark model in combination with the elementary emission model for the strong couplings. The present study includes the decays of 1S- and 1P-wave baryons with one, two or three heavy quarks, either charm (c) or bottom (b). The relative partial widths are given by the appropriate flavor SU(3) isoscalar factors. The flavor, spin and orbital contributions are discussed explicitly as well as selection rules for forbidden decays. The total widths are compared with the available experimental data as well as with other theoretical studies. The calculated widths of singly-heavy baryons are found to be in reasonable agreement with the observed widths. The decay widths of doubly-heavy baryons are suppressed with respect to those of the singly-heavy baryons by the ratios of the quark masses appearing in the orbital contributions.</description>

      <title>General theory of constructing potential with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09647v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory of potentials that support bound states at positive energies (bound states in the continuum). On the theoretical side, we prove that, for systems described by nonlocal potentials of the form $V(r,r')$, bound states at positive energies are as common as those at negative energies. At the same time, we show that a local potential of the form $V(r)$ rarely supports a positive energy bound state. On the practical side, we show how to construct a (naturally nonlocal) potential which supports an arbitrary normalizable state at an arbitrary positive energy. We demonstrate our theory with numerical examples both in momentum and coordinate spaces with emphasis on the important role played by nonlocal potentials. Finally, we discuss how to observe bound states at positive energies, and where to search for nonlocal potentials which may support them.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks $P_c$ in a dynamical coupled-channel approach of $\gamma p \to J/\psi p$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a dynamical coupled-channel approach to photon-induced $J/\psi$ production to search for the trace of the pentaquarks $P_c$. In this approach, the considered open-charm intermediate states are $\Lambda_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$. Scattering amplitude involving $\Lambda_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $J/\psi p$ interactions is calculated from solving a set of coupled-channel integral equations. The coupled-channel interaction potentials are generated from one-boson-exchange. The pentaquarks $P_c$ are dynamically generated from the coupled-channel interactions. Moreover, the background contributions to the $P_c$ signals are assumed to be the Pomeron exchange and $\sigma$ exchange. The predicted total and differential cross sections of $J/\psi$ photoproduction are within the range of the data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-$007$ experiments. It is found that the $\sigma$ exchange plays a crucial role for determining the very near threshold cross section. The total cross section gets enhanced due to the open-charm state rescattering in the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ production regions, and is of order 1 nb.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and quadratic fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and temperature $T$ are investigated in a two-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. With nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in the cases with and without the IMC effect. The correlation and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlation ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{B(Q,T)}=\frac{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ},\ {\hat {\chi}}_2^{B}$, and ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{Q}$ increase with magnetic fields, and the inclusion of IMC effect leads to some enhancement in their values. However, ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{T}$ is altered by the IMC effect. Without IMC effect, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ slightly increases and then decreases with magnetic fields. Taking into account of the IMC effect by $G(eB)$, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ monotonically increases with magnetic fields, and by $T_0(eB)$, it is a nonmonotonic function of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolution, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model and can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Correlation between alpha-decay half-lives and symmetry energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the alpha-decay half-lives of 84 &lt;= Z &lt;= 92 even-even nuclei in the semiclassical WKB approximation framework using the density-dependent cluster model and the density distribution described by various Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU (KIDS) models. Main goal of this work is to find a correlation between the alpha-decay half-lives and the stiffness of the symmtery energy. Parameters of KIDS model are determined to reproduce the nuclear data (energy and charge radii of 40Ca, 48Ca and 208Pb) and the neutron star observations including constraints by NICER, tidal deformability from GW170817, and the maximum mass limit of neutron star observations. We use the KIDS models (A-D) which have distinctive values for the parameters controlling the stiffness of the nuclear matter equation of state. We find that the alpha-decay half-lives increase systematically from KIDS-A model to KIDS-D model. This implies a correlation between the alpha-decay half-lives and the symmetry energy. We find that the correlation can be understood from the dependence of the particle distribution in the core and the surface region on the symmetry energy.</description>

      <title>The Smile of Cheshire Cat At High Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00692v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Re-analysis of the Gamow-Teller distributions for N=Z nuclei, 24Mg, 28Si, and 32S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions of sd shell N=Z nuclei ($^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, and $^{32}$S) are investigated within the framework of proton-neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) using a deformed basis. The nuclear properties of these special nuclei were investigated by the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model. The RMF framework with density-dependent interactions (DD-PC1 and DD-ME2) was employed to compute ground-state deformation parameters (beta 2) using potential energy curves. The $\beta_2$ values computed from the RMF and the finite range droplet model (FRDM) were employed as a free parameter in the pn QRPA calculation to investigate the resulting GT strength distributions.The present model-based analyses compare well with the observed data.</description>

      <title>Isospin composition of fission barriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a microscopic method to study how isospin affect the fission potential of $^{240}$Pu. Our approach uses constrained Hartree-Fock theory (CHF) which allows us to separately investigate the isoscalar and isovector properties of the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). By analyzing the isoscalar and isovector components of the EDF along the fission path we can assess the isovector contribution to fission barriers. We study this effect for the fully adiabatic path to scission. The isovector component of the fission potential is found to increase in magnitude as the nucleus evolves towards scission, exemplifying the importance of stringent constraints on the isovector sector of the nuclear EDF for reliable predictions of fission properties.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the excesses in associated di-photon production at 152 GeV in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistically significant excesses exist at around 152 GeV in associated di-photon production ($\gamma\gamma+X$) in the sidebands of SM Higgs analyses of ATLAS (using the full run-2 dataset). They are most pronounced in the single-$\tau$, missing-transverse-energy, four-jet and $\geqslant1\ell+\!\geqslant1b$-jet channels ($\approx3\sigma$) and can be explained by the Drell-Yan production of new Higgs bosons, i.e. $pp\to W^*\to H^\pm H^0$. We first examine the excesses in a simplified model approach, considering that $H^\pm$ decays to $\tau\nu$, $WZ$ or $tb$. Both the $\tau\nu$ and $tb$ decay modes individually lead to a significance of $\lessapprox4\sigma$ while for $WZ$ one can obtain at most $3.5\sigma$. This is because the decays of $WZ$ lead to multiple leptons contributing to the two-lepton channel which does not show an excess at 152 GeV. Next, we consider two-Higgs-doublet models where the charged Higgs does not decay to $WZ$ at tree-level, finding a significance of $\gtrapprox4\sigma$ for a branching ratio of the new neutral Higgs to photons of $\approx$2%. Even though this branching fraction is quite sizable, it can be obtained in composite models or via the Lagrangian term $\lambda_6 H_1^\dagger H_1 H_2^\dagger H_1+{\rm h.c.}$ breaking the commonly imposed $Z_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In certain kinematic and particle mass configurations, triangle singularities may lead to line-shapes which mimic the effects of resonances. This well-known effect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The goal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau equations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit two- and three-body unitarity.</description>

      <title>Recent $J/\psi$ measurements at the PHENIX experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium is an ideal probe to explore the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unlike Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, quarkonium production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has different production mechanisms, can access different kinematic phase space and may experience different medium densities/temperatures. The PHENIX experiment has collected a large $J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ data set within its unique pseudorapidity region of $1.2&lt;|\eta|&lt;2.2$ in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV from 2014 to 2016. Latest results of normalized charged particle multiplicity dependent normalized forward $J/\psi$ yields and normalized forward $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ ratio in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions as well as forward $J/\psi$ azimuthal anisotropy in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be shown. Comparison with other RHIC and LHC measurements and latest theoretical calculations will be discussed. These PHENIX results provide their unique contributions in improving the understanding of the multi-parton interaction contribution to charmonium production and the recombination/coalescence contribution to charmonium formation within Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>
