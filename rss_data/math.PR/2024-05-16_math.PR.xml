      <title>Tails of extinction time and maximal displacement for critical branching killed L\'{e}vy process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of the tails of extinction time and maximal displacement of a critical branching killed L\'{e}vy process $(Z_t^{(0,\infty)})_{t\ge 0}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, in which all particles (and their descendants) are killed upon exiting $(0, \infty)$. Let $\zeta^{(0,\infty)}$ and $M_t^{(0,\infty)}$ be the extinction time and maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$ of this branching killed L\'{e}vy process and define $M^{(0,\infty)}: = \sup_{t\geq 0} M_t^{(0,\infty)}$. Under the assumption that the offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable distribution, $\alpha\in (1, 2]$, and some moment conditions on the spatial motion, we give the decay rates of the survival probabilities $$ \mathbb{P}_{y}(\zeta^{(0,\infty)}&gt;t), \quad \mathbb{P}_{\sqrt{t}y}(\zeta^{(0,\infty)}&gt;t) $$ and the tail probabilities $$ \mathbb{P}_{y}(M^{(0,\infty)}\geq x), \quad \mathbb{P}_{xy}(M^{(0,\infty)}\geq x). $$ We also study the scaling limits of $M_t^{(0,\infty)}$ and the point process $Z_t^{(0,\infty)}$ under $\mathbb{P}_{\sqrt{t}y}(\cdot |\zeta^{(0,\infty)}&gt;t)$ and $\mathbb{P}_y(\cdot |\zeta^{(0,\infty)}&gt;t)$. The scaling limits under $\mathbb{P}_{\sqrt{t}y}(\cdot |\zeta^{(0,\infty)}&gt;t)$ are represented in terms of super killed Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Recurrence/Transience of Random Walks on Growing Trees and Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a celebrated fact that a simple random walk on an infinite $k$-ary tree for $k \geq 2$ returns to the initial vertex at most finitely many times during infinitely many transitions; it is called transient. This work points out the fact that a simple random walk on an infinitely growing $k$-ary tree can return to the initial vertex infinitely many times, it is called recurrent, depending on the growing speed of the tree. Precisely, this paper is concerned with a simple specific model of a random walk on a growing graph (RWoGG), and shows a phase transition between the recurrence and transience of the random walk regarding the growing speed of the graph. To prove the phase transition, we develop a coupling argument, introducing the notion of less homesick as graph growing (LHaGG). We also show some other examples, including a random walk on $\{0,1\}^n$ with infinitely growing $n$, of the phase transition between the recurrence and transience. We remark that some graphs concerned in this paper have infinitely growing degrees.</description>

      <title>Mean Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations Driven by G-Brownian Motion with Double Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion with double mean reflections, which means that the constraints are made on the law of the solution. Making full use of the backward Skorokhod problem with two nonlinear reflecting boundaries and the fixed-point theory, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are established. We also consider the case where the coefficients satisfy a non-Lipschitz condition using the Picard iteration argument only for the Y component. Moreover, some basic properties including a new version of comparison theorem and connection with a deterministic optimization problem are also obtained.</description>

      <title>A note on convergence of densities to free extreme value distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of free extreme value distributions as universal limit laws for the spectral maximum of free noncommutative real random variables was discovered by Ben Arous and Voiculescu in 2006. This paper contributes to study the convergence of densities towards free extreme value distributions under the von Mises condition for sample distributions.</description>

      <title>Particle transport based study of nucleation in a ferromagnetic three-state spin system with conservative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pose the problem of metastability for a three--state spin system with conservative dynamics. We consider the Blume--Capel model with the Kawasaki dynamics, we prove that, in a particular region of the parameter plane, the metastable state is the unique homogeneous minus state, and we estimate the exit time. To achieve our goal we have to solve several variational problems in the configuration space which result to be particularly involved, due to complicated structure of the trajectories. They key ingredient is the control of the energy differences between the configurations crossed when a spin is transported from the boundary to an internal site of the lattice through a completely arbitrary mixture of the three--state spin species. To master these mechanisms we have introduced a new approach based on the transport of spins along nearest neighbor connected regions of the lattice with constant spin configuration. This novel approach goes beyond the Blume--Capel model and can be used for the study of more general multi--state spin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the concepts of Geometric Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (GBSDEs, for short) and two-driver BSDEs. We demonstrate their natural suitability for modeling dynamic return risk measures. We characterize a broad spectrum of associated BSDEs with drivers exhibiting growth rates involving terms of the form $y|\ln(y)|+|z|^2/y$. We investigate the existence, regularity, uniqueness, and stability of solutions for these BSDEs and related two-driver BSDEs, considering both bounded and unbounded coefficients and terminal conditions. Furthermore, we present a GBSDE framework for representing the dynamics of (robust) $L^{p}$-norms and related risk measures.</description>

      <title>On the number of infinite clusters in the constrained-degree percolation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constrained-degree percolation model on the hypercubic lattice \linebreak $\mathbb{L}^d=(\mathbb{Z}^d,\mathbb{E}^d)$. In this model, there exits a sequence $(U_e)_{e\in\mathbb{E}^d}$ of i.i.d. random variables with distribution $Unif([0,1])$ and a positive integer $k$, which is called a constraint. Each edge $e$ attempts to open at time $U_e$, and the attempt is successful if the number of neighboring edges open at each endvertex of $e$ is at most $k-1$. In \cite{hartarsky2022weakly}, the authors demonstrated that this model undergoes a phase transition when $d\geq3$ and for most nontrivial values of $k$. In the present work, we prove that, for any fixed constraint, the number of infinite clusters at any given time $t\in[0,1)$ is either 0 or 1, almost surely.</description>

      <title>The Eyring-Kramers Law for Extinction Time of Contact Process on Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a precise estimate of the mean of the extinction time of the contact process with a fixed infection rate on a star graph with $N$ leaves. Specifically, we determine not only the exponential main factor but also the sharp sub-exponential prefactor of the asymptotic formula for the mean extinction time as $N\to\infty$. Previously, such detailed asymptotic information on the mean extinction time of the contact process was known only for complete graphs. To achieve these results, we first provide an accurate estimation of the quasi-stationary distribution on non-extinction of the contact process, utilizing special function theory and refined Laplace's method. Subsequently, we employ the recently developed potential theoretic approach to metastability of non-reversible Markov processes, enabling us to deduce these results. The integration of these methodologies represents a novel approach developed in this paper, which has not previously been used in the study of the contact process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 2D nonlinear stochastic heat equations under a logarithmically attenuated white-noise limit with subcritical coupling. We show that solutions asymptotically exhibit Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations. This extends work of Ran Tao, which required a stricter condition on the coupling. Part of the limiting fluctuation is measurable with respect to the original noise and the remainder is independent.</description>

      <title>Despite Absolute Information Advantages, All Investors Incur Welfare Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into financial markets that incorporate a novel form of heterogeneity among investors, specifically in terms of their beliefs regarding the reliability of signals in the business cycle economy model, which may be biased. Unlike most papers in this field, we not only analyze the equilibrium but also examine welfare using objective measures while investors aim to maximize their utility based on subjective measures. Furthermore, we introduce passive investors and use their utility as a benchmark, thereby revealing the phenomenon of double loss sometimes. In the analysis, we examine two effects: the distortion effect on total welfare and the advantage effect of information and highlight their key factors of influence, with a particular emphasis on the proportion of investors. We also demonstrate that manipulating investors' estimation towards the economy can be a way to improve utility and identify an inner connection between welfare and survival.</description>

      <title>Ahead of the Count: An Algorithm for Probabilistic Prediction of Instant Runoff (IRV) Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we probabilistically predict the winner in a ranked-choice election without all ballots being counted? In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm designed to predict outcomes in Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. The algorithm takes as input a set of discrete probability distributions describing vote totals for each candidate ranking and calculates the probability that each candidate will win the election. In fact, we calculate all possible sequences of eliminations that might occur in the IRV rounds and assign a probability to each.
  The discrete probability distributions can be arbitrary and, in applications, could be measured empirically from pre-election polling data or from partial vote tallies of an in-progress election.
  The algorithm is effective for elections with a small number of candidates (five or fewer), with fast execution on typical consumer computers. The run-time is short enough for our method to be used for real-time election night modeling where new predictions are made continuously as more and more vote information becomes available. We demonstrate the algorithm in abstract examples, and also using real data from the 2022 Alaska state elections to simulate election-night predictions and also predictions of election recounts.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for moderately interacting particle systems related to singular kinetic Mckean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of chaos in a class of moderately interacting particle systems for the approximation of singular kinetic McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by alpha-stable processes. Diffusion parts include Brownian (alpha=2) and pure-jump (1&lt;\alpha&lt;2) perturbations and interaction kernels are considered in a non-smooth anisotropic Besov space. Using Duhamel formula, sharp density estimates (recently issued in Hao, Rockner and Zhang 2023), and suitable martingale functional inequalities, we obtain direct estimates on the  convergence rate between the empirical measure of the particle systems toward the McKean-Vlasov distribution. These estimates further lead to quantitative propagation of chaos results in the weak and strong sense.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo methods on compact complex manifolds using Bergman kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new randomized method for numerical integration on a compact complex manifold with respect to a continuous volume form. Taking for quadrature nodes a suitable determinantal point process, we build an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the integral of any Lipschitz function, and show that the estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, with a faster rate than under independent sampling. In particular, seeing a complex manifold of dimension $d$ as a real manifold of dimension $d_{\mathbb{R}}=2d$, the mean squared error for $N$ quadrature nodes decays as $N^{-1-2/d_{\mathbb{R}}}$; this is faster than previous DPP-based quadratures and reaches the optimal worst-case rate investigated by [Bakhvalov 1965] in Euclidean spaces. The determinantal point process we use is characterized by its kernel, which is the Bergman kernel of a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle, and we strongly build upon the work of Berman that led to the central limit theorem in [Berman, 2018].We provide numerical illustrations for the Riemann sphere.</description>

      <title>$p$-Wasserstein barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). We prove that
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters of absolutely continuous measures are unique, and again absolutely continuous
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters admit a multi-marginal formulation
  -- the optimal multi-marginal plan is unique and of Monge form if the marginals are absolutely continuous, and its support has an explicit parametrization as a graph over any marginal space.
  This extends the Agueh--Carlier theory of Wasserstein barycenters [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 43 (2011), no.2, 904--924] to exponents $p\neq 2$. A key ingredient is a quantitative injectivity estimate for the (highly non-injective) map from $N$-point configurations to their $p$-barycenter on the support of an optimal multi-marginal plan. We also discuss the statistical meaning of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Compositional imprecise probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imprecise probability is concerned with uncertainty about which probability distributions to use. It has applications in robust statistics and elsewhere. Imprecise probability can be modelled in various ways, including by convex sets of probability distributions.
  We look at programming language models for imprecise probability. Our desiderata are that we would like our model to support all kinds of composition, categorical and monoidal, in other words, guided by dataflow diagrams. Another equivalent perspective is that we would like a model of synthetic probability in the sense of Markov categories.
  There is already a fairly popular monad-based approach to imprecise probability, but it is not fully compositional because the monad involved is not commutative, which means that we do not have a proper monoidal structure. In this work, we provide a new fully compositional account. The key idea is to name the non-deterministic choices. To manage the renamings and disjointness of names, we use graded monads. We show that the resulting compositional model is maximal. We relate with the earlier monad approach, showing that we obtain tighter bounds on the uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the random bipartite optimal matching problem on a flat torus in two-dimensions, considering general strictly convex power costs of the distance. We extend the successful ansatz first introduced by Caracciolo et al. for the quadratic case, involving a linear Poisson equation, to a non-linear equation of $q$-Poisson type, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the optimal transport cost. Our results establish new asymptotic connections between the energy of the solution to the PDE and the optimal transport cost, providing insights on their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: The problem of high-dimensional path-dependent optimal stopping (OS) is important to multiple academic communities and applications. Modern OS tasks often have a large number of decision epochs, and complicated non-Markovian dynamics, making them especially challenging. Standard approaches, often relying on ADP, duality, deep learning and other heuristics, have shown strong empirical performance, yet have limited rigorous guarantees (which may scale exponentially in the problem parameters and/or require previous knowledge of basis functions or additional continuity assumptions). Although past work has placed these problems in the framework of computational complexity and polynomial-time approximability, those analyses were limited to simple one-dimensional problems. For long-horizon complex OS problems, is a polynomial time solution even theoretically possible? We prove that given access to an efficient simulator of the underlying information process, and fixed accuracy epsilon, there exists an algorithm that returns an epsilon-optimal solution (both stopping policies and approximate optimal values) with computational complexity scaling polynomially in the time horizon and underlying dimension. Like the first polynomial-time (approximation) algorithms for several other well-studied problems, our theoretical guarantees are polynomial yet impractical. Our approach is based on a novel expansion for the optimal value which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-zero-sum optimal stopping game with continuous versus periodic exercise opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new non-zero-sum game of optimal stopping with asymmetric exercise opportunities. Given a stochastic process modelling the value of an asset, one player observes and can act on the process continuously, while the other player can act on it only periodically at independent Poisson arrival times. The first one to stop receives a reward, different for each player, while the other one gets nothing. We study how each player balances the maximisation of gains against the maximisation of the likelihood of stopping before the opponent. In such a setup, driven by a L\'evy process with positive jumps, we not only prove the existence, but also explicitly construct a Nash equilibrium with values of the game written in terms of the scale function. Numerical illustrations with put-option payoffs are also provided to study the behaviour of the players' strategies as well as the quantification of the value of available exercise opportunities.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent Poisson random measures and stochastic integrals constructed from general point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an extension of the Poisson random measure for the formulation of continuous-time reinforcement learning, such that both the frequency and the width of the jumps depend on the path. Starting from a general point process, we define a new Poisson random measure as limit of the linear sum of these counting processes, and name it the Mesgaki random measure. We also construct its Stochastic integral and It\^o's formula.</description>

      <title>Annihilating branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an interacting system of competing particles on the real line. Two populations of positive and negative particles evolve according to branching Brownian motion. When opposing particles meet, their charges neutralize and the particles annihilate, as in an inert chemical reaction. We show that, with positive probability, the two populations coexist and that, on this event, the interface is asymptotically linear with a random slope. A variety of generalizations and open problems are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a system of weakly interacting particles where the heterogenous connections among the particles are described by a graph sequence and the number of particles grows to infinity. Our results extend the existing law of large numbers and propagation of chaos results to the case where the interaction between one particle and its neighbors is expressed as a nonlinear function of the local empirical measure. In the limit of the number of particles which tends to infinity, if the graph sequence converges to a graphon, then we show that the limit system is described by an infinite collection of processes and can be seen as a process in a suitable $L^2$ space constructed via a Fubini extension. The proof is built on decoupling techniques and careful estimates of the Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Three central limit theorems for the unbounded excursion component of a Gaussian field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth, stationary Gaussian field $f$ on Euclidean space with fast correlation decay, there is a critical level $\ell_c$ such that the excursion set $\{f\geq\ell\}$ contains a (unique) unbounded component if and only if $\ell&lt;\ell_c$. We prove central limit theorems for the volume, surface area and Euler characteristic of this unbounded component restricted to a growing box. For planar fields, the results hold at all supercritical levels (i.e. all $\ell&lt;\ell_c$). In higher dimensions the results hold at all sufficiently low levels (all $\ell&lt;-\ell_c&lt;\ell_c$) but could be extended to all supercritical levels by proving the decay of truncated connection probabilities. Our proof is based on the martingale central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Weak approximation for stochastic reaction-diffusion equation near sharp interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that when the diffuse interface thickness $\epsilon$ vanishes, the sharp interface limit of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation is formally a stochastic geometric flow. To capture and simulate such geometric flow, it is crucial to develop numerical approximations whose error bounds depends on $\frac 1\epsilon$ polynomially. However, due to loss of spectral estimate of the linearized stochastic reaction-diffusion equation, how to get such error bound of numerical approximation has been an open problem.
  In this paper, we solve this weak error bound problem for stochastic reaction-diffusion equations near sharp interface limit. We first introduce a regularized problem which enjoys the exponential ergodicity. Then we present the regularity analysis of the regularized Kolmogorov and Poisson equations which only depends on $\frac 1{\epsilon}$ polynomially. Furthermore, we establish such weak error bound. This phenomenon could be viewed as a kind of the regularization effect of noise on the numerical approximation of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). As a by-product, a central limit theorem of the weak approximation is shown near sharp interface limit. Our method of proof could be extended to a number of other spatial and temporal numerical approximations for semilinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>A new adaptive local polynomial density estimation procedure on complicated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pointwise estimation of multivariate density functions on known domains of arbitrary dimensions using nonparametric local polynomial estimators. Our method is highly flexible, as it applies to both simple domains, such as open connected sets, and more complicated domains that are not star-shaped around the point of estimation. This enables us to handle domains with sharp concavities, holes, and local pinches, such as polynomial sectors. Additionally, we introduce a data-driven selection rule based on the general ideas of Goldenshluger and Lepski. Our results demonstrate that the local polynomial estimators are minimax under a $L^2$ risk across a wide range of H\"older-type functional classes. In the adaptive case, we provide oracle inequalities and explicitly determine the convergence rate of our statistical procedure. Simulations on polynomial sectors show that our oracle estimates outperform those of the most popular alternative method, found in the sparr package for the R software. Our statistical procedure is implemented in an online R package which is readily accessible.</description>

      <title>Kernel Limit of Recurrent Neural Networks Trained on Ergodic Data Sequences</title>

Abstract: Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N \rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space, whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation. These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of the neural network grow to infinity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) scheme using the closed Newton-Cotes rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper enhances the accuracy of the one-dimensional fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) using the closed Newton Cotes quadrature rules. Given the weights generated by the Composite Newton Cotes rules of order QN, it is shown that a FRFT of a QN-long weighted sequence can be written as two composites of FRFTs. The first composite of FRFTs is made up of a FRFT of a Q-long weighted sequence and a FRFT of a N-long sequence. The second composite is made up of a FRFT of a N-long weighted sequence and a FRFT of a Q-long sequence. The Empirical evidence suggests that the composite FRFTs has commutative property and works both algebraically and numerically. The composite of FRFTs is applied to the problem of inverting Fourier and Laplace transforms. The results show that the composite FRFTs outperforms both the simple non-weighted FRFT and the Newton-Cotes integration method, but the difference is less significant for the integration method.</description>

      <title>A Nordhaus--Gaddum problem for the spectral gap of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, with complement $\overline{G}$. The spectral gap of the transition probability matrix of a random walk on $G$ is used to estimate how fast the random walk becomes stationary. We prove that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Moreover, if all degrees are $\Omega(n)$ and $n-\Omega(n)$, then the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Theta(1)$. We also show that if the maximum degree is $n-O(1)$ or if $G$ is a join of two graphs, then the spectral gap of $G$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Finally, we provide a family of connected graphs with connected complements such that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $O(1/n^{3/4})$.</description>
