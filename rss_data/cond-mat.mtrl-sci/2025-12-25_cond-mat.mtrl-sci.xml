      <title>Applications of silicon carbide as window materials in atomic cells and atomic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.
  One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than
  1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we
  investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating
  anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide
  help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Inter-defect interactions, oxygen-vacancy distribution, and oxidation in acceptor-doped ABO3 perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.</description>

      <title>Bias, length, or coupling? What controls the quantum efficiency of electroluminescent single-polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards predictive atomistic simulations of SiC crystal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4{\deg} and 8{\deg} off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and semiconductor properties of NiGa2O4 spinel for Ga2O3/NiO interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unintentionally formed interfacial layers are ubiquitous in semiconductor devices that operate at extreme conditions. However, these layers' structure and properties often remain unknown due to the thinness of these naturally formed interphases. Here, we report on the intentional epitaxial growth and semiconductor properties of NiGa2O4 spinel layers that form at Ga2O3/NiO interfaces used in high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. Cubic spinel NiGa2O4 films of 10-50 nm thicknesses and low surface roughness (~ 2 nm) were grown using pulsed laser deposition at a substrate temperatures in the 300-900 {\deg}C range on {\alpha}-Al2O3 and {\beta}-Ga2O3 substrates of different orientation. The optical absorption onset (3.6-3.9 eV) and thermal conductivity (4-9 W m-1 K-1) vary systematically with substrate temperature, consistent with theoretical predictions of varying Ni and Ga cation ordering on the spinel lattice. The valence band offset between NiGa2O4 and {\beta}-Ga2O3 is determined to be 1.8 eV. The NiGa2O4-based p-n heterojunction devices on Ga2O3 (001) substrates exhibit a rectification ratio of 10^8 (for +/-2V) and a turn-on voltage of 1.4 V, maintaining diode behavior up to 600 {\deg}C. These results highlight the potential of NiGa2O4 as a p-type interlayer in Ga2O3-based devices and shows a new approach to investigate such interfacial layers.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Charge Transfer and Electronic Structure Modulation in Ultrathin Graphene P3HT Hybrid Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin polymer-graphene heterostructures are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies, while the influence of the polymer's structural variation on interfacial charge transfer remains unclear. Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>A voltage-responsive strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin network with emergent dynamics for computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent behavior,which arises from local interactions between simple elements,is pervasive in nature. It underlies the exceptional energy-efficient computing in our brains. However,realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge.Here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients,i.e.strong dipolar coupling enabled by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, the largest reported to date, and a disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks calibrated to experiments, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, which are characteristic of strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions.It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable,low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the lattice vibrational behaviors of CuInP2S6 by angle-resolved polarized Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Approach to Collective Excitations in Excitonic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Realization of Insulating Buffer Layers via MOCVD-Grown Nitrogen-Doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MOCVD-grown, nitrogen-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films as an insulating buffer layer on Fe-doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates in lieu of 49% HF treatment to remove unintentional silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface. N-doped layer thickness and NH3 flow were systematically varied to experimentally determine the lowest nitrogen concentration and thickness of the buffer layer needed to fully compensate the interfacial silicon peak. The NH3 molar flow rate was varied from 200 sccm to 1800 sccm. Results showed fully insulating N-doped layers for samples with NH3 flow rates greater than or equal to 1200 sccm and a thickness of 50 nm. This study demonstrates the efficacy of in-situ, controllably doped nitrogen buffer layers as a mitigation method for unintentional interfacial silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface.</description>

      <title>From cluster to nanocrystal: the continuous evolution and critical size of copper clusters revealed by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 &lt;= N &lt;= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N &lt; 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N &gt; 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 &lt;= N &lt;= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Guided Computational Discovery of 2D Materials with Large Spin Hall Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic interface engineering of spin-charge conversion in RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.</description>

Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moir\'e resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account.</description>

      <title>Features of the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Heusler Alloys in the States of a Half-Metallic Ferromagnet and a Spin-Gapless Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The review treats Heusler alloys that display distinctive functional properties, including shape-memory behavior and magnetocaloric effects. Particular emphasis is placed on Heusler systems in which half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-gapless semiconductor state are realized. Although these compounds are crystallographically rather "ordinary", peculiarities of their electronic structure and magnetic state lead to unconventional kinetic and magnetic properties. Their magnetic and transport characteristics are highly sensitive to external stimuli, and changes in alloy composition or external parameters can induce transitions between the states considered. This tunability provides further opportunities for controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler alloys and for exploiting them in applications such as spintronics and micro- and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench</description>

      <title>Adhesion Energy of Phosphorene on different pristine and oxidized metallic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black phosphorus and its single-layer constituent, phosphorene, have emerged as promising two-dimensional materials with remarkable tribological properties. However, recent experimental investigations reveal complex substrate-dependent behavior that affects their lubricating capabilities. This computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these fundamental interactions with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent black phosphorus lubricating properties, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion.</description>

      <title>Channel-last gate-all-around nanosheet oxide semiconductor transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we move beyond the era of transistor miniaturization, back-end-of-line-compatible transistors that can be stacked monolithically in the third dimension promise improved performance for low-power electronics. In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($&gt;$ 1 mA/$\mu$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics for organic mixed conductors: phase transitions in a lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic mixed conductors (OMCs) represent a promising class of materials for applications in bioelectronics, physical computing, and thermoelectrics. Rather unparalleled, OMCs feature dynamics spanning multiple length and time scales, involving an intricate coupling between electronic, ionic, and mass transport. These characteristics set them notably apart from traditional semiconductors and hinder the description by conventional semiconductor theory. In this work, we approach the charge carrier modulation of OMCs using statistical mechanics. We discuss OMCs from a first-principles perspective and contrast them with established semiconductor materials, highlighting key differences in their collective charge carrier dynamics. This motivates our toy model describing OMCs as a lattice gas, which we analyze within the grand canonical ensemble. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition analogous to a classical vapor$\unicode{x2013}$liquid transition, governed by temperature and chemical potential. In doing so, it explains the formation of distinct low- and high-density carrier phases $\unicode{x2013}$ a mesoscale phenomenon recently observed experimentally. It also demonstrates how metastability near the phase boundary can give rise to history-dependent characteristics in device operation, a similarly well-reported effect in OMC transistors. This work is intended as a simple motivation for studying OMCs through the lens of statistical mechanics, offering a more natural description than traditional semiconductor models developed for materials of fundamentally distinct character.</description>

      <title>Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description>

      <title>Drastic field-induced resistivity upturns as signatures of unconventional magnetism in superconducting iron chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic scattering is a powerful tool to identify underlying changes in electronic behavior and incipient electronic and magnetic orders. The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.</description>

      <title>Photoexcitation of moir\'e-trapped interlayer excitons via chiral phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor heterobilayers enable the quantum confinement of interlayer excitons with large out-of-plane permanent electric dipoles and spin-valley control. Here, we report a novel phonon-assisted excitation mechanism of individual moir\'e-trapped interlayer excitons in 2H-stacked MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers via chiral $E^{\prime\prime}$ in-plane optical phonons at the {\Gamma}-point. This excitation pathway preserves valley-selective optical selection rules and enables deterministic generation of individual interlayer excitons with defined helicity, emitting within a spectrally narrow energy spread. Through photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy in both the ensemble and quantum emitter regimes, we identify a fixed phonon energy of $\sim$23 meV mediating the process. First-principles calculations corroborate the symmetry and energy of the relevant phonon mode and its coupling to interlayer excitons, providing microscopic support for the observed valley-selective phonon-assisted excitation mechanism. Our results highlight the utility of chiral phonons as a tool for controlled excitation of quantum emitters in TMD moir\'e systems, opening new opportunities for valleytronic and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic sampling of materials using neutral-atom quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.</description>

      <title>MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen trapping in sub-stoichiometric niobium and vanadium carbide precipitates in high-strength steels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-strength steel is a structural metal crucial for load-bearing components yet is known to be highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) containing precipitated carbides introduce strong hydrogen traps to immobilize hydrogen, thus mitigating HE. However, variations in intrinsic vacancy concentrations in these carbides affect hydrogen thermodynamics and kinetics but remain poorly understood. Employing first-principles calculations, hydrogen trapping and diffusion in V/Nb carbides were investigated. Hydrogen dissolution energies are composition-dependent, revealing a transition from reversible to irreversible trapping with increasing carbon vacancy content, prescribed by the strength of covalent bonds with neighboring V/Nb atoms. Meanwhile, the diffusion energy barrier decreases with increasing carbon vacancy content, attributed to changes in vacancy patterns within carbides. The findings contribute new and critical knowledge for understanding hydrogen trapping and diffusion in sub-stoichiometric V/Nb carbides, providing valuable guidance for process and composition innovation of high-strength alloy steels for better HE resistance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a unique multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90\degree$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens other avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Directional atomic layer etching of MgO-doped lithium niobate using Br-based plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.</description>

      <title>Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys as candidate materials for spintronic and microelectronic applications: Electronic structure, transport, and magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Obstructed Cooper Pairs in Line-Graph Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping a Mott insulator is widely expected to produce mobile Cooper pairs whose kinetic energy sets the superfluid stiffness. Here we demonstrate a striking counterexample. We show that when doped charges propagate on the line-graph of a lattice with strong pairing interaction, they bind into obstructed Cooper pairs whose motion is frustrated by destructive interference. As a result, the leading-order pair kinetic energy vanishes identically in the strong-coupling expansion, producing a flat bosonic band of compact localised pair states and a vanishing superfluid stiffness at leading order. The low-energy Hilbert space is dominated by these localised pairs, yielding an extensively degenerate ground-state manifold and a superfluid stiffness that vanishes anomalously as the third inverse power of the pairing strength. At quarter filling, the frustrated pair dynamics maps onto a quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, realizing a d-wave resonating-valence-bond spin liquid with topological ground-state degeneracy and deconfined holon excitations. Our results establish a disorder-free mechanism for interaction-driven localization, in which strong pairing collapses the kinetic energy of Cooper pairs.</description>

Abstract: We consider a rhombohedral-stacked $N$-layer graphene coupled to a monolayer of Haldane model. We show that high order Dirac points in multilayer graphene can be gapped out by topological proximity effect of the Haldane model layer, leading to total Chern number $|C|=N+1$ quantum anomalous Hall states. This provides a new way to construct high Chern number quantum anomalous Hall states in realistic crystalline graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</description>

      <title>When Energy and Information Revolutions Meet 2D Janus</title>

Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in large-angle twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. Particularly for magnetism, their modular chemistry enables extensive control over magnetic interactions, spin magnitudes, lattice geometries, and even light-responsiveness, making them a uniquely adaptable platform. However, despite their promise, their low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we believe that MOFs and particularly magnetic MOFs offer a vast and largely untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>

Abstract: Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc&lt;TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc&gt;TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.</description>
