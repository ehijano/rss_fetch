      <title>Electroactive morphing effects on the aerodynamic performance through wobulation around an A320 wing with vibrating trailing edge at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effects of electroactive morphing on a 70cm chord A320 wing by means of near trailing edge slight deformation and vibration. Wing morphing is performed by Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) mini-piezoelectric actuators distributed along the span of the ''Reduced Scale'' (RS) A320 prototype of the H2020 No 723402 European research project SMS, ''Smart Morphing and Sensing for aeronautical configurations'', (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723402 and www.smartwing.org/SMS/EU). The configuration studied corresponds to a low-subsonic regime (Mach number 0.063) with a 10 degree incidence and a Reynolds number of 1 Million. The numerical simulations are carried out with the Navier-Stokes Multi-Block (NSMB) solver, which takes into account the deformation of the rear part of the wing implemented experimentally with the piezoelectric actuators. A detailed physical analysis of the morphing effects on the wake dynamics and on the aerodynamic performance is conducted with a constant amplitude of 0.7cm over a wide range of actuation frequencies [10-600]Hz. Optimal vibration ranges of [180-192]Hz and [205-215]Hz were found to respectively provide a 1% drag reduction and a 2% lift-to-drag ratio increase compared to the non-morphing (static) configuration. The natural frequencies associated with the shear layer Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices and the Von-Karman (VK) vortex shedding were found to play a central role in the modification of the wake dynamics by morphing as well as in the increase of the aerodynamic performance. Actuating at (or close to) the upper shear layer (USL) natural frequency (~185Hz) provides an order of 1% drag reduction and 1% lift-to-drag ratio increase, while actuating at (or close to) the lower shear layer (LSL) natural frequency (~208Hz) provides an order of 8% lift increase and 2% lift-to-drag increase. Furthermore, the linear variation of the actuation frequency over time, called wobulation, was shown to have significant effects. This approach demonstrated, through an appropriate mapping, the ability to quickly and efficiently detect optimal constant actuation frequency ranges providing aerodynamic performance increase and simultaneously reducing the amplitude of the main instability modes.</description>

      <title>The Initial Mass Function as the Equilibrium State of a Variational Process: why the IMF cannot be sampled stochastically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) is often treated as a stochastic probability distribution, yet such an interpretation implies Poisson noise that is inconsistent with growing observational evidence. In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>
