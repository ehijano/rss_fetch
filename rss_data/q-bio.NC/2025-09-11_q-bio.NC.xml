      <title>Path to Intelligence: Measuring Similarity between Human Brain and Large Language Model Beyond Language Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like abilities in language-based tasks. While language is a defining feature of human intelligence, it emerges from more fundamental neurophysical processes rather than constituting the basis of intelligence itself. In this work, we study the similarity between LLM internal states and human brain activity in a sensory-motor task rooted in anticipatory and visuospatial behavior. These abilities are essential for cognitive performance that constitute human intelligence. We translate the sensory-motor task into natural language in order to replicate the process for LLMs. We extract hidden states from pre-trained LLMs at key time steps and compare them to human intracranial EEG signals. Our results reveal that LLM-derived reactions can be linearly mapped onto human neural activity. These findings suggest that LLMs, with a simple natural language translation to make them understand temporal-relevant tasks, can approximate human neurophysical behavior in experiments involving sensory stimulants. In all, our contribution is two-fold: (1) We demonstrate similarity between LLM and human brain activity beyond language-based tasks. (2) We demonstrate that with such similarity, LLMs could help us understand human brains by enabling us to study topics in neuroscience that are otherwise challenging to tackle.</description>

      <title>A novel cost-effective fabrication of a flexible neural probe for brain signal recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel, flexible, and implantable neural probe using a cost-effective microfabrication process based on a thin polyimide film. Polyimide film, known as Kapton, serves as a flexible substrate for microelectrodes, conductive tracks, and contact pads of the probe, which are made from a thin film of gold (Au). SU-8 is used to cover the corresponding tracks for electrical isolation and to increase the stiffness of the probe for better implantation. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and artificial neural signal recording have been used to characterize its properties. The microelectrode dimensions have been carefully chosen to provide low impedance characteristics, which are necessary for acquiring local field potential (LFP) signals. The in vivo LFP data have been obtained from a male zebra finch presented with auditory stimuli. By properly filtering the extracellular recordings and analyzing the data, the obtained results have been validated by comparing them with the signals acquired with a commercial neural electrode. Due to the use of Kapton, SU-8, and Au materials with non-toxic and adaptable properties in the body environment, the fabricated neural probe is considered a promising biocompatible implantable neural probe that may pave the way for the fabrication of other neural implantable devices with commercial aims.</description>

      <title>LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>
