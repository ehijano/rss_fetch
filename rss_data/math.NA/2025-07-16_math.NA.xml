      <title>Accelerating seismic inversion and uncertainty quantification with efficient high-rank Hessian approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient high-rank approximations of the Hessian can accelerate seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) and uncertainty quantification (UQ). In FWI, approximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for Newton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and improving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian approximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the efficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale problems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products, and performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave equations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank methods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We adapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread function method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building on an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that unifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic quadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that these high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational costs in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a low-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little meaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and underestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is overestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated using the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical information about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior variance.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Bi-degree $(d,d)$ Spline Spaces with the Highest Order of Smoothness over Hierarchical T-Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dimension of the spline space of di-degree $(d,d)$ with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical T-mesh $\mathscr T$ using the smoothing cofactor-conformality method. Firstly, we obtain a dimensional formula for the conformality vector space over a tensor product T-connected component. Then, we prove that the dimension of the conformality vector space over a T-connected component of a hierarchical T-mesh under the tensor product subdivision can be calculated in a recursive manner. Combining these two aspects, we obtain a dimensional formula for the bi-degree $(d,d)$ spline space with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical T-mesh $\mathscr T$ with mild assumption. Additionally, we provide a strategy to modify an arbitrary hierarchical T-mesh such that the dimension of the bi-degree $(d,d)$ spline space is stable over the modified hierarchical T-mesh. Finally, we prove that the dimension of the spline space over such a hierarchical T-mesh is the same as that of a lower-degree spline space over its CVR graph. Thus, the proposed solution can pave the way for the subsequent construction of basis functions for spline space over such a hierarchical T-mesh.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Active Flux Method in the Framework of Summation-by-Parts Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Flux method is a numerical method for conservation laws using a combination of cell averages and point values, based on ideas from finite volumes and finite differences. This unusual mix has been shown to work well in many situations. We expand the theoretical justifications of the Active Flux method by analyzing it from the point of view of summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, which are routinely used to analyze finite difference, finite volume, and finite element schemes. We show that the Active Flux method can be formulated using degenerate SBP operators, yielding a first and novel approach for showing the energy stability of the Active Flux method.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reduced Basis Trust Region Methods for Parabolic Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear inverse problems arising in the context of parameter identification for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a finite-volume scheme for aggregation-diffusion equations with saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Bailo, Carrillo, Hu. SIAM J. Appl. Math. 2023] the authors introduce a finite-volume method for aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear mobility. In this paper we prove convergence of this method using an Aubin--Simons compactness theorem due to Gallou\"et and Latch\'e. We use suitable discrete $H^1$ and $W^{-1,1}$ discrete norms. We provide two convergence results. A first result shows convergence with general entropies ($U$) (including singular and degenerate) if the initial datum does not have free boundaries, the mobility is Lipschitz, and the confinement ($V$) and aggregation ($K$) potentials are $W^{2,\infty}_0$. A second result shows convergence when the initial datum has free boundaries, mobility is just continuous, and $V$ and $K$ are $W^{1,\infty}$, but under the assumption that the entropy $U$ is $C^1$ and strictly convex.</description>

      <title>Adaptive FEM with explicit time integration for the wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a recent a posteriori error estimator for the finite element solution of the wave equation with explicit time-stepping [Grote, Lakkis, Santos, 2024], we devise a space-time adaptive strategy which includes both time evolving meshes and local time-stepping [Diaz, Grote, 2009] to overcome any overly stringent CFL stability restriction on the time-step due to local mesh refinement. Moreover, at each time-step the adaptive algorithm monitors the accuracy thanks to the error indicators and recomputes the current step on a refined mesh until the desired tolerance is met; meanwhile, the mesh is coarsened in regions of smaller errors. Leapfrog based local time-stepping is applied in all regions of local mesh refinement to incorporate adaptivity into fully explicit time integration with mesh change while retaining efficiency. Numerical results illustrate the optimal rate of convergence of the a posteriori error estimators on time evolving meshes.</description>

      <title>On maximal curves of $n$-correct sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathcal{X}$ is an $n$-correct set of nodes in the plane, that is, it admits a unisolvent interpolation with bivariate polynomials of total degree less than or equal to $n.$ Then an algebraic curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ can pass through at most $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\Xset,$ where $d(n,k)={{n+2}\choose {2}}-{{n+2-k}\choose {2}}.$ A curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ is called maximal if it passes through exactly $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ In particular, a maximal line is a line passing through $d(n,1)=n+1$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ Maximal curves are an important tool for the study of $n$-correct sets. We present new properties of maximal curves, as well as extensions of known properties.</description>

      <title>GALDS: A Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate model to predict neurite material transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport. Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum relative error &lt;8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to previous surrogate model approaches.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Time Derivatives of the Equations of Motion of Rigid Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots, and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>Performance Enhancement of the Recursive Least Squares Algorithms with Rank Two Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New recursive least squares algorithms with rank two updates (RLSR2) that include both exponential and instantaneous forgetting (implemented via a proper choice of the forgetting factor and the window size) are introduced and systematically associated in this report with well-known RLS algorithms with rank one updates. Moreover, new properties (which can be used for further performance improvement) of the recursive algorithms associated with the convergence of the inverse of information matrix and parameter vector are established in this report. The performance of new algorithms is examined in the problem of estimation of the grid events in the presence of significant harmonic emissions.</description>

      <title>Energy Balance and Optical Theorem for Time-Modulated Subwavelength Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave propagation through a one-dimensional array of subwavelength resonators with periodically time-modulated material parameters. Focusing on a high-contrast regime, we use a scattering framework based on Fourier expansions and scattering matrix techniques to capture the interactions between an incident wave and the temporally varying system. This way, we derive a formulation of the total energy flux corresponding to time-dependent systems of resonators. We show that the total energy flux is composed of the transmitted and reflected energy fluxes, and derive an optical theorem which characterises the energy balance of the system. We provide a number of numerical experiments to investigate the impact of the time-dependency, the operating frequency and the number of resonators on the maximal attainable energy gain and energy loss. Moreover, we show the existence of lasing points, at which the total energy diverges. Our results lay the foundation for the design of energy dissipative or energy amplifying systems.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Characterizations of Tilt Stability in Composite Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilt stability is a fundamental concept of variational analysis and optimization that plays a pivotal role in both theoretical issues and numerical computations. This paper investigates tilt stability of local minimizers for a general class of composite optimization problems in finite dimensions, where extended-real-valued objectives are compositions of parabolically regular and smooth functions. Under the weakest metric subregularity constraint qualification and other verifiable conditions, we establish unified neighborhood and pointbased characterizations of tilt stability via second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for further developments on variational stability and numerical algorithms of optimization and related topics.</description>

      <title>Effects of rough boundary and nonzero boundary conditions on the lubrication process with micropolar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lubrication theory is mostly concerned with the behavior of a lubricant flowing through a narrow gap. Motivated by the experimental findings from the tribology literature, we take the lubricant to be micropolar fluid and study its behavior in a thin domain with rough boundary. Instead of considering (commonly used) simple zero boundary condition, we impose physically relevant (nonzero) boundary condition for microrotation and perform asymptotic analysis of the corresponding 3D boundary value problem. We formally derive a simplified mathematical model acknowledging the roughness-induced effects and the effects of the nonzero boundary conditions on the macroscopic flow. Using the obtained asymptotic model, we study numerically the influence of the specific rugosity profile on the performance of a linear slider bearing. The numerical results clearly indicate that the use of the rough surfaces may contribute to enhance the mechanical performance of such device.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pointwise Statistics in Hyperbolic Equations with Random Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</description>

      <title>The Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund Property for Riemann Differences with Geometric Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when a Riemann difference of order $ n $ possesses the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) property: that is, whether the conditions $ f(h) = o(h^{n-1}) $ and $ Df(h) = o(h^n) $ imply $ f(h) = o(h^n) $. This implication is known to hold for some classical examples with geometric nodes, such as $ \{0, 1, q, \dots, q^{n-1}\} $ and $ \{1, q, \dots, q^n\} $, leading to a conjecture that these are the only such Riemann differences with the MZ property. However, this conjecture was disproved by the third-order example with nodes $ \{-1, 0, 1, 2\} $, and we provide further counterexamples and a general classification here.
  We establish a complete analytic criterion for the MZ property by developing a recurrence framework: we analyze when a function $ R(h) $ satisfying $ D(h) = R(qh) - A R(h) $, together with $ D(h) = o(h^n) $ and $ R(h) = o(h^{n-1}) $, forces $ R(h) = o(h^n) $. We prove that this holds if and only if $ A $ lies outside a critical modulus annulus determined by $ q $ and $ n $, covering both $ |q| &gt; 1 $ and $ |q| &lt; 1 $ cases. This leads to a complete characterization of all Riemann differences with geometric nodes that possess the MZ property, and provides a flexible analytic framework applicable to broader classes of generalized differences.</description>

      <title>Scaling the memory wall using mixed-precision -- HPG-MxP on an exascale machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision algorithms have been proposed as a way for scientific computing to benefit from some of the gains seen for artificial intelligence (AI) on recent high performance computing (HPC) platforms. A few applications dominated by dense matrix operations have seen substantial speedups by utilizing low precision formats such as FP16. However, a majority of scientific simulation applications are memory bandwidth limited. Beyond preliminary studies, the practical gain from using mixed-precision algorithms on a given HPC system is largely unclear.
  The High Performance GMRES Mixed Precision (HPG-MxP) benchmark has been proposed to measure the useful performance of a HPC system on sparse matrix-based mixed-precision applications. In this work, we present a highly optimized implementation of the HPG-MxP benchmark for an exascale system and describe our algorithm enhancements. We show for the first time a speedup of 1.6x using a combination of double- and single-precision on modern GPU-based supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Recursive Bound-Constrained AdaGrad with Applications to Multilevel and Domain Decomposition Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training, illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semi and fully-discrete analysis of lowest-order nonstandard finite element methods for the biharmonic wave problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses lowest-order nonstandard finite element methods for space discretization and explicit and implicit schemes for time discretization of the biharmonic wave equation with clamped boundary conditions. A modified Ritz projection operator defined on $H^2_0(\Omega)$ ensures error estimates under appropriate regularity assumptions on the solution. Stability results and error estimates of optimal order are established in suitable norms for the semidiscrete and explicit/implicit fully-discrete versions of the proposed schemes. Finally, we report on numerical experiments using explicit and implicit schemes for time discretization and Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and {C$^0$ interior} penalty schemes for space discretization, that validate the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</description>

      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Parallel subspace correction methods for semicoercive and nearly semicoercive convex optimization with applications to nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new convergence analyses for parallel subspace correction methods for unconstrained semicoercive and nearly semicoercive convex optimization problems, generalizing the theory of singular and nearly singular linear problems to a class of nonlinear problems. Our results demonstrate that the elegant theoretical framework developed for singular and nearly singular linear problems can be extended to unconstrained semicoercive and nearly semicoercive convex optimization problems. For semicoercive problems, we show that the convergence rate can be estimated in terms of a seminorm stable decomposition over the subspaces and the kernel of the problem, aligning with the theory for singular linear problems. For nearly semicoercive problems, we establish a parameter-independent convergence rate, assuming the kernel of the semicoercive part can be decomposed into a sum of local kernels, which aligns with the theory for nearly singular problems. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we provide convergence analyses of two-level additive Schwarz methods for solving certain nonlinear partial differential equations with Neumann boundary conditions, within the proposed abstract framework.</description>

      <title>Error estimation for quasi-Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling can attain far better accuracy than plain Monte Carlo sampling. However, with plain Monte Carlo sampling it is much easier to estimate the attained accuracy. This article describes methods old and new to quantify the error in quasi-Monte Carlo estimates. An important challenge in this setting is that the goal of getting accuracy conflicts with that of estimating the attained accuracy. A related challenge is that rigorous uncertainty quantifications can be extremely conservative. A recent surprise is that some RQMC estimates have nearly symmetric distributions and that has the potential to allow confidence intervals that do not require either a central limit theorem or a consistent variance estimate.</description>

      <title>Discretization error analysis for a radially symmetric harmonic map heat flow problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the harmonic map heat flow problem for a radially symmetric case. The corresponding partial dfferential equation plays a key role in many analyses of harmonic map heat flow problems. We consider a basic discretization method for this problem, namely a second order finite difference discretization in space combined with a semi-implicit Euler method in time. The semi-implicit Euler method results in a linear problem in each time step. We restrict to the regime of smooth solutions of the continuous problem and present an error analysis of this discretization method. This results in optimal order discretization error bounds (apart from a logarithmic term). We also present discrete energy estimates that mimic the decrease of the energy of the continuous solution.</description>

      <title>The Akhiezer iteration and inverse-free solvers for Sylvester matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two inverse-free iterative methods are developed for solving Sylvester matrix equations when the spectra of the coefficient matrices are on, or near, known disjoint subintervals of the real axis. Both methods use the recently-introduced Akhiezer iteration: one to address an equivalent problem of approximating the matrix sign function applied to a block matrix and the other to directly approximate the inverse of the Sylvester operator. In each case this results in provable and computable geometric rates of convergence. When the right-hand side matrix is low rank, both methods require only low-rank matrix-matrix products. Relative to existing approaches, the methods presented here can be more efficient and require less storage when the coefficient matrices are dense or otherwise costly to invert. Applications include solving partial differential equations and computing Fr\'echet derivatives.</description>

      <title>Comparison of FMM and $\mathcal{H}$-matrix based 3D-ACA for a time domain boundary element method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for the homogeneous wave equation with vanishing initial conditions is considered. For the temporal discretisation, the generalized convolution quadrature method (gCQ) developed by Lopez-Fernandez and Sauter is used. The spatial discretisation is done classically using low-order shape functions.
  Essentially, the gCQ requires to establish boundary element matrices of the corresponding elliptic problem in Laplace domain at several complex frequencies. Consequently, an array of system matrices is obtained. This array of system matrices can be interpreted as a three-dimensional array of data which should be approximated by a data-sparse representation, for which the generalised Adaptive Cross Approximation (3D-ACA) can be applied. The rank of the three-dimensional data array is increased adaptively until a prescribed accuracy is obtained. On a pure algebraic level, it is decided whether a low-rank approximation of the three-dimensional data array is close enough to the original matrix. Within the data slices corresponding to the BEM calculations for each frequency, either the standard $\mathcal{H}$-matrices approach with ACA or a fast multipole (FMM) approach can be used. The third dimension of the data array represents the complex frequencies. Hence, the algorithm does not only sparsify the data array in the two spatial dimensions but also adaptively detects how much frequencies are necessary for which matrix block.
  he two versions, either using ACA or FMM within the slices, are briefly discussed. The main contribution of this paper is a comparison of both with respect to savings in storage and computing time. The example of the sound scattering of an electric machine shows that both techniques allow to utilise a time-domain BEM in real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Coverage errors for Student's t confidence intervals comparable to those in Hall (1988)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Table 1 of Hall (1988) contains asymptotic coverage error formulas for some nonparametric approximate 95\% confidence intervals for the mean based on $n$ IID samples. The table includes an entry for an interval based on the central limit theorem using Gaussian quantiles and the Gaussian maximum likelihood variance estimate. It is missing an entry for the very widely used Student's $t$ confidence intervals. This note develops such a formula. The impetus to revisit this issue arose from the surprisingly robust performance of confidence intervals based on Student's t statistic in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. Hall's table had $0.14\kappa -2.12\gamma^2-3.35$ for normal theory intervals; the corresponding entry for Student's $t$ is $0.14\kappa -2.12\gamma^2$.
  An earlier version of this note reported that it corrected some coverage error formulas in Hall (1988). Two-sided errors take the form $2\Phi^{-1}(0.975)(A\kappa + \gamma^2+C)\varphi(1.96)/n +O(1/n^{3/2})$ where the error may well be $O(n^{-2})$. Hall's table showed $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)(A\kappa + B\gamma^2+C)$. The version intended as a correction had $2(A\kappa + B\gamma^2+C)$, wider by about $2/1.96\doteq1.02$. So, Hall's table really is proportional to the two-sided coverage errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</description>
