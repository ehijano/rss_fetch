      <title>Greedy Multi-Path Block Verification for Faster Decoding in Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of $L$-step speculative decoding is to accelerate autoregressive decoding of a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a candidate path of $L$ tokens. Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for STAR-RIS-enhanced Metaverse Systems with Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR)-enabled Metaverse is a promising technique to provide immersive service experience for mobile users. However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a geometric duality between the spherical squared-Hellinger distance and a hyperbolic isometric invariant of the Poincare disc under the action of the general Mobius group. Motivated by the geometric connection, we propose the usage of the L2-embedded hyperbolic isometric invariant as an alternative way to quantify divergence between Gaussian measures as a contribution to information theory.</description>

      <title>Federated Latent Space Alignment for Multi-user Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning for effective task execution, but differing latent representations in AI-native devices can cause semantic mismatches that hinder mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigating latent space misalignment in multi-agent AI- native semantic communications. In a downlink scenario, we consider an access point (AP) communicating with multiple users to accomplish a specific AI-driven task. Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides. Numerical results validate the proposed approach in goal-oriented semantic communication, revealing key trade-offs among accuracy, com- munication overhead, complexity, and the semantic proximity of AI-native communication devices.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Scale: A Novel Transform for NMR Envelope Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envelope extraction in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental step for processing the data space generated by this technique. Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part I: Traffic-Aware Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part II: Geometry-Aware Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Channel Matrix Optimization for Holevo Bound Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication holds the potential to revolutionize information transmission by enabling secure data exchange that exceeds the limits of classical systems. One of the key performance metrics in quantum information theory, namely the Holevo bound, quantifies the amount of classical information that can be transmitted reliably over a quantum channel. However, computing and optimizing the Holevo bound remains a challenging task due to its dependence on both the quantum input ensemble and the quantum channel. In order to maximize the Holevo bound, we propose a unified projected gradient ascent algorithm to optimize the quantum channel given a fixed input ensemble. We provide a detailed complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantum channel optimization yields higher Holevo bounds than input ensemble optimization.</description>

      <title>Tight any-shot quantum decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, underlying various applications in quantum physics. We prove a novel one-shot decoupling theorem formulated in terms of quantum relative entropy distance, with the decoupling error bounded by two sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropies. In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime.
  Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-R\'enyi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-R\'enyi coherent informations. We further prove that these achievable bounds are tight for maximally correlated states and generalized dephasing channels, respectively, for the high distillation-rate/coding-rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Support Recovery and $\ell_2$-Error Bound for Sparse Regression with Quadratic Measurements via Weakly-Convex-Concave Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of unknown signals from quadratic measurements finds extensive applications in fields such as phase retrieval, power system state estimation, and unlabeled distance geometry. This paper investigates the finite sample properties of weakly convex--concave regularized estimators in high-dimensional quadratic measurements models. By employing a weakly convex--concave penalized least squares approach, we establish support recovery and $\ell_2$-error bounds for the local minimizer. To solve the corresponding optimization problem, we adopt two proximal gradient strategies, where the proximal step is computed either in closed form or via a weighted $\ell_1$ approximation, depending on the regularization function. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>MARS: Margin-Aware Reward-Modeling with Self-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize information as risk reduction between knowledge states represented by partitions of the underlying probability space. Entropy corresponds to risk reduction from no (or partial) knowledge to full knowledge about a random variable, while information corresponds to risk reduction from no (or partial) knowledge to partial knowledge. This applies to any information measure that is based on expected loss minimization, such as Bregman information, with Shannon information and variance as prominent examples. In each case, fundamental properties like the chain rule, non-negativity, and the relationship between information and divergence are preserved. Because partitions form a lattice under refinement, our general treatment reveals how information can be decomposed into redundant, unique, and synergistic contributions, a question important in applications from neuroscience to machine learning, yet one for which existing formulations lack consensus on foundational definitions and can violate basic properties such as the chain rule or non-negativity. Redundancy corresponds to Aumann's common knowledge, synergy to the gap between separately and jointly observed sources, and unique information is necessarily path-dependent, taking different values depending on what is already known. The resulting partial information decomposition is grounded directly in probability theory, avoids treating scalar information quantities as primitive compositional objects, and yields non-negative terms by construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a class of divergences measuring the difference between probability density functions on the one-dimensional sample space. This divergence is a one-parameter variation of the Itakura--Saito divergence between quantile density functions. We prove that the proposed divergence is a one-parameter variation of the transport Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hessian distance of negative Boltzmann entropy with respect to the Wasserstein-$2$ metric. From Taylor expansions, we also formulate the $3$-symmetric tensor in Wasserstein-$2$ space, which is given by an iterative Gamma three operator. The alpha--geodesic on Wasserstein space is also derived. From these properties, we name the proposed divergences transport alpha divergences. We provide several examples of transport alpha divergences on one dimensional distributions, such as generative models and Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Uplink Covert Communication in MIMO GEO Satellite-Terrestrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the uplink covert communication in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite-terrestrial system consisting of an Earth station transmitter Alice, a geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellite receiver Bob, and multiple GEO satellite wardens around Bob, where each node in the system is equipped with an array of directional antennas. Based on beamforming and the default antenna orientation setting, we first propose a scheme for covert Alice-Bob uplink transmission. Under the perfect channel estimation scenario, we provide theoretical modeling for the system performance in terms of detection error probability (DEP), transmission outage probability (TOP) and covert rate (CR), and then explore the optimal beamforming (OB) design as well as the joint optimal beamforming and antenna orientation (JO-BA) design for CR maximization. We then extend our study to the imperfect channel estimation scenario, and conduct related performance modeling and OB/JO-BA designs for CR maximization. We also apply the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, alternating optimization, Rodrigues' rotation formula and 1-D search algorithm to develop efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problems. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical results and to illustrate the efficiency of beamforming and antenna orientation design for supporting the uplink covert communication in MIMO GEO satellite-terrestrial systems.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Lossless Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new framework is introduced for examining and evaluating the fundamental limits of lossless data compression, that emphasizes genuinely non-asymptotic results. The {\em sample complexity} of compressing a given source is defined as the smallest blocklength at which it is possible to compress that source at a specified rate and to within a specified excess-rate probability. This formulation parallels corresponding developments in statistics and computer science, and it facilitates the use of existing results on the sample complexity of various hypothesis testing problems. For arbitrary sources, the sample complexity of general variable-length compressors is shown to be tightly coupled with the sample complexity of prefix-free codes and fixed-length codes. For memoryless sources, it is shown that the sample complexity is characterized not by the source entropy, but by its R\'{e}nyi entropy of order~$1/2$. Nonasymptotic bounds on the sample complexity are obtained, with explicit constants. Generalizations to Markov sources are established, showing that the sample complexity is determined by the source's R\'{e}nyi entropy rate of order~$1/2$. Finally, bounds on the sample complexity of universal data compression are developed for arbitrary families of memoryless sources. There, the sample complexity is characterized by the minimum R\'{e}nyi divergence of order~$1/2$ between elements of the family and the uniform distribution. The connection of this problem with identity testing and with the associated separation rates is explored and discussed.</description>

      <title>Achievability Bounds of Coding with Finite Blocklength for Gaussian Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the achievable performance of dirty paper coding for the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) with finite blocklength and we propose two different achievability bounds for this problem. We present the broadcast adaptation of dependence testing bound of Polyanskiy et al. 2010, which is an upper bound on the average error probability that depends on the channel dispersion terms of each error event for fixed input. Additionally, we introduce the $\kappa \beta$ lower bounds on the maximal code sizes of each user using dirty paper coding.</description>

      <title>Classical Feedback in a Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication over a quantum multiple access channel (MAC) is considered with classical feedback. Since the no-cloning prohibits universal copying of arbitrary quantum states, classical feedback is generated through measurement. An achievable rate region is derived using partial information decoding at each transmitter. Our region generalizes both the classical Cover-Leung region and the generalized feedback region. As an example, we show that the qubit SWAP channel can benefit from feedback.</description>
