      <title>Conditional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the classic paper by Chellas "Basic conditional logic" (1975), we propose a general algebraic framework for studying a binary operation of conditional that models universal features of the "if..., then..." connective as strictly related to the unary modal necessity operator. To this end, we introduce a variety of conditional algebras, and we develop its duality and canonical extensions theory.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic Quantum Logic Perspective: A New Approach to Natural Revision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical belief revision framework proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson involves the revision of a theory based on eight postulates. This paper focuses on exploring the revision theory based on quantum mechanics, known as the natural revision theory. In quantum systems, there are two reasoning modes: static intuitionistic reasoning, which incorporates contextuality, and dynamic reasoning, which is achieved through projection measurement.
  We combine the advantages of the two intuitionistic quantum logics proposed by Doering and Coecke respectively. We aim to provide a truth-value assignment for intuitionistic quantum logic that not only aligns with the characteristics of quantum mechanics but also allows for truth-value reasoning. We investigate the natural revision theory based on this approach.
  We introduce two types of revision operators corresponding to the two reasoning modes in quantum systems: object-level revision and operator-level revision, and we highlight the distinctions between these two operators. Unlike classical revision, we consider the revision of consequence relations in intuitionistic quantum logic. We demonstrate that, within the framework of the natural revision theory, both types of revision operators work together on the reasoning system of consequence relations. The outcomes of revision process are influenced by the order in which the interweaved operators are applied.</description>

      <title>The construction principle and non homogeneity of uncountable relatively free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [11] Sklinos proved that any uncountable free group is not $\aleph_1$-homogenenous. This was later generalized by Belegradek in [1] to torsion-free residually finite relatively free groups, leaving open whether the assumption of residual finiteness was necessary. In this paper we use methods arising from the classical analysis of relatively free groups in infinitary logic to answer Belegradek's question in the negative. Our methods are general and they also applications in varieties with torsion, for example we show that if $V$ contains a non-solvable group, then any uncountable $V$-free group is not $\aleph_1$-homogenenous.</description>

      <title>Wand/set theories: A realization of Conway's mathematicians' liberation movement, with an application to Church's set theory with a universal set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a variant of the usual story about the iterative conception of sets. As usual, at every stage, you find all the (bland) sets of objects which you found earlier. But you also find the result of tapping any earlier-found object with any magic wand (from a given stock of magic wands).
  By varying the number and behaviour of the wands, we can flesh out this idea in many different ways. This paper's main Theorem is that any loosely constructive way of fleshing out this idea is synonymous with a ZF-like theory.
  This Theorem has rich applications; it realizes John Conway's (1976) Mathematicians' Liberation Movement; and it connects with a lovely idea due to Alonzo Church (1974).</description>

      <title>The calculus of names -- The legacy of Jan {\L}ukasiewicz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With his research on Aristotelian syllogistic, Jan {\L}ukasiewicz (1929; 1934; 1939; 1951/57) initiated a branch of logic called the calculus of names. This section deals with axiomatic systems that analyze various fragments of the logic of names, i.e., one that study various forms of names and functors acting on them, as well as logical relationships between sentences in which these names and functors occur. In this work, we want not only to present the genesis of the calculus of names and its first system created by {\L}ukasiewicz. We also want to deliver systems that extend the first. In this work, we will also show that, from the point of view of modern logic, {\L}ukasiewicz's approach to syllogistic is not the only possible one. However, this does not diminish {\L}ukasiewicz's role in the study of syllogism. We believe that the calculus of names is indisputably {\L}ukasiewicz's legacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give natural examples of $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$-complete and $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete sets.
  In the first part, we consider ideals on $\omega$. In particular, we show that the Hindman ideal $\mathcal{H}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete and consider a number of ideals generated in the similar fashion. Moreover, we show that the ideal $\mathcal{D}$ is also $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete.
  In the second part, we focus on families of trees (on $\omega$ and $2$). We show that the family of trees containing Silver trees in $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$-complete.</description>

      <title>Definable (co)homology, pro-torus rigidity, and (co)homological classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the classical homology theory of Steenrod may be enriched with descriptive set-theoretic information. We prove that the resulting definable homology theory provides a strictly finer invariant than Steenrod homology for compact metrizable spaces up to homotopy. In particular, we show that pro-tori are completely classified up to homeomorphism by their definable homology. This is in contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many pairwise non-homeomorphic solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We similarly develop a definable cohomology theory which strengthens \v{C}ech cohomology and we show that it completely classifies complements of pro-tori up to homeomorphism.
  We also apply definable cohomology theory to the study of the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions from a solenoid complement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg in 1936. It was proved by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1940 that the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is uncountable. We will strengthen this result, by showing that each orbit of the canonical action $\mathrm{Homeo}% \left( X\right) \curvearrowright \left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is countable, and hence that such an action has uncountably many orbits. This can be seen as a rigidity result, and will be deduced from a rigidity result for definable automorphisms of the \v{C}ech cohomology of $X$. We will also show that these results still hold if one replaces solenoids with pro-tori.
  We conclude by applying the machinery developed herein to bound the Borel complexity of several well-studied classification problems in mathematics, such as that of automorphisms of continuous-trace $C^{*}$-algebras up to unitary equivalence, or that of Hermitian line bundles, up to isomorphism, over a locally compact second countable space.</description>

      <title>Groups Acting Generically Multiply Transitively on Solvable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we complete the classification of generically multiply transitive actions of groups on solvable groups in the finite Morley rank setting. We prove that if $G$ is a connected group of finite Morley rank acting definably, faithfully and generically $m$-transitively on a connected solvable group $V$ of finite Morley rank where $\operatorname{rk}(V)\leqslant m$, then $\operatorname{rk}(V)=m$, $V$ is a vector space of dimension $m$ over an algebraically closed field $F$, $G\cong \operatorname{GL}_m(F)$, and the action is equivalent to the natural action of $\operatorname{GL}_m(F)$ on $F^m$. This generalises our previous work arXiv:2107.09997. As an application of our result, we classify definably primitive groups of finite Morley rank and affine type acting on a set $X$ with a generic transitivity degree of $\operatorname{rk}(X)+1$.</description>
