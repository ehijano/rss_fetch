      <title>Performance Analysis of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various TCP variants such as Reno, Tahoe, Vegas, SACK and so on. These variants implement algorithms that handle congestion control. In our experiments we have used these variants to measure their performance such as throughput, delay (latency), and drop rate with respect to time and Constant Bit Rate (CBR) - no congestion control, specified bandwidth and sends packets at a specified rate. We have used the NS2 network simulator to perform all our experiments to analyze TCP performance.</description>

      <title>On the use of Probabilistic Forecasting for Network Analysis in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike other single-point Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based prediction techniques, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), probabilistic forecasting techniques (e.g., DeepAR and Transformer) provide a range of possible outcomes and associated probabilities that enable decision makers to make more informed and robust decisions. At the same time, the architecture of Open RAN has emerged as a revolutionary approach for mobile networks, aiming at openness, interoperability and innovation in the ecosystem of RAN. In this paper, we propose the use of probabilistic forecasting techniques as a radio App (rApp) within the Open RAN architecture. We investigate and compare different probabilistic and single-point forecasting methods and algorithms to estimate the utilization and resource demands of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) of cellular base stations. Through our evaluations, we demonstrate the numerical advantages of probabilistic forecasting techniques over traditional single-point forecasting methods and show that they are capable of providing more accurate and reliable estimates. In particular, DeepAR clearly outperforms single-point forecasting techniques such as LSTM and Seasonal-Naive (SN) baselines and other probabilistic forecasting techniques such as Simple-Feed-Forward (SFF) and Transformer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cloud-Native Resource Allocation with Probabilistic Forecasting Techniques in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for intelligent and efficient resource provisioning for the productive management of resources in real-world scenarios is growing with the evolution of telecommunications towards the 6G era. Technologies such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) can help to build interoperable solutions for the management of complex systems. Probabilistic forecasting, in contrast to deterministic single-point estimators, can offer a different approach to resource allocation by quantifying the uncertainty of the generated predictions. This paper examines the cloud-native aspects of O-RAN together with the radio App (rApp) deployment options. The integration of probabilistic forecasting techniques as a rApp in O-RAN is also emphasized, along with case studies of real-world applications. Through a comparative analysis of forecasting models using the error metric, we show the advantages of Deep Autoregressive Recurrent network (DeepAR) over other deterministic probabilistic estimators. Furthermore, the simplicity of Simple-Feed-Forward (SFF) leads to a fast runtime but does not capture the temporal dependencies of the input data. Finally, we present some aspects related to the practical applicability of cloud-native O-RAN with probabilistic forecasting.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of PRB Load Uncertainty Forecasting for Sustainable Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures brings new challenges for resource management, especially in predicting the utilization of Physical Resource Block (PRB)s. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to characterize the PRB load using probabilistic forecasting techniques. First, we provide background information on the O-RAN architecture and components and emphasize the importance of energy/power consumption models for sustainable implementations. The problem statement highlights the need for accurate PRB load prediction to optimize resource allocation and power efficiency. We then investigate probabilistic forecasting techniques, including Simple-Feed-Forward (SFF), DeepAR, and Transformers, and discuss their likelihood model assumptions. The simulation results show that DeepAR estimators predict the PRBs with less uncertainty and effectively capture the temporal dependencies in the dataset compared to SFF- and Transformer-based models, leading to power savings. Different percentile selections can also increase power savings, but at the cost of over-/under provisioning. At the same time, the performance of the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is shown to be inferior to the probabilistic estimators with respect to all error metrics. Finally, we outline the importance of probabilistic, prediction-based characterization for sustainable O-RAN implementations and highlight avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Reasoning About Internet Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation in the Internet requires a global Internet core to enable communication between users in ISPs and services in the cloud. Today, this Internet core is challenged by partial reachability: political pressure threatens fragmentation by nationality, architectural changes such as carrier-grade NAT make connectivity conditional, and operational problems and commercial disputes make reachability incomplete for months. We assert that partial reachability is a fundamental part of the Internet core. While other studies address partial reachability, this paper is the first to provide a conceptual definition of the Internet core so we can reason about reachability from principles first. Following the Internet design, our definition is guided by reachability, not authority. Its corollaries are peninsulas: persistent regions of partial connectivity; and islands: when networks are partitioned from the Internet core. We show that the concept of peninsulas and islands can improve existing measurement systems. In one example, they show that RIPE's DNSmon suffers misconfiguration and persistent network problems that are important, but risk obscuring operationally important connectivity changes because they are $5\times$ to $9.7\times$ larger. Our evaluation also informs policy questions, showing no single country or organization can unilaterally control the Internet core.</description>

      <title>Integrated Push-and-Pull Update Model for Goal-Oriented Effective Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decision-making for goal-oriented effective communication. We consider an end-to-end status update system where a sensing agent (SA) observes a source, generates and transmits updates to an actuation agent (AA), while the AA takes actions to accomplish a goal at the endpoint. We integrate the push- and pull-based update communication models to obtain a push-and-pull model, which allows the transmission controller at the SA to decide to push an update to the AA and the query controller at the AA to pull updates by raising queries at specific time instances. To gauge effectiveness, we utilize a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric incorporating updates' freshness, usefulness, and timeliness of actions as qualitative attributes. We then derive effect-aware policies to maximize the expected discounted sum of updates' effectiveness subject to induced costs. The effect-aware policy at the SA considers the potential effectiveness of communicated updates at the endpoint, while at the AA, it accounts for the probabilistic evolution of the source and importance of generated updates. Our results show the proposed push-and-pull model outperforms models solely based on push- or pull-based updates both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, using effect-aware policies at both agents enhances effectiveness compared to periodic and/or probabilistic effect-agnostic policies at either or both agents.</description>

      <title>Routing in Quantum Networks with End-to-End Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties, which we call the 'grey box approach'. In this study, we define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the grey box algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Frame Preemption on Combined TSN Shapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different scheduling mechanisms in Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) can be integrated together to design and support complex architectures with enhanced capabilities for mixed critical networks. Integrating Frame Preemption (FP) with Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) and Gate Control List (GCL) opens up different modes and configuration choices resulting in a complex evaluation of several possibilities and their impact on the Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we implement and quantify the integration of preemptive CBS with GCL by incorporating FP into the architecture. Our experiments show that the end-to-end delay of Audio Video Bridging (AVB) flows shaped by CBS reduces significantly (up to 40\%) when AVB flows are set to preemptable class. We further show that the jitter of Time Triggered (TT) traffic remains unaffected in "with Hold/Release" mode. Furthermore, we propose to introduce Guardband (GB) in the "without Hold/Release" to reduce the jitter of the TT flow. We compare all the different integration modes, starting with CBS with GCL, extending it further to FP. We evaluate all feasible combinations in both synthetic and realistic scenarios and offer recommendations for practical configuration methods.</description>

      <title>Agent-driven Generative Semantic Communication with Cross-Modality and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of 6G, with compelling visions of intelligent transportation systems and digital twins, remote surveillance is poised to become a ubiquitous practice. Substantial data volume and frequent updates present challenges in wireless networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel agent-driven generative semantic communication (A-GSC) framework based on reinforcement learning. In contrast to the existing research on semantic communication (SemCom), which mainly focuses on either semantic extraction or semantic sampling, we seamlessly integrate both by jointly considering the intrinsic attributes of source information and the contextual information regarding the task. Notably, the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) enables the independent design of semantic encoders and decoders. In this work, we develop an agent-assisted semantic encoder with cross-modality capability, which can track the semantic changes, channel condition, to perform adaptive semantic extraction and sampling. Accordingly, we design a semantic decoder with both predictive and generative capabilities, consisting of two tailored modules. Moreover, the effectiveness of the designed models has been verified using the UA-DETRAC dataset, demonstrating the performance gains of the overall A-GSC framework in both energy saving and reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Data Service Maximization in Space-Air-Ground Integrated 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks has emerged as a promising paradigm to fulfill the constantly growing demand for connectivity, low transmission delay, and quality of services (QoS). This integration brings together the strengths of the reliability of terrestrial networks, broad coverage and service continuity of non-terrestrial networks like low earth orbit satellites (LEOSats), etc. In this work, we study a data service maximization problem in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) where the ground base stations (GBSs) and LEOSats cooperatively serve the coexisting aerial users (AUs) and ground users (GUs). Then, by considering the spectrum scarcity, interference, and QoS requirements of the users, we jointly optimize the user association, AU's trajectory, and power allocation. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we disintegrate it into two subproblems: 1) user association problem and 2) trajectory and power allocation problem. We formulate the user association problem as a binary integer programming problem and solve it by using the Gurobi optimizer. Meanwhile, the trajectory and power allocation problem is solved by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to cope with the problem's non-convexity and dynamic network environments. Then, the two subproblems are alternately solved by the proposed block coordinate descent algorithm. By comparing with the baselines in the existing literature, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Swapping in Orbit: a Satellite Quantum Link Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite quantum communication is a promising way to build long distance quantum links, making it an essential complement to optical fiber for quantum internetworking beyond metropolitan scales. A satellite point to point optical link differs from the more common fiber links in many ways, both quantitative (higher latency, strong losses) and qualitative (nonconstant parameter values during satellite passage, intermittency of the link, impossibility to set repeaters between the satellite and the ground station). We study here the performance of a quantum link between two ground stations, using a quantum-memory-equipped satellite as a quantum repeater. In contrast with quantum key distribution satellite links, the number of available quantum memory slots m, together with the unavoidable round-trip communication latency t of at least a few milliseconds, severely reduces the effective average repetition rate to m/t -- at most a few kilohertz for foreseeable quantum memories. Our study uses two approaches, which validate each other: 1) a simple analytical model of the effective rate of the quantum link; 2) an event-based simulation using the open source Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). The important differences between satellite and fiber links led us to modify QuISP itself. This work paves the way to the study of hybrid satellite- and fiber-based quantum repeater networks interconnecting different metropolitan areas.</description>
