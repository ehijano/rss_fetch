      <title>Generalization of Ceva theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel generalization of the classical Ceva theorem to arbitrarily dimensional simplexes. Our approach allows cevians to have any dimension (smaller than the dimension of the base simplex). Consequently, our result unifies other generalizations of the Ceva theorem obtained in recent years.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Busemann Spaces with Non-Negative Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the structure theory of Burago--Gromov--Perelman for Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below, to the setting of Busemann spaces with non-negative curvature. We prove that any finite-dimensional Busemann space with non-negative curvature satisfying Ohta's $S$-concavity and local semi-convexity, admits a non-trivial integer-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and satisfies the measure contraction property. We also show that such spaces are rectifiable and that almost every point admits a unique tangent cone isometric to a finite-dimensional Banach space. In addition, under mild control of the uniform smoothness constant, we obtain refined estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular strata. Our results not only enrich the theory of synthetic sectional curvature lower bound for metric spaces, but also provide some useful tools and examples to study Finslerian metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Complementary bodies in sphere packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic and graphical tools, such as Mathematica, enable precise visualization and analysis of void spaces in sphere packings. In the cubic close packing (CCP, or face-centred cubic packing; FCC) arrangement these voids can be partitioned into repeating geometric units we term spherically truncated polyhedra - bodies analogous to plane-truncated polyhedra but bounded by both planar and spherical surfaces. These structures are relevant in geometric studies and applications such as modelling diffusion in porous media and biological tissues. This work examines the properties of these complementary bodies, deriving their surface area-to-volume ratios, which are significant in physical contexts; and we establish a result concerning the packing density of truncated tetrahedra and octahedra, demonstrating how they tile the interstitial space surrounding packed spheres. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of classical packing problems and their geometrical complements.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian Minkowski problem for epigraphs of convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variational formula is derived by combining the Gaussian volume of the epigraph of a convex function $\varphi$ and the perturbation of $\varphi$ via the infimal convolution. This formula naturally leads to a Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a Borel measure on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. The resulting Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will be called the Euclidean Gaussian moment measure of the convex function $\varphi$, and the related Minkowski-type problem will be studied. In particular, the newly posed Minkowski problem is solved under some mild and natural conditions on the pre-given measure.</description>

      <title>On characteristic properties of the ellipsoid in terms of circumscribed cones of a convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We strongly believe that in order to prove two important geometrical pro\-blems in convexity, namely, the G. Bianchi and P. Gruber's Conjecture \cite{bigru} and the J. A. Barker and D. G. Larman's Conjecture \cite{Barker}, it is necessary obtain new characteristic properties of the ellipsoid, which involves the notions defined in such problems. In this work we present a series of results which intent to be a progress in such direction: Let $L,K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be convex bodies, $n\geq 3$, and $L$ be a subset in the interior of $K$. Then each of the following conditions i), ii) and iii) implies that $L$ is an ellipsoid.
  i) $L$ is $O$-symmetric and, for every $x$ in the boundary of $K$, the support cone $S(L,x)$ is ellipsoidal.
  ii) there exists a point $p\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that for every $x$ in the boundary of $K$, there exists a point $y$ in the boundary of $K$ and hyperplane $\Pi$, passing through $p$, such that \[ S(L,x)\cap S(L,y)=\Pi \cap \textrm{bd } K. \]
  iii) $K$ and $L$ are $O$-symmetric, every $x$ in the boundary of $K$ is a pole of $L$ and $\Omega_x:=S(L,x)\cap S(L,-x)$ is contained in the interior of $K$.
  In the case ii), $K$ is also an ellipsoid and it is concentric with $L$. On the other hand, let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a $O$-symmetric convex body, $n\geq 3$, and let $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ be a ball with centre at $O$. We are going to prove that if $B$ is small enough and all the sections of $K$ given by planes tangent to $B$ are $(n-1)$-ellipsoids, then $K$ is an $n$-ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>1-Uryson width and covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following question: Do there exist Riemannian polyhedra $X$ such that the 1-Uryson width of their universal covers $\mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X})$ is bounded but $\mathrm{UW}_1(X)$ is arbitrarily large? We rule out two specific cases: when $\pi_1(X)$ is virtually cyclic and when $X$ is a Riemannian surface. More specifically, we show that if $X$ is a compact polyhedron with a virtually cyclic fundamental group, then its 1-Uryson width is bounded by the 1-Uryson width of its universal cover $\widetilde{X}$. Precisely: $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq 6 \cdot \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ We show that if $X$ is a Riemannian surface with boundary then $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ Furthermore, we show that if there exist spaces $X$ for which $\mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X})$ is bounded while $\mathrm{UW}_1(X)$ is arbitrarily large, then such examples must already appear in low dimensions. In particular, such $X$ can be found among Riemannian $2$-complexes.</description>

Abstract: A paper torus is an embedded polyhedral torus that is isometric to a flat torus in the intrinsic sense.
  We prove that there does not exist a paper torus with $7$ vertices,
  and that there does exist a paper torus with $8$ vertices.
  This settles the question of the minimum number of
  vertices needed for a paper torus.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

Abstract: We determine the smallest size of a non-antipodal spherical design with harmonic indices $\{1,3,\dots,2m-1\}$ to be $2m+1$, where $m$ is a positive integer. This is achieved by proving an analogous result for interval designs.</description>

      <title>Martingale and analytic dimensions coincide under Gaussian heat kernel bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet form on a metric measure space that satisfies Gaussian heat kernel bounds, we show that the martingale dimension of the associated diffusion process coincides with Cheeger's analytic dimension of the underlying metric measure space. More precisely, we show that the pointwise version of the martingale dimension introduced by Hino (called the pointwise index) almost everywhere equals the pointwise dimension of the measurable differentiable structure constructed by Cheeger. Using known properties of spaces that admit a measurable differentiable structure, we show that the martingale dimension is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying metric space, thereby extending an earlier bound obtained by Hino for some self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>
