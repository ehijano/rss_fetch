      <title>Revisiting the Excess Volatility Puzzle Through the Lens of the Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We amend and extend the Chiarella model of financial markets to deal with arbitrary long-term value drifts in a consistent way. This allows us to improve upon existing calibration schemes, opening the possibility of calibrating individual monthly time series instead of classes of time series. The technique is employed on spot prices of four asset classes from ca. 1800 onward (stock indices, bonds, commodities, currencies). The so-called fundamental value is a direct output of the calibration, which allows us to (a) quantify the amount of excess volatility in these markets, which we find to be large (e.g. a factor $\approx$ 4 for stock indices) and consistent with previous estimates; and (b) determine the distribution of mispricings (i.e. the difference between market price and value), which we find in many cases to be bimodal. Both findings are strongly at odds with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also study in detail the 'sloppiness' of the calibration, that is, the directions in parameter space that are weakly constrained by data. The main conclusions of our study are remarkably consistent across different asset classes, and reinforce the hypothesis that the medium-term fate of financial markets is determined by a tug-of-war between trend followers and fundamentalists.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distributions of the Mode-switching Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the stationary distribution in various regimes of the extended Chiarella model of financial markets. This model is a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system that encompasses dynamical competition between a (saturating) trending and a mean-reverting component. We find the so-called mispricing distribution and the trend distribution to be unimodal Gaussians in the small noise, small feedback limit. Slow trends yield Gaussian-cosh mispricing distributions that allow for a P-bifurcation: unimodality occurs when mean-reversion is fast, bimodality when it is slow. The critical point of this bifurcation is established and refutes previous ad-hoc reports and differs from the bifurcation condition of the dynamical system itself. For fast, weakly coupled trends, deploying the Furutsu-Novikov theorem reveals that the result is again unimodal Gaussian. For the same case with higher coupling we disprove another claim from the literature: bimodal trend distributions do not generally imply bimodal mispricing distributions. The latter becomes bimodal only for stronger trend feedback. The exact solution in this last regime remains unfortunately beyond our proficiency.</description>
