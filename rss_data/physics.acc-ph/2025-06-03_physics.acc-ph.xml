      <title>ILC250 Cost Update -- 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider was conceived as a global project for an energy-frontier electron-positron collider.It employs superconducting RF and nano-beam technologies with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. Its cost was estimated in 2013, based on the Technical Design Report published in 2013.Japan's high-energy community proposed to host the ILC in Japan as a Higgs boson factory at 250 GeV in its first phase, and a revised cost estimate was conducted in 2017 to host it in Japan. However, due to global price increases and currency fluctuations that emerged afterward, the 2017 estimate is now outdated. A new cost evaluation has therefore been performed, according for global inflation tends, exchange rate shifts, and recent experiences in SRF based accelerators. This report describes the cost update performed in 2024. The cost update is included in the ILC Status Report in May 2025, contributing to the ongoing 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Automatic Differentiation Using Symbolic Differential Algebra: Bridging the Gap between Algorithmic and Symbolic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scientific computation, it is often necessary to calculate higher-order derivatives of a function. Currently, two primary methods for higher-order automatic differentiation exist: symbolic differentiation and algorithmic automatic differentiation (AD). Differential Algebra (DA) is a mathematical technique widely used in beam dynamics analysis and simulations of particle accelerators, and it also functions as an algorithmic automatic differentiation method. DA automatically computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a specific point up to a predetermined order and the derivatives can be easily extracted from the coefficients of the expansion. We have developed a Symbolic Differential Algebra (SDA) package that integrates algorithmic differentiation with symbolic computation to produce explicit expressions for higher-order derivatives using the computational techniques of algorithmic differentiation. Our code has been validated against existing DA and AD libraries. Moreover, we demonstrate that SDA not only facilitates the simplification of explicit expressions but also significantly accelerates the calculation of higher-order derivatives, compared to directly using AD.</description>

      <title>Two-colour balanced optical cross-correlator using fibre-coupled PPLN waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-colour fully fibre-coupled balanced optical cross-correlator (BOXC) based on sum-frequency generation (SFG) between 1560 nm and 800 nm laser pulses using waveguides implemented in type-0 phase-matched periodically poled LiNbO$_{3}$ (PPLN) crystals. The interaction has an effective nonlinear coefficient of $d_{eff}$ = 16.1 pm/V, many times higher than comparable nonlinear crystals used for this SFG interaction such as barium borate (BBO). The resulting sensitivity of the cross-correlator is measured to be 5.11 mV/fs, five times greater than current bulk-optic BOXCs after accounting for differences in transimpedance gain and photodetector responsivity, with the potential for significantly higher sensitivity after optimisations to the cross-correlator design.</description>

      <title>Ion-motion simulations of a plasma-wakefield experiment at FLASHForward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In plasma-based acceleration, an ultra-relativistic particle bunch$\unicode{x2014}$or an intense laser beam$\unicode{x2014}$is used to expel electrons from its propagation path, forming a wake that is devoid of electrons. The ions, being significantly more massive, are often assumed to be stationary. However, both theory and simulations suggest that any sufficiently dense electron bunch can trigger ion motion, and its effect must be taken into account. We simulate beam-driven plasma wakefields to identify key features$\unicode{x2014}$such as longitudinally dependent emittance growth$\unicode{x2014}$that could be observed in an experiment using plasma and beam parameters from the FLASHForward facility at DESY.</description>
