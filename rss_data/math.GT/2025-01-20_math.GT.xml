      <title>Holonomy, Zeta Functions, and Cohomological Structures in Foliated Manifolds with Stratified Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interplay between holonomy, Ihara zeta functions, and cohomological structures within the framework of ratified F-completions of foliated manifolds. We develop a novel formalism for the Gamma-set, a topological multigraph that captures intersection points of foliations with stratified boundaries, and use it to define an Ihara zeta function that encodes the manifold's symmetries. By investigating the holonomy group of spinor fields in relation to the Delta-actions on the Gamma-set, we conjecture a duality between holonomy fixed points and the poles of the Ihara zeta function, extending to twisted cohomology classes. We further analyze how the twist map T impacts cohomology within stratified spaces, highlighting the role of vector bundles and the twisted cochain complex. Applications of our framework to spectral graph theory and tiling in R^n demonstrate the power of holonomy-zeta duality in geometrically rich foliated structures.</description>

      <title>Minimum numbers of Dehn colors of knots and $\mathcal{R}$-palette graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider minimum numbers of colors of knots for Dehn colorings. In particular, we will show that for any odd prime number $p$ and any Dehn $p$-colorable knot $K$, the minimum number of colors for $K$ is at least $\lfloor \log_2 p \rfloor +2$. Moreover, we will define the $\R$-palette graph for a set of colors. The $\R$-palette graphs are quite useful to give candidates of sets of colors which might realize a nontrivially Dehn $p$-colored diagram. In Appendix, we also prove that for Dehn $5$-colorable knot, the minimum number of colors is $4$.</description>

      <title>Minimum numbers of Dehn colors of knots and symmetric local biquandle cocycle invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a method to evaluate minimum numbers of Dehn colors for knots by using symmetric local biquandle cocycle invariants. We give answers to some questions arising as a consequence of our previous paper [6]. In particular, we show that there exist knots which are distinguished by minimum numbers of Dehn colors.</description>

      <title>A proof of Dunfield-Gukov-Rasmussen Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2005 Dunfield, Gukov and Rasmussen conjectured an existence of the spectral sequence from the reduced triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of a knot to its knot Floer homology defined by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o. The main result of this paper is a proof of this conjecture. For this purpose, we construct a bigraded spectral sequence from the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology constructed by the last two authors to the knot Floer homology. Using the fact that the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology comes equipped with a spectral sequence from the reduced triply graded homology, we obtain our main result. The first spectral sequence is of Bockstein type and comes from a subtle manipulation of coefficients. The main tools are quantum traces of foams and of singular Soergel bimodules and a $\mathbb Z$-valued cube of resolutions model for knot Floer homology originally constructed by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o over the field of two elements. As an application, we deduce that the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology as well as the reduced triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky one detect the unknot, the two trefoils, the figure eight knot and the cinquefoil.</description>

      <title>Squared Distance Function on the Configuration Space of a planar Spider with Applications to Hooke Energy and Voronoi Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spider mechanisms are the simplest examples of arachnoid mechanisms, they are one step more complicated than polygonal linkages. Their configuration spaces have been studied intensively, but are yet not completely understood. In the paper we study them using the Morse theory of the squared distance function from the "body" of the spider to some fixed point in the plane. Generically, it is a Morse-Bott function. We list its critical manifolds, describe them as products of polygon spaces, and derive a formula for their Morse-Bott indices. We apply the obtained results to Hooke energy and Voronoi distance.</description>
