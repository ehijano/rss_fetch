      <title>Tube Integrability in a Time-Dependent Nonlinear Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear oscillator z'' + omega^2 z + g(t) z^2 = 0 with a time-dependent coefficient g(t). We show that this equation admits an exact quadratic invariant I(z,p,t) provided that g(t) = alpha2(t)^(-5/2) and that alpha2(t) satisfies a nonlinear third-order differential equation. The resulting invariant constrains the dynamics to a smooth two-dimensional surface in the extended phase space (z,p,t). If alpha2(t) is periodic, this surface forms a compact invariant torus. However, we show that periodic solutions of alpha2(t) are generically obstructed by a resonance mechanism, leading instead to an aperiodic but non-chaotic evolution. In this regime the invariant surface is non-compact and extends along the time direction, forming a tube rather than a torus. We therefore propose the term "tube integrability" for integrable systems whose invariant manifolds are non-compact in time. A perturbation expansion for alpha2(t) up to third order is derived and compared with numerical integration, clarifying the parameter regimes in which the truncated series provides quantitatively accurate approximations. The breakdown of the series for small y0 reflects the asymptotic nature of the expansion rather than a loss of integrability.</description>

      <title>Perturbative nonlinear J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formulation for a nonlinear extension of the J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions. That is, we obtain the scattering matrix for the time-independent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry. The formulation relies on the linearization of products of orthogonal polynomials and on the utilization of the tools of the J-matrix method. Gauss quadrature integral approximation is instrumental in the numerical implementation of the approach. We present the theory for a general \psi ^{2n + 1} nonlinearity, where n is a natural number, and obtain results for the cubic and quintic nonlinearities, \psi ^3 and \psi ^5. At certain value(s) of the energy, we observe the occurrence of bifurcation with two stable solutions. This curious and interesting phenomenon is a clear signature and manifestation of the underlying nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess exact structures that resemble integrability, with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such structures live in the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and are based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes, have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite-dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle S^1 to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD, they are color singlets and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>
