      <title>Pre-training vision models for the classification of alerts from wide-field time-domain surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wide-field time-domain surveys facilitate the study of transient, variable and moving phenomena by conducting image differencing and relaying alerts to their communities. Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.</description>

      <title>The automation of optical transient discovery and classification in Rubin-era time-domain astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, capture dozens of transients each night. The workflows for discovering and classifying transients in survey data streams have become increasingly automated over decades of development. The recent integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools has produced major milestones, including the fully automated end-to-end discovery and classification of an optical transient, and has enabled automated rapid-response space-based follow-up. The now-operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time are accelerating the rate of transient discovery and producing large volumes of data at incredible rates. Given the expected order-of-magnitude increase in transient discoveries, one promising path forwards for optical time-domain astronomy is heavily investing in accelerating the automation of our workflows. Here we review the current paradigm of real-time transient workflows, project their evolution during the Rubin era and present recommendations for accelerating transient astronomy with automation.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS On-the-Fly continuum survey: pipeline design and validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) is designed to map large areas of the Southern sky for cosmology using the single-dish HI intensity mapping (IM) technique, while simultaneously delivering a wide, high angular-resolution interferometric survey. We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis.
  We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.
  The full survey will cover $10,000 \, {\rm deg}^{2}$ at 544-1088 MHz, and after the delay tracking fix implemented we expect to reach $\sim 25 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ at $14$ arcsec resolution. The continuum OTF data products will support diverse science goals, including galaxy and AGN evolution, diffuse cluster emission, large-scale structure and cosmology, rotation-measure synthesis, and transient searches. MeerKLASS-OTF thus establishes an efficient path to wide-area commensal surveys with MeerKAT and provides a key technical precursor for SKA-Mid.</description>

      <title>Semantic search for 100M+ galaxy images using AI-generated captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding scientifically interesting phenomena through slow, manual labeling campaigns severely limits our ability to explore the billions of galaxy images produced by telescopes. In this work, we develop a pipeline to create a semantic search engine from completely unlabeled image data. Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results. For the first time, AION-Search enables flexible semantic search scalable to 140 million galaxy images, enabling discovery from previously infeasible searches. More broadly, our work provides an approach for making large, unlabeled scientific image archives semantically searchable, expanding data exploration capabilities in fields from Earth observation to microscopy. The code, data, and app are publicly available at https://github.com/NolanKoblischke/AION-Search</description>

      <title>Revisiting x-CTE in WFC3/UVIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most discussion of charge-transfer-efficiency (CTE) losses involves the parallel transfer of charge in the y-direction down the chip columns (y-CTE). Serial charge-transfer efficiency (x-CTE) refers to the horizontal transer of charge. Serial CTE losses were first assessed in WFC3/UVIS in 2014 (WFC3/ISR 2014-02), where it was found that bright stars were shifted by roughly 0.0015 pixel away from the readout amplifier. Now that the WFC3/UVIS CCD has spent more than three times as long in space, imperfect serial CTE should have three times the impact on the images, so we revisit the effect and characterize serial CTE in a similar manner to our models for parallel-CTE by using a combination of warm pixels, cosmic rays, saturated stars, and overscan pixels. Overall, serial CTE has a much smaller impact on images than does parallel CTE. As of 2023, parallel CTE can have a roughly 5 percent impact on bright sources and a greater than 50 percent impact on faint sources, and serial CTE can have a roughly 1% impact on bright sources and a roughly 3 percent impact on fainter sources. The first few pixels in the serial CTE trails are much sharper than the parallel trails, but there is a very faint component to the serial trails that extends much farther than the parallel trails, even wrapping around to the next row. We develop a pixel-based model for the trapping and release of charge in the serial register and release a stand-alone beta-version of this pixel-based serial-CTE correction. Most images are not significantly impacted by the x-CTE effect, however HST users that require high-precision astrometry could benefit from this correction. At the very least, curious users can quantify its potential impact on their science.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic characterisation of millihertz gravitational-wave sources in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>Bibliometric benchmarking across astronomy journals: Knowledge-use cycle and PASJ in the global landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative bibliometric analysis of eight astronomy journals over 1996--2024, including \textit{Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan} (PASJ). Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we extract annual indicators of publication activity and scholarly impact, analyze time series, citation distributions, and citation age profiles, and benchmark PASJ within this landscape. The age profiles reveal a characteristic knowledge-use cycle: citations rise over $\sim$2--4 years, approach saturation by $\sim$10--12 years, underscoring limits of short-window impact metrics. Journals published by European and North American astronomical organizations sustain higher impact, whereas PASJ generally lies below the world baseline. In parallel, PASJ shows episodic above-baseline impact through facility- or mission-driven special issues and features that, given the journal's modest annual volume, can materially shift year-level metrics. These patterns point to two potential avenues for PASJ: well-timed, thoughtfully organized special issues and features that highlight high-impact results, and continued strengthening of international collaboration.</description>

      <title>The Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian imaging of astrophysical measurement data shares universal properties across the electromagnetic spectrum: it requires probabilistic descriptions of possible images and spectra, and instrument responses. To unify Bayesian imaging, we present the Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit (UBIK). Currently, UBIK images data from Chandra, eROSITA, JWST, and ALMA. UBIK is based on information field theory (IFT), the mathematical theory of field inference, and on NIFTy, a package for numerical IFT. UBIK provides sky models that are instrument independent and instrument interfaces that share common parts of their response representations. It is open source, can provide spatio-spectral image cubes, jointly analyses data from several instruments, and separates diffuse emission, point sources, and extended emission regions.</description>

      <title>SIMLA: The Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph Mapping Legacy Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Spitzer/IRS Mapping Legacy Archive (SIMLA); a complete set of mid-infrared spectral cubes built from low-resolution mapping-mode fixed-target observations from Spitzer/IRS (5.2-38{\mu}m, R~60-130). Contained in this dataset are spectral maps for several hundred spatially-resolved and unresolved objects, including galaxies, molecular clouds, supernova remnants, HII regions, and more. Each cube has been carefully treated to remove astronomical foregrounds and backgrounds as well as detector effects using a novel pipeline we describe here. Cube assembly was facilitated by the CUBISM code, which included automatic detection and removal of bad pixels. We describe the SIMLA pipeline for reducing and validating the cubes. SIMLA will soon be available at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive.</description>

      <title>Toward the time-domain spectroscopic study of the dynamic life of stars: from accretion to magnetic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and planets can be seen as the second fundamental building blocks of baryons in the universe (only second to the dust and gas in molecular clouds). Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Transients as Determinants of Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity, manifested through spots (faculae and flares), fundamentally shapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside, the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at R$\sim$4,000 and $\sim$40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Nyx-RT: Adaptive Ray Tracing in the Nyx Hydrodynamical Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid. For these full cosmological simulations, we demonstrate convergence in terms of reionization history and post-ionization Lyman-alpha forest flux.</description>

      <title>Mega-MUSE Nearby Galaxy Serendipity Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mega-MUSE Nearby Galaxy Serendipity Survey is a White Paper in response to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for Ideas. It is based on the notion that novel observing facilities for astronomy almost always make discoveries that were not anticipated at the time of planning and conceptual design. Unlike other surveys it is not targeting the solution of a single specific astrophysical problem, but enables the exploitation of data obtained from other surveys in Local Group and Local Volume galaxies to clarify open science questions that cannot be solved otherwise. The most prominent objectives are to obtain solid statistics of rare stars and gaseous nebulae as well as their properties that are not accessible in the Milky Way disk due to extinction and selection effects, and the discovery of as yet unknown phenomena.</description>

      <title>AttenGW: A Lightweight Attention-Based Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Detection Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AttenGW, an attention-based multi-detector gravitational-wave detection model and accompanying software stack designed for analysis of real LIGO data. AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of the Upgraded Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope Camera Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a ground-based observatory that will improve upon the sensitivities of the current generation of very-high-energy gamma-ray instruments. The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a dual-mirror candidate design for a CTAO Medium-Sized Telescope (MST). The prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) was inaugurated in 2019 at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona and observed significant gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a partially populated camera. The pSCT camera is currently being upgraded to fully instrument the focal plane with 11,328 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels split between 177 camera modules. Additionally, the modules will feature upgraded electronics designed to reduce electronics crosstalk and noise. A module calibration procedure has been developed using a preproduction test module. Following this calibration procedure, performance testing shows that the upgrade module has low noise, minimal electronics crosstalk, and excellent charge resolution. After calibration and optimization, the 177 production modules will be installed in the pSCT camera for commissioning. This will be followed by observations of known VHE gamma-ray sources for camera performance validation.</description>

      <title>CUBE2: A Parallel $N$-Body Simulation Code for Scalability, Accuracy, and Memory Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $N$-body simulation serves as a critical method for modeling cosmic evolution and represents a significant challenge in high-performance computing. We present CUBE2, a cosmological $N$-body code emphasizing memory efficiency, computational performance, scalability and precision. The core of its algorithm utilizes Particle-Mesh (PM) method to solve the Poisson equation for matter distribution, leveraging the well-optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for computational efficiency. In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts. Using CUBE2, we run two cosmological simulations with particle counts of $6144^3$ on the Advanced Computing East China Sub-center (ACECS) to test performance and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multiband neural network classification of ZTF light curves as LSST proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13395v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, {\delta} Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%. At the test classification phase three variable star types out of the 5 classes were classified with around 99% of accuracy, the other two also had very high accuracy, 89.6% and 93.6%.</description>

      <title>diffhydro: Inverse Multiphysics Modeling and Embedded Machine Learning in Astrophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the extension of the differentiable hydrodynamics code, diffhydro, enabling scalable PDE-constrained inference and integrated hybrid physics-ML models for a wide range of astrophysical applications. New physics additions include radiative heating/cooling, OU-driven turbulence, and self-gravity via multigrid Poisson. We demonstrate good agreement with the Athena++ code on standard validation tests such as Sedov-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and driven/decaying turbulence. We further introduce a solver-in-the-loop neural corrector that reduces coarse-grid errors during time integration while preserving stability. The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations.</description>

      <title>Towards measuring astrophysical third order correlation functions with the H.E.S.S. optical intensity interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closure phase, the sum of the three Fourier phases in a telescope triangle, is an important tool in astronomical interferometry, helping to reconstruct the geometries of the observed objects. While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\cos \phi$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($\sigma $ Sgr) and Dschubba ($\delta$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\cos \phi$. For the observed stellar targets the sensitivity is not high enough to extract closure phase information. To demonstrate that the analysis works well we further extract $\cos \phi$ in a laboratory experiment, using the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer and a pseudo-thermal light source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this white paper we focus on compact stellar systems, star clusters, nuclear star clusters (NSCs), stripped nuclei, and ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs), as engines of galaxy evolution and black-hole growth. We show how the same capability also enables transformative science in active galactic nucleus (AGN) fuelling, stellar surfaces and interacting binaries, and exoplanet atmospheres. These science drivers are naturally aligned with a next-generation kilometre-scale optical/IR interferometer for the 2040s that reuses existing ESO infrastructure while adding diffraction-limited integral-field spectroscopy (IFS).</description>

      <title>Tracing the Early Milky Way with Globular Clusters: The Diagnostic Power of Neutron-Capture Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental tracers of the early assembly of the Milky Way (MW). They formed in diverse environments -- including both our Galaxy and dwarf galaxies -- retaining chemical and dynamical signatures that encode their origins and the merger history of the Galaxy. Although significant progress has been made in characterising GC chemistry, most studies have focused on light, $\alpha$-, and iron-peak elements. In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo. Addressing this gap requires high-resolution, multiplexing, and blue-sensitive spectroscopy capable of accessing the full suite of n-capture diagnostics in several tens of stars per GC.</description>

      <title>XID+PRIMA, II: Stepping Through Hyperspectral Imaging to Deblend PRIMAger Beyond the Extragalactic Confusion Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (&gt;98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS UHF On-the-Fly Continuum Survey -- Data Release I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first public data release (DR1) from the interferometric component of the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) UHF survey, a legacy program demonstrating a novel on-the-fly (OTF) mapping technique. This release is based on 12 hours of early science observations covering approximately 800 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe the data processing pipeline developed to calibrate and image these fast-scanning observations, producing high-fidelity continuum images at a central frequency of 816 MHz. The resulting mosaic reaches an RMS sensitivity of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in its deepest regions, with a typical angular resolution of $\sim32'' \times 17''$. In these images, we identify $95483$ radio sources. We validate the catalogue through cross-matching with external surveys, confirming sub-arcsecond astrometric accuracy and a robust flux density scale. We compute the differential source counts, finding excellent agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. The success of this pilot study serves as a crucial proof of concept for the OTF observing strategy, and the public release of the images and source catalogue provides a valuable resource for a wide range of astrophysical studies. This work paves the way for the full MeerKLASS OTF survey and future large-area survey projects with the SKA.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Probes of the Supermassive Black Hole Binary Population: The Role of Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By inferring the gravitational wave background (GWB) from a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) enable the study of massive black holes. In many ways, PTAs manifest the promise of a multimessenger approach to astronomy: they can constrain SMBHB population characteristics that are otherwise difficult to constrain using electromagnetic observations, such as hardening mechanisms at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\%. Additionally, there is an 88\% chance that PTA data can reduce the prior uncertainty in the characteristic mass variable of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by 25--50\%. For $M_{\text{BH}}$--$M_{\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations. Our work delineates the domains over which electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data constrain the demographics and dynamics of the supermassive black-hole binary population, offering a clearer picture of the impact of population multi-messenger astrophysics probes with PTAs.</description>

      <title>Pivot-Only Azimuthal Control and Attitude Estimation of Balloon-borne Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Characterizing Very Low Mass Spectral Blend Binaries with Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to identifying and characterizing unresolved, very low mass spectral blend binaries composed of late-M, L, and T dwarfs using machine learning methodologies. We generated and evaluated a series of hierarchical random forest models to distinguish spectral blends from single very low-mass dwarfs, and to classify their primary and secondary components. Models were trained on a sample of single and synthesized binary templates generated from empirical spectra. We explored various aspects of the design of our models, and find that models trained on a full range of single and binary combinations have the best performance for identification and component classification. These models achieve binary identification recall and precision of $\gtrsim$85%, median component classification errors of $\lesssim$0.1 subtypes, and systematic classification uncertainties of $\lesssim$1 subtype, outperforming index-based methods in terms of fidelity, range, and speed. Optimal performance is achieved for binaries composed of L and T dwarf primaries and late-L and T dwarf secondaries. When applied to the spectra of previously confirmed very low-mass binaries, model performance is degraded due to the prevalence of systems with similar component types, but remains high in the optimal performance range. We propose potential improvements to these models, which can be used to explore binary populations among the thousands to millions of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs anticipated with large-scale spectral surveys such as SPHEREx and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter with magnetic resonance force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) search for axion dark matter around 1 GHz. The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Sulfur Chemistry Network with Excited S(1D) and SO(1{\Delta}) for XODIAC Photochemical Model: Validation on Venus and Implications for Exo-Venus Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur chemistry is fundamental to understanding the structure, cloud formation, and atmospheric composition of Venus and Venus-like exoplanets. However, many key reactions involving ground- and excited-state sulfur species remain poorly characterized, and current photochemical models rely on networks that lack accurate kinetic data under high-temperature, high-CO2 conditions. We compute kinetic parameters for reactions of ground-state S(3P) and excited-state S(1D) with CO2 under Venus-like conditions. These reactions form SO(3Sigma), SO(1Delta), and CO. The potential energy surfaces reveal intermediates, and temperature-dependent rate coefficients are obtained using a master-equation approach based on the chemically significant eigenvalue method. NASA 7-term polynomial coefficients are also derived for ground- and excited-state S and SO for consistent use in photochemical models. Incorporating these data into the one-dimensional photochemical model XODIAC shows that these reactions exert only a minor influence above 60 km in the Venus atmosphere due to competing pathways. The model agrees with observations for most sulfur-bearing species except S3 and S4. Introducing a 1 ppm near-surface atomic sulfur mixing ratio, representing a possible deep-atmosphere or surface source or accounting for missing sulfur processes, increases S3 and S4 by 1-2 orders of magnitude and improves agreement with measurements. For exo-Venus analogs with stratospheric isotherms and strong stellar irradiation, the new reactions significantly modify the vertical profiles of major sulfur species above 30 km and enhance S(1D) and SO(1Delta) more strongly than in scenarios with only isotherms or only irradiation. These results underscore the importance of accurate excited-state sulfur kinetics and the need for updated reaction networks when modeling Venus and exo-Venus atmospheres.</description>

      <title>On the use of polarized thermal emission to constrain cloud grain size and temperature structure of sub-stellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for probing the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets, but interpretations based on flux spectra alone often suffer from degeneracies among temperature structure, chemical composition, and cloud properties. Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra.</description>

      <title>Hybrid algorithm combining matched filtering and convolutional neural networks for searching gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence are crucial for gravitational wave observations. We present a proof-of-concept for a method that utilizes a neural network taking an SNR map, a stack of SNR time series calculated by the matched filter, as input and predicting the presence or absence of gravitational waves in observational data. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to a dataset of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass black hole mergers injected into stationary Gaussian noise. Our algorithm exhibits comparable performance to the standard matched-filter pipeline and to the machine-learning algorithms that participated in the mock data challenge, MLGWSC-1. The demonstration also shows that our algorithm achieves reasonable sensitivity with practical computational resources.</description>

      <title>Exploiting light coherence in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect, discovered in the 1950s and further developed in the 1960s, was originally used to estimate stellar angular diameters through intensity correlations measured by spatially separated detectors. Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics.
  When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary "messenger", carrying internal information about the astronomical source.</description>

      <title>HEL1OS -- A Hard X-ray Spectrometer on Board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer) is one of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission designed to continuously monitor and measure the time-resolved spectra of solar flares between 8 keV and 150 keV. This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\circ$ $\times$ 6$^\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.</description>

      <title>Flashing fast: characterising the 2025 outburst of MAXI J1957+032</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MAXI J1957+032 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that shows brief, recurrent outbursts in an ultra-compact ~1 h orbit. We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \pm 2) kpc and {\xi}=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.</description>

      <title>VLBI astrometry of radio stars to link radio and optical celestial reference frames III: 11 radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G&lt;13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of &lt;1% in the best cases. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.</description>

      <title>Citizen CATE 2024: Extending Totality During the 8 April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse with a Distributed Network of Community Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants ("citizen scientists") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.</description>

      <title>astroCAMP: A Community Benchmark and Co-Design Framework for Sustainable SKA-Scale Radio Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project will operate one of the world's largest continuous scientific data systems, sustaining petascale imaging under strict power caps. Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging.</description>

      <title>Ameliorating transient noise bursts in gravitational-wave searches for intermediate-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct observation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) populations would not only strengthen the possible evolutionary link between stellar and supermassive black holes, but unveil the details of the pair-instability mechanism and elucidate their influence in galaxy formation. Conclusive observation of IMBHs remained elusive until the detection of gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW190521, which lies with high confidence in the mass gap predicted by the pair-instability mechanism. Despite falling in the sensitivity band of current GW detectors, IMBH searches are challenging due to their similarity to transient bursts of detector noise, known as glitches. In this proof-of-concept work, we combine a matched-filter algorithm with a Machine Learning (ML) method to differentiate IMBH signals from non-transient burst noise, known as glitches. In particular, we build a multi-layer perceptron network to perform a multi-class classification of the output triggers of matched-filter. In this way we are able to distinguish simulated GW IMBH signals from different classes of glitches that occurred during the third observing run (O3) {in single detector data}. {We train, validate, and test our model on O3a data, reaching a true positive rate of over $90\%$ for simulated IMBH signals. To test the generalization ability over the evolutionary observing run, we test on the useen data of O3b, which yields a true positive rate of over $70\%$} . We also combine data from multiple detectors to search for simulated IMBH signals in real detector noise, providing a significance measure for the output of our ML method.</description>

      <title>Dual-Backend Multibeam Position Switching Targeted SETI Observations toward Nearby Active Planet-Hosting Systems with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within diversified drift rate ranges and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10% and 50%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Satellite Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</description>

      <title>The HIP 54515 b Superjovian Planet as an Early, Critical Look at the Roman Coronagraph's Performance in the Faint Target Star, Small IWA Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $\Delta$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.</description>

      <title>General Fourier expansion of post-Newtonian binary dynamics based on a quasi-Keplerian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new method for computing gravitational-wave emission from nonspinning binaries which systematically unifies the various integrals arising in the Fourier expansions of post-Newtonian dynamics, providing a simple, practical scheme for calculations at arbitrary precision. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, when radiation-reaction effects is not included, we found that the tail contribution to the energy and angular momentum fluxes can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression with the help of the new method. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Parameters of Massive Stars from Light Curves with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size. Further progress will require expanded datasets of matched photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Assessing signal cross talk between extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and Galactic binaries in LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between 1-1000s extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year. Due to the simultaneous presence of other gravitational wave signals in the data, it can be challenging to detect EMRIs and accurately estimate their parameters. In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries can contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable to that expected in Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Spacecraft Angular Rate Estimation via Event-Based Camera Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for determining spacecraft angular rates using event-based camera sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.</description>
