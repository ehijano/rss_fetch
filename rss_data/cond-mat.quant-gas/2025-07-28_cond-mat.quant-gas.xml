      <title>A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</description>

      <title>Low-energy atomic scattering: s-wave relation between the interaction potential and the phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</description>

      <title>Anomalous fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on fundamental quantum mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Vortices in dipolar condensates of interlayer excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently observed signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of dipolar excitons have drawn enormous attention to excitonic semiconductor bilayers. In superfluids, stabilization and observation of vortex matter is usually a decisive proof of coherent condensation order. However to date, the vortex behavior in a 2D excitonic system with aligned dipole-like interactions that are long-range and everywhere repulsive has not been addressed. We here provide a theoretical description of the vortex characteristics, interaction, and lattices in a dipolar exciton superfluid, solving the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, while varying the exciton dipole moments and the exciton density - both tunable in the experiment, by interlayer separation and gating, respectively. We draw particular attention to the appearance of a maximum in the density redistribution around the edge of each vortex, in the phase-space region where the dipole interactions are particularly strong, and where a transition to an incompressible exciton supersolid is expected.</description>

      <title>Controlled Fission and Superposition of Vector Solitons in an Integrable Model of Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of vector solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates governed by the system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Using a gauge-transformation approach, we construct a four-soliton solution and analyze their interactions, including superposition states, fission, and shape-preserving collisions. We explore the ability of time-dependent parameters, such as the intra- and intercomponent interaction coefficients and trapping potential, to control the soliton properties. In particular, we demonstrate controlled four-soliton fission, highlighting its potential applications to quantum data processing and coherent matter-wave transport. The results suggest experimental realization in BEC systems and provide insights into nonlinear wave interactions in multicomponent quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks on Arbitrary Spatial Networks with Rydberg Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation, leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks, which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms, with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in spatial search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <title>Confined density of states, quantum concentration, and electron degeneracy pressure in low-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of the density of states (DOS) in confined nanomaterials. While previous studies often apply a heuristic $L^{3-d}$ confinement factor to bulk DOS expressions, we show that this factor arises naturally from a consistent quantum-mechanical treatment of quasi-dimensional systems. Using a Fermi gas model, we calculate carrier concentration in across different dimensions and introduce the concept of quantum concentration $n_Q$ as a statistical threshold for quantum confinement effect. We further demonstrate that the electron degeneracy pressure -- scaling with $n^{(d+2)/d}$ -- provides a thermodynamic explanation for carrier enhancement under quantum confinement. Our results clarify the origin of DOS modification and provide insights for low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom that play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Single- and Multi-Site Matter-Wave Solitons in 1D Optical Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</description>

      <title>"Depletion" of Superfluid Density: Universal Low-temperature Thermodynamics of Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with anharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature ($T$) dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size ($L$) corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids with an intrinsic connection between finite-$T$ and finite-$L$ effects implying universal scaling, $T^{d+1}$ and $1/L^{d+1}$, respectively, for a large class of thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Emergent Massive Nambu-Goldstone Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>String breaking dynamics in Ising chain with local vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in which each spin coherently interacts with its phononic mode. The model is motivated by quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in tweezers or trapped ions. The configuration of two domain walls simulates the particle-antiparticle connecting string. We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type equation for quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local occupation number operators is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuum limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a kinetic equation for the Wigner function, which corresponds to a special case of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation without energy conservation. Our main result is the solution to the kinetic equation, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.</description>

      <title>On the non-integrability of driven-dissipative one-dimensional hard-core bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question whether hard-core bosons, equivalent to the XX-model, remain integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider the lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show, using random matrix theory, that the statistics of the complex spacial ratios indicate that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe pattern in the Lindbladian spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Localization Transition for Interacting Quantum Particles in Colored-Noise Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition of interacting particles in a one-dimensional correlated disorder system. The disorder which we investigate allows for vanishing backwards scattering processes. We derive by two renormalization group procedures its phase diagram and predict that the localization transition point is shifted from finite attractive interaction to the non-interacting point. We finally show numerically that the scaling of the localization length with the disorder strength deviates from the usual scaling of a localized phase.</description>
