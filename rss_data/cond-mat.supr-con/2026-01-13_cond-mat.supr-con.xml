      <title>Theoretical Prediction of optimal $T_c$ for Nickelate $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sm_{x}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the nickel-based superconductor $T_c$ record was updated to $96\ \text{K}$ in bilayer $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sm_{x}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ (LSNO) under pressure, raising a critical question: Can its $T_c$ exceed the 164 K benchmark of copper-based superconductors? We find that both monoclinic and tetragonal LSNO have an octahedral quantum well structure (determining $T_c$) nearly identical to $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$ (YBCO). Based on the formula $T_c = \Lambda/\xi^{2}$ (Planck ground-state quantum well oscillator hypothesis, $\xi$ = lattice parameter-determined quantum well depth), we predict Sm-doped nickelate $T_c$ values of $93.4\ \text{K}$ (monoclinic) and $97.1\ \text{K}$ (tetragonal), in excellent agreement with experimental data ($92\ \text{K}$ and $96\ \text{K}$). Notably, despite distinct composition and symmetry (LSNO: $P2_1/m$; YBCO: $Pmmm$), their $\xi$ ($3.6629\ \AA$ vs $3.6720\ \AA$) and $T_c$ ($92\ \text{K}$ vs $93\ \text{K}$) are nearly identical. This validates the proposed superconducting formula and unifies copper-based and nickel-based superconductors at the angstrom-scale octahedral quantum well. Further predictions indicate the maximum achievable $T_c$ for lanthanide-based nickelates (regardless of layer number) is $\sim100\ \text{K}$.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave in a correlated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) in a correlated regime, we employ the Green's functions formalism, as well as the Hubbard-I approximation, as a way to introduce the correlations into the problem, in the form of a repulsive Coulomb interaction $U$. In addition, we investigate the effects of second-nearest neighbor hopping $t_1$ on a pure CDW state. The analysis of the results show that, for small values of $t_1$, both CDW and superconducting gaps compete for the same region on the Fermi surface. The increase of $t_1$ decreases the competition and may lead the system to a coexistence regime. Effects of temperature in the coexistence regime, are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films grown on SrF2(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm c}=1.72$ K. The field-induced broadening of the transition and the presence of finite upper critical fields are consistent with type-II superconductivity. We determine the resistively defined upper critical fields for magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the film plane and parameterize their temperature dependence using an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach. For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $\xi_{ab}\approx 55$ nm and $\xi_c\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\mathrm c}\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family.</description>

      <title>Magnetic exchange coupled nonreciprocal devices for cryogenic memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computing power demands continue to grow, superconducting electronics present an opportunity to reduce power consumption by increasing the energy efficiency of digital logic and memory. A key milestone for scaling this technology is the development of efficient superconducting memories. Such devices should be nonvolatile, scalable to high integration density and memory capacity, enable fast and low-power reading and writing operations, and be compatible with the digital logic. We present a versatile device platform to develop such nonvolatile memory devices consisting of an exchange-coupled ultra-thin superconductor encapsulated between two ferromagnetic insulators (FIs). The superconducting exchange coupling, which is tuneable by the relative alignment between the FI magnetizations, enables the switching of superconductivity on and off. We exploit this mechanism to create a superconducting nonvolatile memory where single-cell writing is realized using heat-assisted magnetic recording, and explain how it can become a contender for state-of-the-art superconducting memories. Furthermore, below their critical temperatures, the memory elements show a marked nonreciprocity, with zero magnetic field superconducting diode efficiencies exceeding $\pm$60%, showing the versatility of the proposed devices for superconducting computing.</description>

      <title>Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Casher Effect and the Coherent Flux Tunneling in the Hybrid Charge Quantum Interference Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exploiting the Aharonov-Casher effect we demonstrate a suppression of magnetic flux tunneling in a Hybrid Charge Quantum Interference Device. The main part of this device is two Josephson junctions with a small superconducting island between them. To minimize phase fluctuations across Josephson junctions, this structure is embedded in a compact super-inductive NbN loop. The Interference between the flux tunneling paths is determined by the island-induced charge, which is controlled by an external voltage. The charge sensitive operation of the device is subjected to poisoning by the quasiparticles generated in the NbN film.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals superconducting electronics: materials, devices and circuit integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors - atomically thin crystalline materials that can be stacked into more complex heterostructures - have opened a promising avenue for superconducting electronics thanks to their properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain in other superconducting materials. These include strong resilience to high in-plane fields, electrostatic tuneability, and non-reciprocal transport rooted in inversion-symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Decoupled interband pairing in a bilayer iron-based superconductor evidenced by ultrahigh-resolution ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct experimental evidence of a weakly coupled multiband superconducting state in the bilayer iron-based superconductor ACa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (A = K, Cs) via ultrahigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Remarkably, the K-containing compound exhibits two distinct transition temperatures, corresponding to two separate sets of bilayer-split bands, as evidenced by temperature-dependent superconducting gap and spectral weight near the Fermi energy, while its Cs counterpart displays conventional single transition behavior. These experimental observations are well described by the weakly coupled two-band model of Eilenberger theory, which identifies suppressed interband pairing interactions between the bilayer-split bands as the key mechanism. By exploring quantum phenomena in the weak-coupling limit within a multiband system, our findings pave the way for engineering exotic superconductivity via band-selective pairing control.</description>

      <title>Observation of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in the Type-I Superconductor YbSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry is a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity, typically observed in type-II superconductors. Here, we report evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the type-I superconductor YbSb$_2$. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal spontaneous internal magnetic fields emerging just below the superconducting transition, while transverse-field $\mu$SR confirms a fully gapped type-I superconducting state. Our first-principles calculations identify YbSb$_2$ as a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological metal hosting a Dirac nodal line near the Fermi level. Symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg Landau framework indicates an internally antisymmetric nonunitary triplet (INT) state as the most probable superconducting ground state. Calculations based on an effective low-energy model further demonstrate that this INT state hosts gapless Majorana surface modes, establishing YbSb$_2$ as a topological superconductor. Our results highlight YbSb$_2$ as a unique material platform where type-I superconductivity coexists with triplet-pairing and nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field decouples nodeless surface and nodal bulk orders in PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07493v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective spectroscopic disentanglement of surface and bulk quantum orders remains an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems.</description>

      <title>From perovskite to infinite-layer nickelates: hole concentration from x-ray absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty of determining cation concentrations and oxygen stoichiometry in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has so far prevented clear experimental identification of the nickel electron configuration in the superconducting phase. We used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the successive changes in PrNiO$_x$ thin films at various intermediate stages of topotactic reduction with $x=2-3$. By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films. Overall, our results suggest a complex interplay of hole doping mechanisms resulting from self-doping effects and oxygen non-stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit-Based Adaptation for Credit Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy and Intermediate-Scale Quantum, or NISQ, processors are sensitive to noise, prone to quantum decoherence, and are not yet capable of continuous quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>BEC with two ground-state filling rates for BCS Cooper-pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D Bose gas caused by a temperature dependent energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the energy spectrum of the particles constituting the Bose gas which behaves like an ideal Bose gas when the gap is absent but whose properties are very different when it is present. Explicit formulae are given for the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps which abruptly go to zero at a temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped counterparts with a smoothed drop to zero. In particular, for the undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for every $T_B \leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state, one at $T_c = T_0$ and another with a higher rate at $T_B &lt; T_0$, suggesting something like a {\it two-step} BEC; also, its specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$ and a divergence at $T_B$ with a critical exponent $\alpha=1/2$, which is inherited from the divergence of the temperature derivative of the BCS gap at $T_B$.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Ionic Anharmonicity on Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B$-$C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\text{c}$ values for KRb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\text{B}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.</description>

      <title>Transverse superconducting diode without parity and time-reversal violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by its nonreciprocal nature in critical supercurrents. However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in the Josephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Casher effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Casher effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>
