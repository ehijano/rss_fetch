      <title>Cell-Probe Lower Bounds via Semi-Random CSP Refutation: Simplified and the Odd-Locality Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work (Korten, Pitassi, and Impagliazzo, FOCS 2025) established an insightful connection between static data structure lower bounds, range avoidance of $\text{NC}^0$ circuits, and the refutation of pseudorandom CSP instances, leading to improvements to some longstanding lower bounds in the cell-probe/bit-probe models. Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et al.
  As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient independence, and further this can be efficiently certified. Via suitable shifts in perspectives, this gives applications to cell-probe lower bounds and range avoidance algorithms for $\mathsf{NC}^0$ circuits.</description>

      <title>Approximating the quantum value of an LCS game is RE-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize H\r{a}stad's long-code test for projection games and show that it remains complete and sound against entangled provers.
  Combined with a result of Dong et al. \cite{Dong25}, which establishes that $\MIP^*=\RE$ with constant-length answers, we derive that $\LIN^*_{1-\epsilon,s}=\RE$, for some $1/2&lt; s&lt;1$ and for every sufficiently small $\epsilon&gt;0$, where LIN refers to linearity (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) of the verifier predicate. Achieving the same result with $\epsilon=0$ would imply the existence of a non-hyperlinear group.</description>

      <title>Reducing the complexity of computing the values of a Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Colonel Blotto game, formulated by Emile Borel, involves players allocating limited resources to multiple battlefields simultaneously, with the winner being the one who allocates more resources to each battlefield. Computation of the Nash equilibrium, including of two person, zero sum, mixed strategy Colonel Blotto games have encountered issues of scalability and complexity owing to their PPAD completeness. This paper proposes an algorithm that computes the same value as the Nash equilibrium but cannot be characterized by the Fixed point Theorems of Tarski, Kakutani and Brouwer. The reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm is based on dispensing with the need for computing both players Nash strategies in Colonel Blotto games. The same algorithm can, therefore, be extended to all two person, zero sum games to compute the value of the Nash equilibrium. The theoretical superiority of the proposed algorithm over both LP solvers and another method that computes the same value of the game as its Nash equilibrium by a random assignment of probabilities to the active strategy set of the defending player, is also proposed.</description>
