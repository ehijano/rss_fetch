      <title>Theoretical description of proton-deuteron interactions using exact two-body dynamic of femtoscopic correlation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling proton-deuteron interactions is particularly challenging. Due the deuteron's large size, the interaction can extend over several femtometers. The degree to which it can be modeled as a two-body problem might also be questioned. One way to study these interactions is through femtoscopic correlation measurements of particle pairs, extracting information using available theoretical models. In this work, we examine two approaches for describing proton-deuteron correlations: the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formalism and full numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation. Our results show that the differences between these methods are significant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating higher-order partial waves-particularly p-wave -is the essential for accurately capturing the dynamics of proton-deuteron interactions and the full potential of the strong force.</description>

      <title>Structure of nuclei in dileptons production in proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate production of electron-positron pairs (dileptons) in the scattering of protons off nuclei. Focus is directed on clarifying role of nuclear interactions which make basis in mechanisms of scattering process and structure of nuclei. For that, we constructed a new model of production of dileptons, where scattering of nuclei and their structure are described on the basis of quantum mechanics. Cross sections of dilepton production are calculated in the scattering of protons on \isotope[9]{B} at energy of proton beam of 2.1~GeV. Tendency of the calculated full spectrum is in good agreement with experimental data of DLS Collaboration. Contribution of incoherent processes has a leading role in production of dileptons in comparison with coherent one. In our model calculated cross section of dileptons is sensitive to nuclear part of potential of interactions between proton and nucleus in scattering. Influence of structure of nucleus on calculations of cross sections of production of dileptons is essential. This result provides save basis for new opportunity to extract new information about structure of nuclei, nuclear part of potential from experimental data of dileptons at studied energies of proton beam.</description>

      <title>Neutron-proton pairing in the unstable N=Z nuclei of the f-shell through two-nucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair transfer is a unique tool to study pairing correlations in nuclei. Neutron-proton pairing is investigated in the N=Z nuclei of the f-shell, through the reaction (p,3He) in inverse kinematics, that allows to populate at the same time the lowest J=0+, T=1 (isovector pairing) state and J=1+, T=0 (isoscalar pairing) state. Radioactive beams of 56Ni and 52Fe produced by fragmentation at the GANIL/LISE facility combined with particle and gamma-ray detection make it possible to carry out this study from 48Cr (mid-shell nucleus) to 56Ni (doubly-magic nucleus). The cross-sections were extracted and compared with second-order distorted-wave born approximation (DWBA) calculations performed with neutron-proton amplitudes obtained from shell model calculations with GXPF1 interaction. Very low cross-sections for the J=1+,T=0 state (isoscalar channel) were observed. The cross-section for 56Ni is one of order of magnitude lower than for 40Ca showing a strong reduction of the isoscalar channel in the f-shell as compared to the sd-shell. On the other hand, the increase of the cross-section towards the middle of the shell for the isovector channel points towards a possible superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Nature of X(3872) from recent BESIII data: Considering the universal feature of an S-wave threshold resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory with continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework for SU(2) lattice gauge theory, leveraging continuous variables instead of discrete qubits to represent the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the gauge fields. We consider a ladder as well as a two-dimensional grid of plaquettes, detailing the use of gauge fixing to reduce the degrees of freedom and simplify the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the system dynamics, ground states, and energy gaps can be computed using the continuous-variable approach to quantum computing. Our results indicate that it is feasible to study non-Abelian gauge theories with continuous variables, providing new avenues for understanding the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>The interplay of astrophysics and nuclear physics in determining the properties of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star properties depend on both nuclear physics and astrophysical processes, and thus observations of neutron stars offer constraints on both large-scale astrophysics and the behavior of cold, dense matter. In this study, we use astronomical data to jointly infer the universal equation of state of dense matter along with two distinct astrophysical populations: Galactic neutron stars observed electromagnetically and merging neutron stars in binaries observed with gravitational waves. We place constraints on neutron star properties and quantify the extent to which they are attributable to macrophysics or microphysics. We confirm previous results indicating that the Galactic and merging neutron stars have distinct mass distributions. The inferred maximum mass of both Galactic neutron stars, $M_{\rm pop, EM}=2.05^{+0.11}_{-0.06}\,M_{\odot}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible interval), and merging neutron star binaries, $M_{\rm pop, GW}=1.85^{+0.39}_{-0.16}\,M_{\odot}$, are consistent with the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars set by nuclear physics, $M_{\rm TOV} =2.28^{+0.41}_{-0.21}\,M_\odot$. The radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star is $12.2^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\,$km, consistent with, though $\sim 20\%$ tighter than, previous results using an identical equation of state model. Even though observed Galactic and merging neutron stars originate from populations with distinct properties, there is currently no evidence that astrophysical processes cannot produce neutron stars up to the maximum value imposed by nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of correlations on nuclear binding energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong effort will be dedicated in the coming years to extend the reach of ab initio nuclear-structure calculations to heavy doubly open-shell nuclei. In order to do so, the most efficient strategies to incorporate dominant many-body correlations at play in such nuclei must be identified. With this motivation in mind, the present work pedagogically analyses the inclusion of many-body correlations and their impact on binding energies of Calcium and Chromium isotopes. Employing an empirically-optimal Hamiltonian built from chiral effective field theory, binding energies along both isotopic chains are studied via a hierarchy of approximations based on polynomially-scaling expansion many-body methods. The corresponding results are compared to experimental data and to those obtained via valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations at the normal-ordered two-body level that act as a reference in the present study. The spherical mean-field approximation is shown to display specific shortcomings in Ca isotopes that can be understood analytically and that are efficiently corrected via the consistent addition of low-order dynamical correlations on top of it. While the same setting cannot appropriately reproduce binding energies in doubly open-shell Cr isotopes, allowing the unperturbed mean-field state to break rotational symmetry permits to efficiently capture the static correlations responsible for the phenomenological differences observed between the two isotopic chains. Eventually, the present work demonstrates in a pedagogical way that polynomially-scaling expansion methods based on unperturbed states that possibly break (and restore) symmetries constitute an optimal route to extend ab initio calculations to heavy closed- and open-shell nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel input scheme for general second-quantized Hamiltonians of relativistic or non-relativistic many-fermion systems. This input scheme incorporates the fermionic anticommutation relations, particle number variations, and respects the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Based on our input scheme, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for spectral calculations on future quantum hardwares. We provide explicit circuit designs and the associated gate cost. We demonstrate our hybrid framework by solving the low-lying spectra of ${^{42}}$Ca and ${^{46}}$Ca. Our input scheme provides new pathways to solving the spectra and dynamics of the relativistic and nonrelativistic many-fermion systems via first-principles approaches.</description>

      <title>T-odd Parton Distribution Functions and Azimuthal Anisotropy at High Transverse Momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various azimuthal anisotropies ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$), at high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$), are shown to arise from the asymmetric scattering of transverse polarized quarks and gluons, arising from unpolarized nucleons (the Boer-Mulders' effect) and resulting in unpolarized hadrons (the Collins effect). Combined with the asymmetric scattering of partons from polarization independent but transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions, we obtain a possible mechanism to understand the azimuthal anisotropy of hadrons at large transverse momentum observed in $p$-$p$ collisions. Constraining the ratio of polarization dependent TMD distributions to polarization independent distributions by comparing with the data from $p$-$p$ collisions, we find that a simple $A^{1/3}$ enhancement of the intrinsic transverse momentum $(k_\perp^2)$ distribution, of the initial state partons from the proton, straightforwardly yields the azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ in $p$-$A$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>
