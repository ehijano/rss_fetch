      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum III: Precessing Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically and solved for both rotating and librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs) with high eccentricities. We describe the finding of a striking similarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession rates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC frequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve the resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and explain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the regular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple pendulum.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO observations of the debris-accreting white dwarf WD\,0141--675</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Linear bending wave propagation in laminar and turbulent discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.</description>

      <title>Various Modifications to Debye-H\"uckel Interactions in Solar Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first order effect of Coulomb forces between the charged particles of a plasma is the well-known Debye-H\"uckel-term. It is a negative contribution to the pressure and energy of the gas, that at high densities will overwhelm the ideal gas contributions and make the gas implode into a black hole. Nature obviously constrains this term, avoiding this fate, but how? We investigate three different mechanisms and their effects on the equation of state and on solar models, and the physical justifications for each of them. We conclude that higher order Coulomb terms in combination with quantum diffraction of electrons, provide the needed convergence.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar emission radius at 42 MHz during the 2024 total solar eclipse using a student-commissioned radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency solar radio emission is sourced in the solar corona, with sub-100 MHz radio emission largely originating from the $\sim$10$^{5}$\,$\mathrm{K}$ plasma around 2 optical radii. However, the region of emission has yet to be constrained at 35--45\,MHz due to both instrumentation limitations and the rarity of astronomical events, such as total solar eclipses, which allow for direct observational approaches. In this work, we present the results from a student-led project to commission a low-frequency radio telescope array situated in the path of totality of the 2024 total solar eclipse in an effort to probe the middle corona. The Deployable Low-Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (DLITE) is a low-frequency radio array comprised of four dipole antennas, optimized to observe at 35--45\,MHz, and capable of resolving the brightest radio sources in the sky. We constructed a DLITE station in Observatory Park, a dark sky park in Montville, Ohio. Results of observations during the total solar eclipse demonstrate that DLITE stations can be quickly deployed for observations and provide constraints on the radius of solar emission at our center observing frequency of 42\,MHz. In this work, we outline the construction of DLITE Ohio and the solar observation results from the total solar eclipse that transversed North America in April 2024.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar properties of massive stars in NGC346 in the SMC with a Bayesian statistic technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 346 is a young cluster with numerous hot OB stars. It is part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and has an average metallicity that is one-seventh of the Milky Way's. A detailed study of its stellar content provides a unique opportunity to understand the stellar and wind properties of massive stars in low-metallicity environments, and enables us to improve our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution.
  The fundamental stellar parameters defining a star's spectral appearance are its effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Unfortunately, these parameters cannot be obtained independently from only H and He spectral features as they are partially degenerate. With this work we aim to overcome this degeneracy by applying a newly developed Bayesian statistic technique that can fit these three parameters simultaneously.
  Multi-epoch optical spectra are used in combination with a Bayesian statistic technique to fit stellar properties based on a publicly available grid of synthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The use of all of the multi-epoch observations simultaneously allows the identification of binaries.
  The stellar parameters for 34 OB stars within the core of NGC 346 are derived and presented here. By the use of both $\mathrm{He}\textsc{i}$ and $\mathrm{He}\textsc{ii}$ lines, the partial degeneracy between the stellar parameters of effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity is overcome. A lower limit to the binary fraction of the sample of stars is found to be at least 46%.
  Based on comparisons with analysis conducted on an overlapping sample of stars within NGC 346, the Bayesian statistic technique approach is shown to be a viable method to measure stellar parameters for hot massive stars in low-metallicity environments even when only low-resolution spectra are available.}</description>

      <title>The coupled tearing-thermal instability in coronal current sheets from the linear to the non-linear stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the solar corona, magnetically sheared structures are unstable to both tearing and thermal instabilities in a coupled fashion. However, how the choice of linear perturbation modes influences the time-scale to achieve the thermal runaway in a coupled tearing-thermal coronal current sheet is not well understood to date. Here, we model a force-free Harris current sheet under solar coronal conditions to investigate this coupling in the linear and non-linear regimes. In the linear regime, we adopt the magnetohydrodynamic spectroscopy code Legolas to compare the current sheet under thermal and thermoresistive conditions, after which we initialise non-linear simulations (with MPI-AMRVAC) with the unstable, linear tearing and thermal perturbations obtained with Legolas. It is shown that part of the unstable thermal quasi-continuum adopts tearing properties in the linear stage, but that it is not until the non-linear stage is reached that a true thermal 'runaway' effect leads to condensations inside tearing-induced flux ropes. Hence, the linear stage is governed by the dominant tearing instability whilst condensations form due to tearing-thermal coupling in the non-linear stage. Our results imply that perturbing an equilibrium current sheet with the fastest growing linear mode skips the mode mixing phase in which the dominant instability traditionally emerges, and significantly reduces the time-scale to enter into the non-linear stage and thermal runaway process from its equilibrium configuration.</description>

      <title>M dwarfs quasi-periodic pulsations at a time resolution of 1 s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) of Sun and stars are challenging for stellar flare models. The white light stellar QPPs in the periodicity region of tens of second are unexplored yet. On the basis of observations with the 6-m telescope BTA in U-band of flaring dM-stars EV Lac, Wolf 359, Wolf 424, V577 Mon and UV Ceti we found 13 new QPPs. This composes 30% occurrence among 44 worked flares. These QPPs were found to have periods ranging from 6 to 107 seconds and were detected using both Fourier transform and empirical mode decomposition methods. The observed QPPs were categorized by the evolution of their oscillation envelope and fractional flux amplitudes. There are shown the statistically significant correlations of the QPP period with the duration, the equivalent duration and the amplitude of a flare, and the correlation between the QPP amplitude and flare amplitude.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Simulation of the 2013 April 11 SEP Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can pose hazardous radiation risks to both humans in space and spacecraft electronics. Numerical modeling based on first principles offers valuable insights into SEPs, providing synthetic observables for SEPs at any time and location in space. In this work, we present a high-resolution scheme based on integral relations for Poisson brackets to solve the kinetic equation for particle acceleration and transport processes. We implement this scheme within the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), developed at the University of Michigan, to conduct a comprehensive study of solar energetic protons during the 2013 April 11 SEP event. In addition, a shock capturing tool is developed to study the coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock starting from the low solar corona. Multi-point spacecraft observations, including SOHO/ERNE, SDO/AIA, GOES and ACE at Earth, and STEREO-A/B, are used for model-data comparison and validation. New synthetic observables such as white-light images, shock geometry and properties, as well as SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra provide insights for SEP studies. The influences of the mean free path on SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra are also discussed. The results demonstrate: (1) the successful implementation of the Poisson bracket scheme with a self-consistent particle tracker within the SWMF, (2) the capability of capturing the time-evolving shock surface in the SWMF, and (3) the complexity of the mean free path impacts on SEPs. Overall, this study contributes to both scientific research and operational objectives by advancing our understanding of particle behaviors and showing the readiness for more accurate SEP predictions.</description>

      <title>Gaia20bdk -- a new FUor in Sh 2-301 Star Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We analyse multi-colour photometric and spectroscopic observations of a Young Stellar Object Gaia20bdk. Aims. We aim to investigate the exact nature of the eruptive phenomenon that the star has been experiencing since 2018. Methods. We use public-domain archival photometry to characterise the quiescent phase in order to establish major physical parameters of the progenitor. Then, we use our and public-domain optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy to study the outburst. Results. Gaia20bdk is a member of the Sharpless 2-301 star-forming region, at a distance of 3.3 kpc. The progenitor is a rather massive 2.7 solar mass, G7-type Class I young star having an effective temperature of 5300 K and bolometric luminosity of 11 solar luminosities. The optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic data obtained during the outburst show a variety of signatures commonly found in classical FUors. Our disc modelling results in a bolometric luminosity of 100-200 solar luminosities and mass accretion rate of 1-2e-5 solar masses per year, also confirming the object's FUor classification. Further monitoring is necessary to track the light changes, accretion rate and spectral variations, as well as to understood the mechanisms behind the disc flickering.</description>

      <title>Runaway O and Be stars found using Gaia DR3, new stellar bow shocks and search for binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaways, moving with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. Kicks from supernova explosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the runaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution of massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway stars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC and 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these catalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25% for O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion scenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We have used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the runaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these bow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting detailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing project to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and search for high-energy binary systems.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Cataclysmic Variables in the Solar Neighborhood in the Gaia Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and updated systemic velocities from the literature, kinematical properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) were investigated. By constraining the data according to the total space velocity error and Galactic population class, a reliable sample of data was obtained. Non-magnetic CVs located in the thin disk have been found to have a total space velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\nu} = 46.33\pm4.23$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that the thin disk CVs with a mean kinematical age of $\tau = 3.95\pm0.75$ Gyr are much younger than the local thin disk of the Galaxy with $\tau\sim$6-9 Gyr. Total space velocity dispersions of non-magnetic CVs belonging to the thin disk component of the Galaxy were found to be $\sigma_{\nu}=47.67\pm3.94$ and $\sigma_{\nu}=44.43\pm4.33$ km s$^{-1}$ for the systems below and above the orbital period gap, respectively, corresponding to kinematical ages of $\tau=4.19\pm0.71$ and $\tau=3.61\pm0.74$ Gyr. $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the thin disk CVs below and above the gap were obtained $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This study also shows that the orbital period is decreasing with increasing age, as expected from the standard theory. The age-orbital period relation for non-magnetic thin disk CVs was obtained as $dP/dt=-2.09\pm0.22\times10^{-5}$ sec yr$^{-1}$. However, a significant difference could not be found between the $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the systems below and above the gap, which were calculated to be $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dazzle: Oversampled Image Reconstruction and Difference-Imaging Photometry for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present algorithms and software for constructing high-precision difference images to detect and measure transients, such as microlensing events, in crowded stellar fields using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our method generates difference images by subtracting an over-sampled reference, with iterative masking to address outlier pixels. We also provide an analytic correction for small dither offset errors. Microlensing event detection is achieved through a three-dimensional matched-filtering technique, optimized with Gaussian kernels to capture varying event durations, and verified through synthetic tests with high recovery rates. Transient photometry is performed via PSF fitting on difference images, using Nelder-Mead optimization for sub-pixel accuracy. The software, Dazzle, is available as an open-source Python package built on widely used libraries, offering accessible tools for the detection and characterization of transient phenomena in crowded fields.</description>

      <title>Epsilon Canis Majoris: The Brightest EUV Source with Surprisingly Low Interstellar Absorption</title>

Abstract: The B2 star $\epsilon$ CMa, at parallax distance $d = 124\pm2$~pc, dominates the H I photoionization of the local interstellar cloud (LIC). At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, $\epsilon$ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude $M_V =-3.97\pm0.04$. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux $f = (41.5\pm3.3) \times 10^{-6}~{\rm erg~cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and angular diameter $\theta_d = 0.80\pm0.05$~mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius $R = 10.7\pm0.7~R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13.1\pm2.3~M_{\odot}$, gravity $\log g = 3.50\pm0.05$, effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} \approx 21,000$~K, and luminosity $L \approx 20,000~L_{\odot}$. These parameters place Epsilon CMa outside the $\beta$ Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed EUV spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit ($\Delta_{\rm LL} = 5000\pm500$) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere ($\Delta_{\rm star} = 110\pm10$) and interstellar medium ($\Delta_{\rm ISM} = 45\pm5$) with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 3.8\pm0.1$. After correcting for interstellar HI column density $N_{\rm HI} = (6\pm1)\times10^{17}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, we find a stellar LyC photon flux $\Phi_{\rm LyC} \approx 3000~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and ionizing luminosity $Q_{\rm LyC} = 10^{45.7\pm0.3}$ photons s$^{-1}$. The photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm H} \approx$ (1-2)$\times 10^{-14}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30-40\%) for total hydrogen density $n_{\rm H} = 0.2$ cm$^{-3}$. With its $27.3\pm0.4$ km/s heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, $\epsilon$ CMa passed within $9.3\pm0.5$ pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.</description>

      <title>Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Young 2 Cygni Run-away Star into a Binary using iLocater</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs that use adaptive optics (AO) show promise to advance telescope observing capabilities beyond those of seeing-limited designs. We are building a spectrograph for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) named iLocater that uses AO to inject starlight directly into single mode fibers (SMF). iLocater's first acquisition camera system (the `SX' camera), which receives light from one of the 8.4m diameter primary mirrors of the LBT, was initially installed in summer 2019 and has since been used for several commissioning runs. We present results from first-light observations that include on-sky measurements as part of commissioning activities. Imaging measurements of the bright B3IV star 2 Cygni ($V=4.98$) resulted in the direct detection of a candidate companion star at an angular separation of only $\theta = 70$ mas. Follow-up AO measurements using Keck/NIRC2 recover the candidate companion in multiple filters. An $R\approx1500$ miniature spectrograph recently installed at the LBT named ``Lili'' provides spatially resolved spectra of each binary component, indicating similar spectral types and strengthening the case for companionship. Studying the multiplicity of young runaway star systems like 2 Cygni ($36.6 \pm 0.5$ Myr) can help to understand formation mechanisms for stars that exhibit anomalous velocities through the galaxy. This on-sky demonstration illustrates the spatial resolution of the iLocater SX acquisition camera working in tandem with the LBT AO system; it further derisks a number of technical hurdles involved in combining AO with Doppler spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The impact on astrometry by solar-wind effect in pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry of pulsars, particularly their distances, serves as a critical input for various astrophysical experiments using pulsars. Pulsar timing is a primary approach for determining a pulsar's position, parallax, and distance. In this paper, we explore the influence of the solar wind on astrometric measurements obtained through pulsar timing, focusing on its potential to affect the accuracy of these parameters. Using both theoretical calculation and mock-data simulations, we demonstrate a significant correlation between the pulsar position, annual parallax and the solar-wind density parameters. This correlation strongly depends on the pulsar's ecliptic latitude. We show that fixing solar-wind density to an arbitrary value in the timing analysis can introduce significant bias in the estimated pulsar position and parallax, and its significance is highly dependent on the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar and the timing precision of the data. For pulsars with favourable ecliptic latitude and timing precision, the astrometric and solar-wind parameters can be measured jointly with other timing parameters using single-frequency data. The parameter correlation can be mitigated by using multi-frequency data, which also significantly improves the measurement precision of these parameters; this is particularly important for pulsars at a medium or high ecliptic latitude. Additionally, for a selection of pulsars we reprocess their EPTA Data Release 2 data to include modelling of solar-wind effect in the timing analysis. This delivers significant measurements of both parallax and solar-wind density, the latter of which are consistent with those obtained at low-frequency band. In the future, combining pulsar timing data at gigahertz and lower frequencies will probably deliver the most robust and precise measurements of astrometry and solar wind properties in pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>Torsional Alfven Oscillation in the Regime of Firehose Instability as a Mechanism of Plasma Stratification in a Laboratory Experiment on Modeling a Coronal Arch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact laboratory stand ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys. of Russ. Acad. Sci.) forms an arch structure of the coronal loop type, in which the plasma pressure varies from zero to values of the order of and above the magnetic pressure. The arc discharge in each of the bases of the magnetic tube creates a plasma that is characterized by a significantly higher ion temperature along the magnetic field line than across the latter one. In the stationary state (when the ion pressure is below the threshold value for rupture of the system at the top of the loop), the plasma is found to be stratified in the form of a cylindrical layer along the outer wall of the tube or possibly two belts along the upper and lower vaults of the arch. The paper discusses the excitation of a torsional Alfven oscillation in the loop in the regime of firehose instability. In the case of rapid growth (with an increment of the order of an ion cyclotron period), the unstable Alfven oscillation essentially reallocates the particles between the central axis and the tube wall, which manifests itself in the form of the observed cylindrical layer.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous emission from dust and gas in the planetary debris orbiting a white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence for the presence and variability of circumstellar dust and gas around white dwarfs that are polluted with exoplanetary material, although the origin of this dust and gas remains debated. This paper presents the first near-simultaneous observations of both circumstellar dust (via broadband emission) and gas (via emission lines) around a polluted white dwarf. From the optical spectra the gaseous emission lines, notably the calcium infrared triplet and magnesium lines, show significant increases and decreases in their strength over timescales of weeks, while the oxygen and iron lines remain relatively stable. Near-infrared JHKs photometry reveals dust emission changes of up to 0.2 magnitudes in the Ks band over similar timescales, marking the shortest variability timescales observed to date. The two epochs with the strongest emission were correlated between the dust (Ks band brightening) and gas (strengthened calcium and magnesium lines), showing for the first time that the dust and gas must be produced near-simultaneously with a common origin, likely in collisions.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. The impact of rotation and magnetic fields on the radial velocity jitter in cool stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) jitter represents an intrinsic limitation on the precision of Doppler searches for exoplanets that can originate from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. We aim to determine the RV jitter floor in M dwarfs and investigate the stellar properties that lead to RV jitter induced by stellar activity. We determined the RV jitter in 239 M dwarfs from the CARMENES survey that are predominantly of mid to late spectral type and solar metallicity. We also investigated the correlation between stellar rotation and magnetic fields with RV jitter. The median jitter in the CARMENES sample is 3.1 m/s, and it is 2.3 m/s for stars with an upper limit of 2 km/s on their projected rotation velocities. We provide a relation between the stellar equatorial rotation velocity and RV jitter in M dwarfs based on a subsample of 129 well-characterized CARMENES stars. RV jitter induced by stellar rotation dominates for stars with equatorial rotation velocities greater than 1 km/s. A jitter floor of 2 m/s dominates in stars with equatorial rotation velocities below 1 km/s. This jitter floor likely contains contributions from stellar jitter, instrumental jitter, and undetected companions. We study the impact of the average magnetic field and the distributions of magnetic filling factors on the RV jitter. We find a series of stars with excess RV jitter and distinctive distributions of magnetic filling factors. These stars are characterized by a dominant magnetic field component between 2-4 kG. An RV jitter floor can be distinguished from RV jitter induced by activity and rotation based on the stellar equatorial rotation velocity. RV jitter induced by activity and rotation primarily depends on the equatorial rotation velocity. This RV jitter is also related to the distribution of magnetic filling factors, and this emphasizes the role of the magnetic field in the generation of RV jitter.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including Galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from main-sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties, namely the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red-giant-branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with age measurements from open clusters and asteroseismology. We use "zoomies" to generate and compare dynamical age estimates for stars from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Radial Velocity and Astrometric Evidence for a Close Companion to Betelgeuse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a century of radial velocity, visual magnitude, and astrometric observations of the nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse, in order to reexamine the century-old assertion that Betelgeuse might be a spectroscopic binary. These data reveal Betelgeuse varying stochastically over years and decades due to its boiling, convective envelope, periodically with a $ 5.78$~yr long secondary period, and quasi-periodically from pulsations with periods of several hundred days. We show that the long secondary period is consistent between astrometric and RV datasets, and argue that it indicates a low-mass companion to Betelgeuse, less than a solar mass, orbiting in a 2,110 day period at a separation of just over twice Betelgeuse's radius. The companion star would be nearly twenty times less massive and a million times fainter than Betelgeuse, with similar effective temperature, effectively hiding it in plain sight near one of the best-studied stars in the night sky. The astrometric data favor an edge-on binary with orbital plane aligned with Betelgeuse's measured spin axis. Tidal spin-orbit interaction drains angular momentum from the orbit and spins up Betelgeuse, explaining the spin--orbit alignment and Betelgeuse's anomalously rapid spin. In the future, the orbit will decay until the companion is swallowed by Betelgeuse in the next 10,000 years.</description>

Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of Bernhard-2, which was previously identified as a candidate system to host a misaligned circumbinary disk. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm that Bernhard-2 indeed contains an eccentric ($e=0.69 \pm 0.08$) binary and thus that the periodic variability in the photometric light curve is best explained by the occultation by the misaligned circumbinary disk. By modeling the spectral energy distributions at different phases, we infer the masses of the two binary components to be $\sim 1.1\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. The system age is determined to be $\lesssim$ 20 Myr by combining the stellar isochrone model with lithium abundance. Our new photometric observations show clear deviations from the model prediction based on the archival data, suggesting ongoing precession of the circumbinary disk. The H$\alpha$ line of Bernhard-2 also shows an inverse P-Cygni profile at epochs close to the pericenter passage, which could be attributed to the pulsed accretion around the pericenter. Bernhard-2 therefore closely resembles the well studied KH 15D system. Further detailed observations and studies of such rare systems can provide useful information about disk physics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Investigating the asymmetry of young stellar outflows: Combined MUSE-X-shooter study of the Th 28 jet</title>

Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution along the AGB as revealed by the shape of Miras' visual light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new analysis of a sample of visual light curves of Mira variables is presented. The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the AAVSO database as including a very large number of high-density and high-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise, more quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier studies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new correlations between the shapes of the light curves and the evolution of the star along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal curves associated with M spectral types and displaying no sign of having experienced third-dredge-up events, is identified with good confidence. A detailed study of its properties is presented and used to suggest possible interpretations. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and usually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum, progressively taking the form of a hump climbing the ascending branch as the star evolves along the AGB. The properties displayed by this hump are studied in some detail and possible interpretations are considered. New correlations between parameters defining the shape of the light curve and the state of the star are revealed; while the average trend is established with good confidence, deviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the shapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying physics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope that they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on simulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>

Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen emission lines are routinely used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars. Despite the clear correlation between the accretion luminosity of a star and hydrogen line luminosities, the physical origin of these lines is still unclear, with magnetospheric accretion and magneto-centrifugal winds as the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra, we have analysed the SED and emission line spectra of five sources in order to determine their underlying photospheric properties, and to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We have fitted the SED of the five sources employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate $T_{eff}$, $R_{*}$, $M_{*}$ and $A(V)$ for each source. We have performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund, totalling $\ge 15$ lines. The FWHM and optical depth of the spectrally resolved lines have been studied in order to constrain the emission origin. The five sources all have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We have classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their effective temperature. Their hydrogen lines show broad profiles with FWHMs $\ge 200$ km s$^{-1}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with lower $n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high velocity component of each line, becoming optically thin in the low velocity component. This is consistent with emission from a magnetospheric accretion flow, and cannot be explained as originating in a magneto-centrifugal wind, or other line emission mechanisms thought to be present in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>
