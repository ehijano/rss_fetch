      <title>DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.</description>

      <title>GegenbauerNet: Finding the Optimal Compromise in the GNN Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.</description>

      <title>THD-BAR: Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling for EEG Generic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Compute-in-Memory Implementation of State Space Models for Event Sequence Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multicarrier Cognitive Radio ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion of cognitive radio (CR) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enabled by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), offers a promising path for multi-functional programmable front ends in 6G and beyond. In this paper we propose a novel CR-ISAC framework that leverages an SIM integrated with the secondary base station (SB) to learn and realize optimal beampatterns that simultaneously (i) minimize the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) for localizing a secondary user equipment (SU) and (ii) limit averaged interference at primary user equipments (PUs) so that spectral efficiency loss is constrained, with the target of at most a few percent degradation. We propose an efficient alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain the optimal end-to-end transmission response of the SIM for all orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. Drawing an analogy between the layered SIM architecture and deep neural networks, we define a beampattern- matching loss, derive analytical gradients for backpropagation, and implement a learning-based optimization of the SIM coefficients using a mini-batch Adam optimizer. A complexity analysis is provided, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed CR-ISAC framework. The results show that the proposed SIM coefficient optimization methods attain near-optimal performance in terms of both the SU BCRB localization metric and the PUs average spectral efficiency when the SIM has a sufficient number of layers, and they substantially outperform traditional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designs.</description>

      <title>Cross-Sparsity-Enabled Multipath Perception via Structured Bayesian Inference for Multi-Target Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-target sensing system in multipath environment, where inter-target scattering gives rise to first-order reflected paths whose angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) coincide with the direct-path angles of different targets. Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multi-task CNN for ECG Diagnosis with GRU-Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for real-time Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification on edge devices, existing models face challenges of high computational cost and limited accuracy on imbalanced datasets.This paper presents Multi-task DFNet, a lightweight multi-task framework for ECG classification across the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, enabling efficient task collaboration by dynamically sharing knowledge across tasks, such as arrhythmia detection, myocardial infarction (MI) classification, and other cardiovascular abnormalities. The proposed method integrates GRU-augmented Diffusion, where the GRU is embedded within the diffusion model to capture temporal dependencies better and generate high-quality synthetic signals for imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that Multi-task DFNet achieves 99.72% and 99.89% accuracy on the MIT-BIH dataset and PTB dataset, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters compared to traditional models, making it suitable for deployment on wearable ECG monitors. This work offers a compact and efficient solution for multi-task ECG diagnosis, providing a promising potential for edge healthcare applications on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>A Patient-Independent Neonatal Seizure Prediction Model Using Reduced Montage EEG and ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Integrated Positioning and Communication for Cooperative Multi-LEO Uplink Communications: A Dual-Timescale Kalman Filter-Aided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are a crucial component of the future non-terrestrial networks (NTN) due to lower latency, robust signal strengths, shorter revisit times, and dense constellations. However, acquiring reliable channel state information (CSI) in LEO satellite communication remains challenging owing to severe signal attenuation over long propagation distances and short coherence times. Despite these challenges, LEO channels benefit from pronounced line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties inherently tied to positioning information. In this work, we propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for multi-LEO satellite networks to address the unique challenges posed by LEO channels. Specifically, we leverage in-the-loop LEO positioning to exploit users' position information for improving uplink CSI acquisition. To overcome the link-budget limitations of single-satellite systems, cooperative multi-LEO uplink data detection is adopted. By exploiting the different coherent timescales of position-related parameters and random channel gains, we develop a dual-timescale Kalman filter-based IPAC framework: an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for tracking users' position and velocity in the large-timescale, and a Kalman filter that leverages the position information obtained in the large-timescale for improved data-aided uplink channel estimation in the small-timescale. Finally, the two tasks of channel estimation and cooperative data detection are jointly addressed through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IPAC approach outperforms the conventional baseline in terms of channel estimation accuracy and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Covariance-based Imaging and Multi-View Fusion for Networked Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers multi-view imaging in a sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication network, which consists of a transmit base-station (BS), multiple receive BSs connected to a central processing unit (CPU), and multiple extended targets. Our goal is to devise an effective multi-view imaging technique that can jointly leverage the targets' echo signals at all the receive BSs to precisely construct the image of these targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances imaging performance, facilitating high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Learning-Based Radio Map Reconstruction for Fingerprinting Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a feature-guided adversarial framework, namely ComGAN, which is designed to reconstruct an incomplete fingerprint database by inferring missing received signal strength (RSS) values at unmeasured reference points (RPs). An auxiliary subnetwork is integrated into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to enable spatial feature learning. An optimization method is then developed to refine the RSS predictions by aggregating multiple prediction sets, achieving an improved localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) comparable to the ground-truth measurements while outperforming state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. When the reconstructed fingerprint is combined with measured data for training, the fingerprinting localization achieves accuracy comparable to models trained on fully measured datasets.</description>

      <title>Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Design for Fully-Connected Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel fully-connected (FC) tri-hybrid beamforming (THB) architecture is proposed for pinching antenna systems (PASS). In contrast to conventional sub-connected (SC) PASS, the proposed FC architecture employs a tunable phase-shifter network to interconnect all radio frequency (RF) chains with all waveguides. This facilitates a THB framework that integrates conventional hybrid analog-digital beamforming with pinching beamforming. A weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamformers and pinching antenna (PA) positions. Two algorithms are developed to address this challenging non-convex problem. 1) Fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm: This algorithm directly maximizes the WSR using an FP-based alternating optimization framework. Particularly, a success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) method is proposed to optimize PA positions, effectively addressing the intractable multimodal objective function. 2) Zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm: To reduce design complexity, zero-forcing is employed for transmit beamforming. The PA positions are subsequently optimized to maximize the WSR via a modified SHADE method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, revealing that the FC-THB PASS achieves WSR comparable to the SC architecture while delivering superior energy efficiency with fewer RF chains.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage ISAC Framework for Low-Altitude Economy Based on 5G NR Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of next-generation wireless networks has spurred the vigorous development of the low-altitude economy (LAE). To support this emerging field while remaining compatible with existing network architectures, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on 5G New Radio (NR) signals is regarded as a promising solution. However, merely leveraging standard 5G NR signals, such as the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), presents fundamental limitations in sensing resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine sensing framework that utilizes standard 5G NR initial access signals augmented by a custom-designed sparse pilot structure (SPS) for high-precision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sensing. In Stage I, we first fuse information from the SSB, Type\#0-PDCCH, and system information block 1 (SIB1) to ensure the initial target detection. In Stage II, a refined estimation algorithm is introduced to overcome the resolution limitations of these signals. Inspired by the sparse array theory, this stage employs a novel SPS, which is inserted into resource blocks (RBs) within the CORSET\#0 bandwidth. To accurately extract the off-grid range and velocity parameters from these sparse pilots, we develop a corresponding high-resolution algorithm based on the weighted unwrapped phase (WUP) technique and the RELAX-based iterative method. Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adopted to prune the redundant detections arising from beam overlap. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in comparison to other techniques.</description>

      <title>Doppler Invariant CNN for Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS achieves 25-{\mu}m spatial and 10-ms temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Automatic Differentiation of Direct Form Digital Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed.

      <title>HyMAD: A Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection Approach for Border Surveillance and Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Beam Broadening for DoA Estimation in Dynamic and Resource-Constrained DFRC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and radio frequency (RF) chains. In this work, we consider a conceptual DFRC scheduler model which shares RF chains between radar and communication functions. If such a scheduler is tuned for prioritizing communication performance, the RF chains and time allocated to radar are less and varying. We propose a practical, low-latency and resource-aware technique for sensing the entire field-of-view (FOV) and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in such settings by leveraging time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing. This results in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better DoA estimation reliability. Extensive simulation studies show that the technique has consistent target detection and angle estimation performance in all directions and adapts to varying resource availability with time.</description>

      <title>Frequency Diverse Array OFDM Transmit System with Partial Overlap in Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A frequency-diverse array (FDA) is an alternative array architecture in which each antenna is preceded by a mixer instead of a phase shifter. The mixers introduce a frequency offset between signals transmitted by each antenna, resulting in a time-varying beam pattern. However, time-dependent beamforming is not desirable for communication or sensing. In this paper, the FDA is combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The proposed beamforming method partitions the OFDM symbol transmitted by all antennas into subcarrier blocks, which carry the same data but are precoded differently. The frequency offset between the antennas is equal to the subcarrier block width. Consequently, each antenna transmits a differently precoded subcarrier block at the center frequency, resulting in overlap and coherent summation of the blocks. Proposed architecture enables fully digital beamforming over a single block while requiring only a single digital-to-analog converter. The system's performance and tradeoffs are investigated in the context of joint communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bistatic ISAC Systems for Low-Altitude Economy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The burgeoning low-altitude economy (LAE) necessitates integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems capable of high-accuracy multi-target localization and velocity estimation under hardware and coverage constraints inherent in conventional ISAC architectures. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a cooperative bistatic ISAC framework within MIMO-OFDM cellular networks, enabling robust sensing services for LAE applications through standardized 5G New Radio (NR) infrastructure. We first develop a low-complexity parameter extraction algorithm employing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition, which exploits the inherent Vandermonde structure in delay-related factor matrices to efficiently recover bistatic ranges, Doppler velocities, and angles-of-arrival (AoA) from multi-dimensional received signal tensors. To resolve data association ambiguity across distributed transmitter-receiver pairs and mitigate erroneous estimates, we further design a robust fusion scheme based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) method, enabling joint 3D position and velocity reconstruction. Comprehensive simulation results validate the framework's superiority in computational efficiency and sensing performance for low-altitude scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sizing Antenna Arrays for Near-field Communication and Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems and their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to ease the design of the large antenna arrays under given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Moreover, when considering a region where the beamfocusing resolution does not exceed a specified threshold, the extent of the region is also shown to scale linearly with the array size. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a functional weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm for downlink beamforming in multiuser continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems where both the base station (BS) and users are equipped with CAPAs. We first present a closed-form expression for the achievable rate in multiuser CAPA systems, based on which the equivalence between maximizing the sum rate and minimizing the sum of weighted mean-squared errors (MSE) is established. We then employ the orthonormal basis expansion to transform the formulated functional optimization problem into a parameter optimization problem. By deriving the first-order optimality conditions of the parameter optimization problem and mapping them back to the functional domain, we obtain the update equations of the proposed functional WMMSE algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms discretization-based baselines in both sum rate and computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.</description>

Abstract: Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.</description>

      <title>Artifacts Are Not Noise: Embodied Resonance and the 70% Signal Loss in Conventional EEG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition but fail at causal reasoning. We argue this is not an engineering limitation but reveals something fundamental about the nature of understanding itself. We propose that causal cognition requires a specific physical architecture: stochastic, coupled oscillators with whole-system coordination. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500 plus trials) from a P300 target recognition task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization and compared it to standard voltage (ERP) and coherence (ITC) metrics. Four findings establish the framework. Phase and voltage are globally independent (r of 0.048) yet strongly trial-coupled (r of 0.590), proving R captures hidden cognitive structure. Voltage precedes phase by 293 ms, revealing sequential computation. Frequency decomposition shows Theta (169 ms), Alpha (286 ms), and Beta (777 ms) cascade. Our metric is distinct from standard ITC (r of 0.155). Then we tested the standard assumption. Conventional artifact rejection removes eye movements, muscle activity, and autonomic signals before analysis. The standard model assumes cognition is neural activity plus noise. We ran the identical analysis with and without rejection. Removing artifacts reduced the trial-level correlation threefold (from 0.590 to 0.195). Target discrimination reversed sign (from positive 0.6 percent to negative 0.4 percent). What we discard as noise is 70 percent of the signal. This falsifies the standard model. Cognition is not isolated neural computation. It is whole-body phase synchronization spanning neural, muscular, and autonomic systems. For AI, the implications are direct: embodied sensorimotor integration is not optional. It is the substrate that makes understanding possible.</description>

Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and noise suppression, and it plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific and engineering applications. As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this express, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared with previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by 23 times.</description>
