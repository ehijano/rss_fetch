      <title>Advancing Equitable AI: Evaluating Cultural Expressiveness in LLMs for Latin American Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often reflect biases from economically advanced regions, marginalizing contexts in economically developing regions like Latin America due to imbalanced datasets. This paper examines AI representations of diverse Latin American contexts, revealing disparities between data from economically advanced and developing regions. We highlight how the dominance of English over Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous languages such as Quechua and Nahuatl perpetuates biases, framing Latin American perspectives through a Western lens. To address this, we introduce a culturally aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts, challenging Eurocentric models. We evaluate six language models on questions testing cultural context awareness, using a novel Cultural Expressiveness metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses. Our findings show that some models better capture Latin American perspectives, while others exhibit significant sentiment misalignment (p &lt; 0.001). Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with our dataset improves its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%, advancing equitable AI development. We advocate for equitable AI by prioritizing datasets that reflect Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and diverse languages, while emphasizing community-centered approaches to amplify marginalized voices.</description>

      <title>Launch-Day Diffusion: Tracking Hacker News Impact on GitHub Stars for AI Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate impact remains challenging. This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>

      <title>Statistics of leaves in growing random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leaves, i.e., vertices of degree one, can play a significant role in graph structure, especially in sparsely connected settings in which leaves often constitute the largest fraction of vertices. We consider a leaf-based counterpart of the degree, namely, the leaf degree -- the number of leaves a vertex is connected to -- and the associated leaf degree distribution, analogous to the degree distribution. We determine the leaf degree distribution of random recursive trees (RRTs) and trees grown via a leaf-based preferential attachment mechanism that we introduce. The RRT leaf degree distribution decays factorially, in contrast with its purely geometric degree distribution. In the one-parameter leaf-based growth model, each new vertex attaches to an existing vertex with rate $\ell$ + a, where $\ell$ is the leaf degree of the existing vertex, and a &gt; 0. The leaf degree distribution has a powerlaw tail when 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and an exponential tail (with algebraic prefactor) for a &gt; 1. The critical case of a = 1 has a leaf degree distribution with stretched exponential tail. We compute a variety of additional characteristics in these models and conjecture asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail exponent in the scale free regime. We highlight several avenues of possible extension for future studies.</description>

      <title>Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations -- testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset. Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval -- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off: optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note about their current limitations in capturing human communication.</description>

      <title>A local eigenvector centrality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenvector centrality is an established measure of global connectivity, from which the importance and influence of nodes can be inferred. We introduce a local eigenvector centrality that incorporates both local and global connectivity. This new measure references prominent eigengaps and combines their associated eigenspectrum, via the Euclidean norm, to detect centrality that reflects the influence of prominent community structures. In contact networks, with clearly defined community structures, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify similar but distinct distributions to eigenvector centrality applied on each community in isolation and PageRank. Discrepancies between the two eigenvector measures highlight nodes and communities that do not conform to their defined local structures, e.g. nodes with more connections outside of their defined community than within it. While reference to PageRank's centrality assessment enables a mitigation strategy for localisation effects inherent in eigenvector-based measures. In networks without clearly defined communities, such as city road networks, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify both locally prominent and globally connected hubs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Graph Transformers Across Diverse Graphs and Tasks via Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level tasks involving small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. Our framework, tested on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges, achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing scalability and efficiency. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data, confirming its capability to pre-train on real-world graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and to generalize effectively across diverse static and dynamic downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Who is the root in a syntactic dependency structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm the hypothesis in the sense that root vertices tend to have high centrality and that vertices of high centrality tend to be roots. The best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</description>

      <title>Characterising Global Platforms: Centralised, Decentralised, Federated, and Grassroots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global digital platforms are software systems designed to serve entire populations, with some already serving billions of people. We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes:
  1. Centralised -- one (the server)
  2. Decentralised -- finite $&gt;1$ (bootstrap nodes)
  3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers)
  4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents)
  Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they all satisfy the same basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol. It thus provides a unifying mathematical approach for the study of global digital platforms, perhaps the most important class of computer systems today.</description>
