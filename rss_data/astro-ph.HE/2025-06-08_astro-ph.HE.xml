      <title>Kinematic Evidence for Bipolar Ejecta Flows in the Galactic SNR W49B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W49B is a unique Galactic supernova remnant with centrally peaked, "bar"-like ejecta distribution, which was once considered evidence for a hypernova origin that resulted in a bipolar ejection of the stellar core. However, chemical abundance measurements contradict this interpretation. Closely connected to the morphology of the ejecta is its velocity distribution, which provides critical details for understanding the explosion mechanism. We report the first-ever observational constraint on the kinematics of the ejecta in W49B using the Resolve microcalorimeter spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). Using XRISM/Resolve, we measured the line-of-sight velocity traced by the Fe He$\alpha$ emission, which is the brightest feature in the Resolve spectrum, to vary by $\pm$300 km s$^{-1}$ with a smooth east-to-west gradient of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ along the major axis. Similar trends in the line-of-sight velocity structure were found for other Fe-group elements Cr and Mn, traced by the He$\alpha$ emission, and also for intermediate-mass elements Si, S, Ar, and Ca, traced by the Ly$\alpha$ emission. The discovery of the east-west gradient in the line-of-sight velocity, together with the absence of a twin-peaked line profile or enhanced broadening in the central region, clearly rejects the equatorially expanding disk model. In contrast, the observed velocity structure suggests bipolar flows reminiscent of a bipolar explosion scenario. An alternative scenario would be a collimation of the ejecta by an elongated cavity sculpted by bipolar stellar winds.</description>

      <title>Repeating Flares, X-ray Outbursts and Delayed Infrared Emission: A Comprehensive Compilation of Optical Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as valuable laboratories for studying dormant black holes. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present TDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and 3 jetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength photometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also study the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band variability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determine the duration, rise time , decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our sample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the TDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes, which is consistent with expectations from main sequence star disruption. Using archival observations, we identify four new potentially repeating TDEs, namely AT 2024pvu, AT 2022exr, AT2021uvz, and AT 2019teq, increasing the number of known repeating events. In both newly identified and previously known cases, the secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examine the IR and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out of the 18 IR events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a potential correlation. Finally, we find that for three subsamples (repeating flares, IR-, and X-ray-emitting events), the spectral classes are unlikely to be randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral characteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale population studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential tools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the LSST.</description>

      <title>A possible origin of the overlapping light curve of eRO-QPE1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are recurrent X-ray eruptions discovered so far in the nuclei of low-mass galaxies. However, despite considerable observational progress, the origin of QPEs remains unclear. A variety of models have been proposed to explain their nature, but a definitive understanding has yet to be reached. Recently, chaotic mixtures of multiple overlapping eruptions with varying amplitudes have been observed in eRO-QPE1 obs1-features not reported in any other known QPE sources. This complex behavior presents a challenge to the existing QPE models. In this paper, we propose that the overlapping features may be the result of gravitational lensing. We analyze the light curve of eRO-QPE1 and compare its features to predictions from gravitational lensing scenarios. We discuss the implications for the trigger mechanism of QPEs in general. We show that the unique overlapping features observed in eRO-QPE1 may be naturally reproduced by gravitational lensing effects, without invoking a different physical origin from other known QPE sources.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization Detection of the Pulsar Wind Nebula in G21.5-0.9 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the X-ray polarization observation of G21.5-0.9, a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in October 2023, with a total livetime of approximately 837 ks. Using different analysis methods, such as a space-integrated study of the entire region of the PWN and a space-resolved polarization map, we detect significant polarization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) at the center of the SNR, with an average polarization degree of ~10% oriented at ~33{\deg} (north through east). No significant energy-dependent variation in polarization is observed across the IXPE band (2-8 keV). The polarization map, corrected for the effect of polarization leakage, reveals a consistent pattern in both degree and angle, with little change across the nebula. Our findings indicate the presence of a highly polarized central torus, suggesting low levels of turbulence at particle acceleration sites. Unlike Vela, but similar to the Crab Nebula, we observe substantial differences between radio and X-ray polarization maps. This suggests a clear separation in energy of the emitting particle populations and hints at an important, yet poorly understood, role of instabilities in the turbulence dynamics of PWNe.</description>

      <title>Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with robust uncertainty quantification and model comparison: Bayesian normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Investigating MAXI J1752$-$457 with NuSTAR in the aftermath of a superburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two NuSTAR observations of the X-ray transient, MAXI J1752$-$457, following a superburst which was observed by MAXI/GSC in November, 2024. NuSTAR follow-up confirmed that MAXI J1752$-$457 is coincident with the previously observed Einstein Probe source, EP240809a. We performed a spectral analysis of the source during both NuSTAR observations, and we confirm that the hard X-ray spectra are consistent with the inclusion of a spherical blackbody component. At about 79 hours after the onset of the superburst, we find a blackbody temperature of $kT_\mathrm{bb}=0.60\pm0.1$ keV and $R_\mathrm{bb}/D_{8}=6.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ km (not including corrections for scattering in the neutron star atmosphere), where $D_{8}$ is the source distance, which is not yet known, in units of 8 kpc. Furthermore, we report a hard X-ray excess which is fit well by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\approx4$, much steeper than those typically seen during accretion onto neutron stars at similar luminosities. We infer that the electron energy distribution in the Comptonizing medium which gives rise to the power law component differs significantly compared to purely accretion-powered neutron star transients even several days after the onset and rapid decay of superbursts. We also performed an energy-resolved timing analysis which showed that the source variability was dominated by red noise in the Comptonization component, suggesting coupling with an accretion disk, rather than being seeded by thermal emission from the neutron star surface.</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $2\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.96}_{-0.72}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.10^{+2.59}_{-0.64}\times 10^{5}$ for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively and agree with the Bayesian estimates hitherto obtained in a previous work. Therefore, the results from frequentist analysis GRB 190114C agrees with Bayesian analysis and presents yet another proof of principles applications of profile likelihood in the search for LIV.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Different Types of Low-Angular-Momentum Accretion Flow Solutions in General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on the astrophysical source and its environment, the accretion flows can exhibit a variety of behaviors and characteristics in accordance with the type of solutions. We study low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto black holes using two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) simulations to find imprints of different types of accretion solutions. Such flows, relevant to X-ray binaries and wind-fed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, often lack sufficient angular momentum to form standard accretion disks. We initialize simulations with semi-analytical transonic solutions defined by specific energy (${\cal E}_0$) and angular momentum ($\lambda_0$), allowing a systematic classification of flow types with: (i) an outer sonic point, (ii) an inner sonic point, and (iii) both, exhibiting shock-like transitions. Only solutions with two sonic points produce hot, thermally driven bipolar jets/outflows with Lorentz factors up to $\gamma\sim2$, despite the absence of magnetic fields. Using a general relativistic radiation transfer calculation, we compute broadband spectra and images at X-ray ($1 \, \rm keV$) from bremsstrahlung emission. Radiative properties depend strongly on the type of accretion solution. Solutions with inner sonic points produce the brightest and most extended X-ray emission, while outer-point solutions produce compact, fainter signals. These multidimensional models are thus essential for predicting radiative signatures and will enable the development of semi-analytical tools for interpreting X-ray binaries and possibly Sgr~A$^*$ in weak magnetic field regimes.</description>

      <title>Detection of multiple X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations in IGR J19294+1816 with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the timing results with Insight-HXMT observations of X-ray binary IGR J19294+1816 during its 2019 Type I outburst at the decline phase shortly following its peak. We analyze the light curves and power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2019 observations and reveal a peak at approximately $\nu_{NS} \sim 80.2$ mHz, corresponding to X-ray pulsations from the neutron star. In addition, a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature is observed at around $\nu_{QPO} \sim 30.2$ mHz from 10-50 keV, with the rms amplitude increasing with energy. Furthermore, we detect two QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 51.1$ mHz and $113.7$ mHz (corresponding to sidebands near $\nu_{NS} \pm \nu_{QPO}$) in 25-50 keV, exhibiting an rms amplitude of around 12$\%$. Wavelet analysis also shows multiple QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 30$ mHz, $50$ mHz and $ 110$ mHz and these QPO features show transient behaviors, the centroid frequencies of $\sim 30$ mHz remain nearly constant for different luminosities. Our research identifies IGR J19294+1816 as the second strong magnetic-field pulsar with significant sideband signals around the spin frequency. We explore various physical origins that could explain the presence of multiple QPOs.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Burst Behaviour with Magnetar Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a wide set of historical magnetar burst observations detected with five different instruments, calibrating these to the energy range of Fermi-GBM observations for consistency. We find a striking correlation between a magnetar's characteristic age and both its typical burst energy and its burst activity level. Arguing that this bursting behaviour also correlates with true age, we interpret it as the result of a reducing high-stress volume of the crust in an aging magnetar: previous giant flares cause relaxation of large regions of its crust and inhibit burst clustering, whilst the reducing burst energy reflects the progressively shallower region of the crust where Hall drift can build stresses effectively, as the field decays through the range $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$. Low-energy bursts from very young magnetars may represent failures of weak regions of the crust that have only recently solidified.</description>

      <title>Multi-Instrument Search for Gamma-Ray Counterpart of X-ray Transients detected by EP/WXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a soft X-ray imager with unprecedentedly large field of view, EP/WXT has detected many (fast) X-ray transients, whose nature is very intriguing. Whether there is gamma-ray counterpart for the X-ray transient provides important implications for its origin. Some of them have been reported to be associated with GRB, however, a systematic study on the gamma-ray emission of these X-ray transients is lacking. In this work, we implemented a comprehensive targeted search for gamma-ray counterparts to 63 X-ray transients reported by EP/WXT during its first year of operation, using the dedicated multiple-instrument search pipeline, ETJASMIN, with GECAM-B, GECAM-C, Fermi/GBM, and \textit{Insight}-HXMT data. We find that 14 out of 63 (22\%) EP/WXT X-ray transients have gamma-ray counterparts. For other transients, ETJASMIN pipeline provided upper limit of gamma-ray emission, which is more stringent than that given by individual instrument. Moreover, we investigated the properties of the X-ray transients and their gamma-ray counterparts, and explored the relation between the x-ray transient and gamma-ray counterpart.</description>

      <title>Convection Anisotropies of Cosmic Rays in Highly Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Zhang &amp; Liu (2024) proposed a turbulent convection model for multiscale anisotropies of cosmic rays (CRs), with an assumption of isotropic diffusion such that the anisotropies are statistically isotropic. However, this assumption may be unrealistic for TeV CRs, whose observations have revealed the significance of the local interstellar background magnetic field. To meet the difficulty, the turbulent convection scenario needs to be extended to cover anisotropic diffusion. In this paper, we focus on the parallel diffusion with isotropic pitch-angle scattering, which may be an approximation to the transport process driven by weak hydromagnetic waves in a magnetic flux tube, where fluctuations of the wave velocities lead to the turbulent convection. The consequence is the breaking of the statistical isotropy, while the overall shape of the angular power spectrum, $ \overline{C_\ell}\propto\ell ^{-\gamma -1} $ ($ \ell\gg 1 $), remains similar to that in the isotropic diffusion model, where $ \ell $ are degrees of spherical harmonics, and $ \gamma $ is the turbulence spectral index of the convection field. It is then expected that the power-law index of the TeV CR small-scale angular power spectrum can be explained with the Kolmogorov law $ \gamma =5/3 $, irrespective of the background magnetic field to some extent.</description>

      <title>Exploration of features in the black hole mass spectrum inspired by non-parametric analyses of gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave data reveal structures in the mass function of binary compact objects. Properly modelling and deciphering such structures is the ultimate goal of gravitational-wave population analysis: in this context, non-parametric models are a powerful tool to infer the distribution of black holes from gravitational waves without committing to any specific functional form. Here, we aim to quantitatively corroborate the findings of non-parametric methods with parametrised models incorporating the features found in such analyses. We propose two modifications of the currently favoured PowerLaw+Peak model, inspired by non-parametric studies, and use them to analyse the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Our analysis marginally supports the existence of two distinct, differently redshift-evolving subpopulations in the black hole primary mass function, and suggests that, to date, we are still unable to robustly assess the shape of the mass ratio distribution for symmetric ($q&gt;0.7$) binaries.</description>

      <title>ALMA polarimetry of radio-quiet AGNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below $\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows, while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of 0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2; however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the total flux variability.</description>

      <title>Impact of model parameter degeneracy on leptonic radiation models. The case of blazar multi-wavelength spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptonic one-zone radiation models are commonly used to describe multi-wavelength data and explore the physical properties of high-energy sources, such as active galactic nuclei. However, these models often require a large number of free parameters. In the context of possible parameter degeneracy and the complex landscape of the parameter space, we study how the choice of the fitting procedure impacts the characterization of the source properties. Furthermore, we examine how the data coverage and the uncertainties associated to the data influence the model parameter degeneracy. We generated simulated spectral energy distribution datasets with different properties, which we then fit with a numerical model. The model describes the relevant radiation processes with seven free parameters. We compare different optimization algorithms and study the parameter degeneracy using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Additionally, we applied the same fitting procedures to the observational data of two sources, Mrk 501 and PKS 0735+178. We demonstrate significant degeneracies in the seven-dimensional parameter space of the one-zone leptonic models caused by the incomplete wavelength coverage of the data. Given the same goodness-of-fit function, the best-fit result depends on the choice of the minimization algorithm. Source properties extracted from the best-fit solution to realistic datasets cannot be interpreted as the only solution due to significant degeneracies of the model parameters. Adding new energy ranges (e.g. MeV) and regular source monitoring would allow to reduce gaps in the data and significantly decrease the parameter degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster count cosmology with simulation-based inference</title>

Abstract: The abundance and mass distribution of galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe of cosmological parameters, through the sensitivity of the high-mass end of the halo mass function to $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. While galaxy cluster surveys have been used as cosmological probes for more than a decade, the accuracy of cluster count experiments is still hampered by systematic, such as the relation between observables and halo mass, the accuracy of the halo mass function, and the survey selection function. Here we show that these uncertainties can be alleviated by forward modeling the observed cluster population with simulation-based inference. We construct a pipeline that predicts the distribution of observables from cosmological parameters and scaling relations, and then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the input parameters and the measured distributions. We focus on fiducial X-ray surveys with available flux, temperature, and redshift measurements, although the method can be easily adapted to any available observable. We apply our method to mock samples extracted from the UNIT1i simulation and demonstrate the accuracy of our approach. We then study the impact of several systematic uncertainties on the recovered cosmological parameters. We show that sample variance and the choice of the halo mass function are subdominant sources of uncertainty. Conversely, the absolute mass scale is the leading source of systematic error and must be calibrated at the $&lt;10\%$ level to recover accurate values of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. However, the quantity $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.3}$ appears to be less sensitive to the accuracy of the mass calibration. We conclude that simulation-based inference is a promising avenue for future cosmological studies from galaxy cluster surveys such as eROSITA and Euclid as it allows to consider all the available observables in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of the Landau Parameter $G'_0$ from Joint Gamow-Teller Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Migdal parameter $G'_0$ characterizes the main part of the spin-isospin nucleon-nucleon interaction. Consequently, the $G'_0$ is closely related to the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR), the beta and double-beta decay rates of finite nuclei, the spin response of hot and dense nucleonic matter that determines the neutrino-nucleon reaction rates in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, and finally the critical density for pion condensation in neutron stars. Historically, the $G'_0$ was obtained by fitting the peak location of experimental GTR spectra by using phenomenological pion exchange models, without strict uncertainty quantification. In this letter, for the first time, we report the Bayesian inference of $G'_0$ by using a self-consistent Skyrme Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) model and joint constraints from experimental GTR measurements on $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$, $^{132}\mathrm{Sn}$, $^{90}\mathrm{Zr}$. Our extracted $G_0'$ is $0.48\pm0.034$, which is close to the prediction of a few existing Skyrme models that consider the spin-isospin observables but is smaller than the extracted ones from pion-exchange models. We hint to possible reasons for this deviation, like the value of the nucleon effective mass $\frac{m^*}{m}$. Finally, we demonstrate the influence of $G'_0$ on neutrino opacities in CCSNe and BNS mergers. The new Skyrme parameterizations from our Bayesian study may also be used to study other spin-isospin-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron star crust properties using an ab initio-benchmarked meta-model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the neutron star crust is essential for interpreting multimessenger observations and constraining the nuclear equation of state (EoS). However, standard phenomenological EoS models often rely on heuristic extrapolations in the low-density regime, which are inconsistent with microscopic predictions. In this work, we refine a unified meta-modeling framework for the EoS by incorporating low-density corrections based on energy density functionals constrained by ab initio neutron-matter calculations. Using Bayesian inference to combine information from astrophysical observations, nuclear theory, and experiments, we assess the impact of these corrections on key crustal properties, including the crust-core transition density and pressure, crustal composition, and moment of inertia. The improved model reduces uncertainties in the inner crust and emphasizes the importance of low-density physics in EoS modeling, highlighting the value of integrating both theoretical and observational constraints across densities to robustly describe the EoS. Moreover, the adopted approach can be readily applied to any existing EoS model to provide a solid framework for interpreting upcoming high-precision multimessenger data.</description>

      <title>The polarization of strongly lensed point-like radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. The magnetized medium induces birefringence, splitting the light into two distinct wave modes. The differing propagation speeds of the two modes result in different trajectories. Strong gravitational lensing amplifies the birefringence and introduces an additional geometric rotation on top of the Faraday rotation. We compare the geometric rotation with the Faraday rotation. Methods. We construct the lens equation for massive objects in a magnetized plasma environment, and calculate the time delay difference between the two modes using two toy examples. We present that in the strong lensed radio sources, birefringence causes geometric rotation, which is a non-negligible effect, even with a weak magnetic field. Results. In both examples, the geometric delay causes a comparable or stronger rotation than the Faraday rotation and show a similar dependence on the wavelength of the signal. For a point lens with a strong magnetic field, the two wave modes exhibit distinct behaviours. The polarization of lensed sources can provide additional insights into the magnetic field and plasma environment.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the light bending phenomenon for a pulsar in a binary with a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of light-bending on the signal of a pulsar in binaries with rotating black hole companions, focusing on stellar mass black holes. We show that the impacts of various parameters on the bending delays visually match with those observed for a non-rotating black holes, because the magnitude of the spin as well as the orientation of the spin axis of the black hole introduce changes in the nanosecond order and other parameters do so in the microsecond order. Consequently, the distortion of the beam and the resulting changes in the pulse shape are minimally influenced by spin-related parameters of the black hole. We also investigate the impact of various parameters on the difference of the delays with and without the spin of the black hole and notice nanosecond scale discontinuities at orbital phases where the path of the light ray changes its direction with respect to the direction of the spin of the black hole. Moreover, as in the Schwarzschild case, the bending delays become irregular (on the microsecond scale) near the superior conjunction. We also explore the effect of bending on the pulse profiles and bending delays if the companion of the pulsar is a rotating super-massive black hole. We find significant enhancement and change in the shape of the profiles at and near the superior conjunction in comparison to stellar mass black holes. Moreover, bending delays are about three orders of magnitude higher than those in case of the stellar mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting II -- High-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray Integral Field Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray spectral fitting in high-energy astrophysics can be reliably accelerated using Machine Learning. In particular, Simulation-based Inference (SBI) produces accurate posterior distributions in the Gaussian and Poisson regime for low-resolution spectra, much faster than other exact approaches such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains or Nested Sampling. We now aim to highlight the capabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels encourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking advantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression schemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the counts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the efficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various spectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion models and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful summary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full spectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact computation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to the good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations, hence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many observations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted for using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a robust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows great promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the scientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current era of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with real data.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric representations of the high-density nuclear equation of state are used in constructing models for interpreting the astrophysical observations of neutron stars. This study explores how accurately equations of state with strong first-order phase transitions can be represented using spectral or piecewise analytic methods that assume no {\it{a priori}} knowledge of the location or the strength of the phase transition. The model equations of state used in this study have phase transitions strong enough to induce a gravitational instability that terminates the sequence of stable neutron stars. These equations of state also admit a second sequence of stable stars with core matter that has undergone this strong first-order phase transition (possibly driven by quark deconfinement). These results indicate that spectral representations generally achieve somewhat higher accuracy than piecewise analytic representations having the same number of parameters. Both types of representation show power-law convergence at approximately the same rate.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are subject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks</title>

Abstract: Single-frequency emission from an accretion disk around a black hole is broadened into a line profile due to gravitational redshift and the motion of the disk's particles relative to the observer. The ensemble of relativistically broadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed by an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting systems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's inclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These inferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk consists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we revisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We provide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological features, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations of the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however, are model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical assumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to deviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic features of the line profile under the Standard disk model. Our results further demonstrate how sensitive our understanding of black hole and system properties can be to assumptions we make when interpreting these types of measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing the PeV Region in the Astrophysical Neutrino Spectrum using $\nu_\mu$ from the Southern Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IceCube has observed a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over the energy region from a few TeV to a few PeV. At PeV energies, the spectral shape is not yet well measured due to the low statistics of the data. This analysis probes the gap between 1 PeV and 10 PeV by using high-energy downgoing muon neutrinos. To reject the large atmospheric muon background, two complementary techniques are combined. The first technique selects events with high stochasticity to reject atmospheric muon bundles whose stochastic energy losses are smoothed due to high muon multiplicity. The second technique vetoes atmospheric muons with the IceTop surface array. Using 9 years of data, we found two neutrino candidate events in the signal region, consistent with expectation from background, each with relatively high signal probabilities. A joint maximum likelihood estimation is performed using this sample and an independent 9.5-year sample of tracks to measure the neutrino spectrum. A likelihood ratio test is done to compare the single power-law (SPL) vs. SPL+cutoff hypothesis; the SPL+cutoff model is not significantly better than the SPL. High-energy astrophysical objects from four source catalogs are also checked around the direction of the two events. No significant coincidence was found.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recent Physical Review Letter [1] which presents a new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>
