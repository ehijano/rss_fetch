      <title>Semantic-Aware Edge Intelligence for UAV Handover in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal, the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios, demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of approximately 0.9 for reason tags.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</description>

      <title>Rebuild AC Power Flow Models with Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analyses for Continuous-time Linear Systems: System Identification and Online Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real world evolves in continuous time but computations are done from finite samples. Therefore, we study algorithms using finite observations in continuous-time linear dynamical systems. We first study the system identification problem, and propose a first non-asymptotic error analysis with finite observations. Our algorithm identifies system parameters without needing integrated observations over certain time intervals, making it more practical for real-world applications. Further we propose a lower bound result that shows our estimator is provably optimal up to constant factors. Moreover, we apply the above algorithm to online control regret analysis for continuous-time linear system. Our system identification method allows us to explore more efficiently, enabling the swift detection of ineffective policies. We achieve a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ over a single $T$-time horizon in a controllable system, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(T)$ observations of the system.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Security Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow Using General Polynomial Chaos Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.</description>

      <title>Incorporating flexibility and resilience demand into capacity market considering the guidance on generation investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity market provides economic guidance for generation investment and ensures the adequacy of generation capability for power systems. With the rapidly increasing proportion of renewable energy, the adequacy of flexibility and resilience becomes more crucial for the secure operation of power systems. In this context, this paper incorporates the flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market by formulating the capacity demand curves for ramping capability, inertia and recovery capabilities besides the generation capability. The guidance on generation investment of the capacity market is also taken into account by solving the generation investment equilibrium among generation companies with a Nash Cournot model employing an equivalent quadratic programming formulation. The overall problem is established as a trilevel game and an iterative algorithm is devised to formulate the capacity demand curves in the upper level based on Genco's investment acquired from the middle and lower levels. The case study further demonstrates that to incorporate flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market could stimulate proper generation investment and ensure the adequacy of flexibility and resilience in power systems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Antenna Devices through Interval Arithmetic -- A Generalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for the sensitivity analysis of electromagnetic (EM) systems whose transfer function (TF), that is the input-output (I/O) relationship between the input parameters affected by tolerance and the system response (i.e., the arising EM performance of interest), is not available in closed (or explicit) form. The method is a generalized analytic technique based on the Interval Analysis (IA). First, an analytic surrogate model (SM) of the TF is defined by means of a learning-by-example (LBE) approach starting from a set of available I/O examples. Then, the LBE-derived SM is extended to intervals through IA to yield inclusive, yet finite, performance bounds of the output system response when the control parameters are affected by unknown, but bounded, tolerances. A set of representative numerical examples is reported to validate the proposed IA-LBE method as well as to assess its effectiveness and reliability when dealing with realistic EM systems (e.g., antennas) for which the TF is not explicitly known.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC) is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.</description>

      <title>Communication-aware Wide-Area Damping Control using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or {cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Charger Infrastructure Planning: Demand Estimation, Coverage Optimization Over an Integrated Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For electrifying the transportation sector, deploying a strategically planned and efficient charging infrastructure is essential. This paper presents a two-phase approach for electric vehicle (EV) charger deployment that integrates spatial point-of-interest analysis and maximum coverage optimization over an integrated spatial power grid. Spatial-focused studies in the literature often overlook electrical grid constraints, while grid-focused work frequently considers statistically modeled EV charging demand. To address these gaps, a new framework is proposed that combines spatial network planning with electrical grid considerations. This study approaches EV charger planning from a perspective of the distribution grid, starting with an estimation of EV charging demand and the identification of optimal candidate locations. It ensures that the capacity limits of newly established chargers are maintained within the limits of the power grid. This framework is applied in a test case for the Dallas area, integrating the existing EV charger network with an 8500-bus distribution system for comprehensive planning.</description>

      <title>Real Time Fatigue Crack Growth Monitoring Using High Precision Control and Data Acquisition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue cracks may initiate and propagate long before a structural component reaches the end of its nominal life. Detecting and quantifying crack growth in real time is critical for avoiding catastrophic failures in aerospace structures, nuclear reactors and civil infrastructure. This research reviews four widely used crack growth monitoring techniques: digital image correlation (DIC), acoustic emission (AE), compliance based methods and direct current potential drop (DCPD). The research evaluates their working principles, instrumentation, detection thresholds, noise sensitivities and suitability under various environmental conditions. Recent advances in high precision control and data acquisition systems (DAQs) that enable multi sensor data fusion are explored. The goal is to guide selection and integration of monitoring methods in modern structural health monitoring architectures.</description>

      <title>Toward a Robust Biomimetic Hybrid Battery: Bridging Biology, Electrochemistry and Data-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles and renewable energy systems need batteries that charge quickly, last many years and still store a lot of energy, but current chemistries struggle to deliver all three. Inspired by electric fish that deliver bursts of current and birds that sleep with half their brains, we propose a hybrid battery concept called SwiftPulse. It combines sodium-ion cells that provide energy with niobium-oxide cells that accept high-power pulses. A pulse-based charger and a battery-management strategy rotate clusters of cells into rest so they can recover. We derive simple models of energy density, diffusion and capacity fade to show that a pack made mostly of sodium-ion modules with a smaller fraction of niobium-oxide modules could exceed 175 Wh per kg, endure more than ten thousand charge-discharge cycles and recharge to eighty percent in less than ten minutes. Simulations suggest that pulsed charging reduces ion buildup at the surface and slows degradation. We outline a roadmap for cell-level and module-level experiments and suggest integrating machine learning to adapt pulse parameters and rest scheduling. By blending ideas from biology, electrochemistry and data-driven control, this work points toward batteries that are safer, faster to charge and longer lasting.</description>

      <title>Equation-Free Coarse Control of Distributed Parameter Systems via Local Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum, yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.</description>

      <title>Frequency Control and Optimal Power Sharing in Combined Power and Heating Networks with Heat Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat pumps have the capability for fast adjustments in power consumption with potential connections to large heating-inertia district heating networks, and are thus a very important resource for providing frequency support in low-inertia power systems. Nevertheless, the coupling of power networks with district heating systems renders the underlying dynamics much more involved. It is therefore important to ensure that system stability and appropriate power sharing are maintained. In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging district heating systems as ancillary services for primary frequency control in power networks via heat pumps. We propose a novel power sharing scheme for heating systems based on the average temperature. This enables an optimal power allocation among diverse energy sources without requiring load disturbances information. We then discuss two approaches for heating systems to contribute to frequency regulation in power networks. We show that both approaches ensure stability in the combined heat and power network and facilitate optimal power allocation among the different energy sources. We also discuss how various generation dynamics can be incorporated into our framework with guaranteed stability and optimality. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate various tradeoffs in the transient response and the practical potential of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Solar and Wind Power Forecasting: A Comparative Review of LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising global energy demand from population growth raises concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels. Consequently, the energy sector has increasingly transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are naturally abundant. However, the periodic and unpredictable nature of these resources pose significant challenges for power system reliability. Accurate forecasting is essential to ensure grid stability and optimize energy management. But due to the high variability in weather conditions which directly affected wind and solar energy, achieving precise predictions remains difficult. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), offer promising solutions to improve forecasting accuracy. The study highlights three widely used algorithms for solar and wind energy prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are capable of learning complex patterns from historical and environmental data, enabling more accurate forecasts and contributing to the enhanced efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. This review aims to provide an overview on RF, XGBoost, and LSTM by conducting a comparative analysis across three essential criteria: research prevalence, model complexity, and computational execution time.</description>

      <title>SDC-Based Model Predictive Control: Enhancing Computational Feasibility for Safety-Critical Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is widely used for controlling high-speed robotic systems such as quadrotors. However, its significant computational demands often hinder real-time feasibility and reliability, particularly in environments requiring robust obstacle avoidance. This paper proposes a novel SDC-Based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which preserves the high-precision performance of NMPC while substantially reducing computational complexity by over 30%. By reformulating the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics through the State-Dependent Coefficient (SDC) method, the original nonlinear program problem is transformed into a sequential quadratic optimization problem. The controller integrates an integral action to eliminate steady-state tracking errors and imposes constraints for safety-critical obstacle avoidance. Additionally, a disturbance estimator is incorporated to enhance robustness against external perturbations. Simulation results demonstrate that the SDC-Based MPC achieves comparable tracking accuracy to NMPC, with greater efficiency in terms of computation times, thereby improving its suitability for real-time applications. Theoretical analysis further establishes the stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Small-Covariance Noise-to-State Stability of Stochastic Systems and Its Applications to Stochastic Gradient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies gradient dynamics subject to additive random noise, which may arise from sources such as stochastic gradient estimation, measurement noise, or stochastic sampling errors. To analyze the robustness of such stochastic gradient systems, the concept of small-covariance noise-to-state stability (NSS) is introduced, along with a Lyapunov-based characterization. Furthermore, the classical Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on the objective function is generalized to the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition via comparison functions, thereby extending its applicability to a broader class of optimization problems. It is shown that the stochastic gradient dynamics exhibit small-covariance NSS if the objective function satisfies the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition and possesses a globally Lipschitz continuous gradient. This result implies that the trajectories of stochastic gradient dynamics converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with high probability, with the size of the neighborhood determined by the noise covariance. Moreover, if the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition is strengthened to a $\mathcal{K}_\infty$-PL condition, the dynamics are NSS; whereas if it is weakened to a general positive-definite-PL condition, the dynamics exhibit integral NSS. The results further extend to objectives without globally Lipschitz gradients through appropriate step-size tuning. The proposed framework is further applied to the robustness analysis of policy optimization for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and logistic regression.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Detection and Coverage of Unknown Target Areas by Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel coverage control algorithm for multi-agent systems, where each agent has no prior knowledge of the specific region to be covered. The proposed method enables agents to autonomously detect the target area and collaboratively achieve full coverage. Once an agent detects a part of the target region within its sensor range, a dynamically constructed density function is generated to attract nearby agents. By integrating this density-driven mechanism with Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), the agents are guided to achieve optimal spatial distribution. Additionally, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed to ensure collision avoidance and maintain non-overlapping sensor coverage, enhancing both safety and efficiency. Simulation results verify that agents can independently locate and effectively cover the target area.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Dynamic Consensus in Multi-Agent Systems: A Q-Function Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for achieving dynamic consensus in linear discrete-time homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with marginally stable or unstable dynamics. The guarantee of consensus in this setting involves a set of constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation. Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness, and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing some existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Position estimation based on UWB swarm optimization and comparison against traditional trilateration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a promising technology for indoor position estimation for various localization applications of object swarms, such as in 3D analysis of human movement with multiple on-body sensors or a swarm of drones in an indoor environment. However, most UWB-only position estimation methods are based on a star topology, where the position of a mobile node is estimated using distances from several fixed anchors. These approaches ignore the valuable inter-node distance estimates, possible in a fully-connected 'Swarm' topology, which could provide more redundancy in the set of available distance estimates used for the position estimation. This would improve the accuracy and consistency of the position estimates. Also, published studies do not analyze how input measurement errors affect the final position estimates, which makes it difficult to assess the reliability under varying conditions. Therefore, this study first proposes a UWB swarm optimization-based position estimation method that utilizes all available internode distances to enhance accuracy and compare against the traditional trilateration method that utilizes the star configuration. All validations were done with synthetic UWB data, to enable testing all input error situations. The comprehensive error sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate its robustness under varying noise conditions. The proposed method consistently outperformed trilateration, with position estimation error around 5.7 cm for realistic UWB distance input estimates, while for higher noise conditions, the proposed method had errors around 6 cm lower than the trilateration method, which had position estimation errors around 19 cm. This study demonstrates the general potential of the Swarm optimization-based method for position estimation as a more accurate and consistent alternative to traditional star-based trilateration methods.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Control via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization: A Rollout Approach with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a controller design method aiming to balance control performance and actuation frequency. In this framework, actuation timings are determined in an event-driven manner, resulting in intermittent control actions. Control performance is measured by an infinite-horizon average cost, and input sparsity is promoted through actuation-rate regularization. Since the formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a rollout algorithm to find a suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, the event-triggering condition is derived through a multistage minimization procedure using a receding-horizon approach. We establish theoretical performance bounds with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Coordinated vs. Sequential Transmission Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated planning of generation, storage, and transmission more accurately captures the interactions among these three capacity types necessary to meet electricity demand, at least in theory. However, in practice, U.S. system operators typically follow a sequential planning approach: They first determine future generation and storage additions based on an assumed unconstrained (`copper plate') system. Next, they perform dispatch simulations of this projected generation and storage capacity mix on the existing transmission grid to identify transmission constraint violations. These violations indicate the need for transmission upgrades. We describe a multistage, multi-locational planning model that co-optimizes generation, storage, and transmission investments. The model respects reliability constraints as well as state energy and climate policies. We test the two planning approaches using a current stakeholder-informed 20-zone model of the PJM region, developed for the current FERC Order No. 1920 compliance filing process. In our most conservative model specification, we find that the co-optimized approach estimates 67% lower transmission upgrade needs than the sequential model, leading to total system costs that are .6% lower and similar reliability and climate outcomes. Our sensitivities show larger transmission and cost savings and reliability and climate benefits from co-optimized planning.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow Learning Theory: Finite-Sample Guarantees for Vector-Field Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the identification of continuous-time vector fields from irregularly sampled trajectories. We introduce Spectral Flow Learning (SFL), which learns in a windowed flow space using a lag-linear label operator that aggregates lagged Koopman actions. We provide finite-sample high-probability (FS-HP) guarantees for the class of variable-step linear multistep methods (vLLM). The FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory.
  This preliminary preprint states the results and sketches proofs, with full proofs and extensions deferred to a journal version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper details the implementation and experimental validation of a real-time control system for a three-phase induction motor using the Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D microcontroller. The system integrates pulse-width modulation (PWM) generation, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and quadrature encoder feedback to facilitate precise control under various strategies. A current sensing solution based on the AMC1301 isolation amplifier and shunt resistor ensures accurate and safe current measurement for feedback loops. Two control algorithms, V/f and Field-Oriented Control (FOC) are implemented and tested. Real-time parameter tuning and data visualization are achieved using GUI Composer, enabling efficient system debugging and interaction. Experimental results demonstrate smooth speed reversal, fast dynamic response, and stable performance under both step and multi-step inputs. While GUI Composer effectively supports general monitoring and control, limitations in signal bandwidth are noted compared to professional-grade platforms. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the implemented control strategies for high-performance induction motor applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Estimation of Equivalent Series Resistance for Predicting Output Capacitor Failures in Boost Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Output capacitors are among the most critical components in power electronic converters, as their degradation directly affects system stability and reliability. A key indicator of capacitor health is the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), whose progressive increase is strongly correlated with aging and imminent failure. This paper presents a real-time technique for estimating the ESR of output capacitors in boost converters, with the aim of enabling early fault prediction and condition-based maintenance. The proposed method leverages online parameter estimation to extract ESR values without interrupting converter operation. The estimation algorithm has been implemented on a low-cost STM32 Nucleo platform, demonstrating both computational efficiency and suitability for embedded applications. Experimental validation confirms that the approach provides accurate ESR tracking under varying load and operating conditions, allowing timely detection of abnormal capacitor behavior and preventing unexpected system failures.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Input-Constrained Nonlinear Intercept Guidance in Multiple Engagement Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for assessing the attack resilience of linear time-invariant systems against malicious false data injection sensor attacks. Based on the concept of sparse observability, data-driven resilience metrics are proposed. First, we derive a data-driven necessary and sufficient condition for assessing the system's resilience against sensor attacks, using data collected without any attacks. If we obtain attack-free data that satisfy a specific rank condition, we can exactly evaluate the attack resilience level even in a model-free setting. We then extend this analysis to a scenario where only poisoned data are available. Given the poisoned data, we can only conservatively assess the system's resilience. In both scenarios, we also provide polynomial-time algorithms to assess the system resilience under specific conditions. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Optimal Power Flow: A Behavioral Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing decentralization of power systems driven by a large number of renewable energy sources poses challenges in power flow optimization. Partially unknown power line properties can render model-based approaches unsuitable. With increasing deployment of sensors, data-driven methods rise as a promising alternative. They offer the flexibility to adapt to varying grid structures and unknown line properties. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven representation of nonlinear power flow equations for radial grids based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma. The approach allows for direct integration of input/output data into power flow optimisation, enabling cost minimization and constraint enforcement without requiring explicit knowledge of the electrical properties or the topology of the grid. Moreover, we formulate a convex relaxation to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. In a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the novel approach performs similar to state-of-the-art methods, without the need for an explicit system identification step.</description>

      <title>Trust and Transparency in AI: Industry Voices on Data, Ethics, and Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act directs businesses to assess their AI systems to ensure they are developed in a way that is human-centered and trustworthy. The rapid adoption of AI in the industry has outpaced ethical evaluation frameworks, leading to significant challenges in accountability, governance, data quality, human oversight, technological robustness, and environmental and societal impacts. Through structured interviews with fifteen industry professionals, paired with a literature review conducted on each of the key interview findings, this paper investigates practical approaches and challenges in the development and assessment of Trustworthy AI (TAI). The findings from participants in our study, and the subsequent literature reviews, reveal complications in risk management, compliance and accountability, which are exacerbated by a lack of transparency, unclear regulatory requirements and a rushed implementation of AI. Participants reported concerns that technological robustness and safety could be compromised by model inaccuracies, security vulnerabilities, and an overreliance on AI without proper safeguards in place. Additionally, the negative environmental and societal impacts of AI, including high energy consumption, political radicalisation, loss of culture and reinforcement of social inequalities, are areas of concern. There is a pressing need not just for risk mitigation and TAI evaluation within AI systems but for a wider approach to developing an AI landscape that aligns with the social and cultural values of the countries adopting those technologies.</description>

      <title>Red Teaming Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Standards: A Penetration Testing Framework Integrating AI and Quantum Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Orbit Servicing and Active Debris Removal require advanced robotic capabilities for capturing and detumbling uncooperative targets. This work presents a hierarchical control framework for autonomous robotic capture of tumbling objects in space. A simulation environment is developed, incorporating sloshing dynamics of the chaser, a rarely studied effect in space robotics. The proposed controller combines an inner Lyapunov-based robust control loop for multi-body dynamics with an outer loop addressing an extended inverse kinematics problem. Simulation results show improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing control schemes.</description>

      <title>Safe Task Space Synchronization with Time-Delayed Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Physically Plausible Multi-System Trajectory Generation and Symmetry Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</description>

      <title>MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</description>

      <title>Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies. Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.</description>

We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.</description>

      <title>Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU) multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS) performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Efficient Norm-Based Reachable Sets via Iterative Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical optimal control framework for reachable set computation using \emph{normotopes}, a new set representation as a norm ball with a shaping matrix. In reachable set computations, we expect to continuously vary the shape matrix as a function of time. Incorporating the shape dynamics as an input, we build a \emph{controlled embedding system} using a linear differential inclusion overapproximating the dynamics of the system, where a single forward simulation of this embedding system always provides an overapproximating reachable set of the system, no matter the choice of \emph{hypercontrol}. By iteratively solving a linear quadratic approximation of the nonlinear optimal hypercontrol problem, we synthesize less conservative final reachable sets, providing a natural tradeoff between runtime and accuracy. Terminating our algorithm at any point always returns a valid reachable set overapproximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our results with experiments.</description>

Abstract: This article shows that distributionally robust controller synthesis as investigated in \cite{taskesen2024distributionally} can be formulated as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) synthesis problem. To this end, we rely on well-established convexification techniques from robust control. The LMI synthesis problem we propose has the advantage that it can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf semi-definite programming (SDP) solvers. In addition, our formulation exposes the studied distributionally robust controller synthesis problem as an instance of robust $H_2$ synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling how networks change under structural perturbations can yield foundational insights into network robustness, which is critical in many real-world applications. The largest connected component is a popular measure of network performance. Percolation theory provides a theoretical framework to establish statistical properties of the largest connected component of large random graphs. However, this theoretical framework is typically only exact in the large-$\nodes$ limit, failing to capture the statistical properties of largest connected components in small networks, which many real-world networks are. We derive expected values for the largest connected component of small $G(\nodes,p)$ random graphs from which nodes are either removed uniformly at random or targeted by highest degree and compare these values with existing theory. We also visualize the performance of our expected values compared to existing theory for predicting the largest connected component of various real-world, small graphs.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Control for Energy-Efficient UAV Swarms: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Constrained Optimization from a Control Perspective via Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing safe derivative-free optimization algorithms under unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge in modern learning and control. Most existing zeroth-order (ZO) approaches typically assume white-box constraints or focus on convex settings, leaving the general case of nonconvex optimization with black-box constraints largely open. We propose a control-theoretic framework for ZO constrained optimization that enforces feasibility without relying on solving costly convex subproblems. Leveraging feedback linearization, we introduce a family of ZO feedback linearization (ZOFL) algorithms applicable to both equality and inequality constraints. Our method requires only noisy, sample-based gradient estimates yet provably guarantees constraint satisfaction under mild regularity conditions. We establish finite-time bounds on constraint violation and further present a midpoint discretization variant that further improves feasibility without sacrificing optimality. Empirical results demonstrate that ZOFL consistently outperforms standard ZO baselines, achieving competitive objective values while maintaining feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of identifying state-dependent switching systems, a class of hybrid dynamical systems that combine multiple linear or nonlinear modes. We propose two broad classes of switching systems: switching linear systems (SLSs) and switching polynomial systems (SPSs). We first formulate the joint estimation of the mode dynamics and switching rules as a mixed integer program. To solve its inherent scalability issue, we develop a hierarchy of convex relaxations and establish a bound and conditions under which these relaxations are tight. Building on these results, we propose a bilevel convex optimization framework that alternates between mode assignment and dynamics estimation, and we recover switching boundaries using margin-based polynomial classifiers. Numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear oscillators demonstrate that the method accurately identifies mode dynamics and reconstructs switching surfaces from trajectory data. Our results provide a tractable optimization-based framework for switching system identification.</description>

      <title>Towards Tighter Convex Relaxation of Mixed-integer Programs: Leveraging Logic Network Flow for Task and Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework, named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing environmental conditions.

      <description>arXiv:2509.24524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid, sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Humanoid Robot Trajectory Generation via Physics-Informed Learning and Control-Informed Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</description>

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation due to data dependence.</description>

      <title>Path Diffuser: Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Traffic Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories. Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably, Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from adversarial benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</description>

      <title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03231v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</description>

      <title>Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hierarchical AoII over Unreliable Channels: A Stochastic Hybrid System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHSs) analysis of traditional AoI to the AoII metric. Hierarchical ageing processes are adopted using the continuous AoII for the first time, where two different hierarchy schemes, i.e., a hybrid of linear ageing processes with different slopes and a hybrid of linear and quadratic ageing processes, are considered. We first modify the main result in \cite[Theorem 1]{yates_age_2020b} to provide a systematic way to analyze the continuous hierarchical AoII over unslotted real-time systems. The closed-form expressions of average hierarchical AoII are obtained based on our Theorem \ref{theorem1} in two typical scenarios with different channel conditions, i.e., an M/M/1/1 queue over noisy channels and two M/M/1/1 queues over collision channels. Moreover, we analyze the stability conditions for two scenarios given that the quadratic ageing process may lead to the absence of stationary solutions. Finally, we compare the average age performance between the classic AoI results and our AoII results in the M/M/1/1 queue, and the effects of different channel parameters on AoII are also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 20% and a 40% HDVs nearly halves it, up until 100% HDVs where it drops by nearly 60%. The study also develops an adaptive potential line (APL) controller that forms APL corridors in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of nearly 10% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs is required to start observing the major LFT benefits. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</description>

      <title>FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

      <title>A Model-Free Terminal Iterative Learning Control Scheme for Multi-Layer Printing Alignment Control Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technologies are promising for high-volume continuous production of substrate-based electronic products. One of the major challenges in R2R flexible electronics printing is achieving tight alignment tolerances, as specified by the device resolution (usually at the micro-meter level), for multi-layer printed electronics. The alignment of the printed patterns in different layers is known as registration. Conventional registration control methods rely on real-time feedback controllers, such as PID control, to regulate the web tension and the web speed. However, those methods may lose effectiveness in compensating for recurring disturbances and supporting effective mitigation of registration errors. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning Control (STILC) method integrated with PID control to iteratively learn and reduce registration error cycle-by-cycle, converging it to zero. This approach enables unprecedented precision in the creation, integration, and manipulation of multi-layer microstructures in R2R processes. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed STILC-PID hybrid approach and validate its effectiveness through a simulated registration error scenario caused by axis mismatch between roller and motor, a common issue in R2R systems. The results demonstrate that the STILC-PID hybrid control method can fully eliminate the registration error after a feasible number of iterations. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different learning gains on the convergence performance of STILC.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control with Guaranteed Lipschitz Continuity via Filtered Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints, but also raise concerns about the smoothness of the resulting control inputs. While smoothness typically refers to continuity and differentiability, it does not by itself ensure bounded input variation. In contrast, Lipschitz continuity is a stronger form of continuity that not only is necessary for the theoretical guarantee of safety, but also bounds the rate of variation and eliminates abrupt changes in the control input. Such abrupt changes can degrade system performance or even violate actuator limitations, yet current CBF-based methods do not provide Lipschitz continuity guarantees. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system-referred to as an input regularization filter-to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and Lipschitz continuity of the control inputs simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Systems Model of Feedback Optimization for Linear Systems: Convergence and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system using real-time output measurements, which helps mitigate the effects of disturbances. However, existing work often models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which may not accurately model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems model of feedback optimization. We first establish the well-posedness of this hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then we show the state of the system converges exponentially fast to a ball of known radius about a desired goal state. Next we analytically show that this system is robust to perturbations in (i) the values of measured outputs, (ii) the matrices that model the linear time-invariant system, and (iii) the times at which inputs are applied to the system. Simulation results confirm that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances.</description>

Abstract: We establish mathematical bounds on the chain, ABCD and immittance matrices of a multiconductor transmission line, based on the Telegrapher's equation. Closed-form expressions for those matrices are also presented. Existing results that hold on the imaginary axis are extended to the complex plane, without reliance on a diagonalizability assumption that is prevalent in the literature. Therefore, the results remain valid under arbitrary arrangements of the conducting wires, which include electrical faults. The analysis ultimately reveals important system-theoretic implications of the Telegrapher's equation, which are of general relevance to control, power systems, and signal processing involving multiconductor transmission lines.</description>

      <title>Steering the Herd: A Framework for LLM-based Control of Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly serve as information mediators--from social media feeds and targeted advertising to the increasing ubiquity of LLMs. This engenders a joint process where agents combine private, algorithmically-mediated signals with learning from peers to arrive at decisions. To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates.
  We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.</description>

      <title>Constraint Hypergraphs as a Unifying Framework for Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital twins, used to represent physical systems, have been lauded as tools for understanding reality. Complex system behavior is typically captured in domain-specific models crafted by subject experts. Contemporary methods for employing models in a digital twin require prescriptive interfaces, resulting in twins that are difficult to connect, redeploy, and modify. The limited interoperability of these twins has prompted calls for a universal framework enabling observability across model aggregations. Here we show how a new mathematical formalism called a constraint hypergraph addresses these challenges in interoperability. A digital twin is shown to be the second of two coupled systems where both adhere to the same constraint hypergraph, permitting the properties of the first to be observable from the second. Interoperability is given by deconstructing models into a structure enabling autonomous, white-box simulation of system properties. The resulting digital twins can interact immediately with both human and autonomous agents. This is demonstrated in a case study of a microgrid, showing how both measured and simulated data from the aggregated twins can be provided regardless of the operating environment. By connecting models, constraint hypergraphs supply scientists and modelers robust means to capture, communicate, and combine digital twins across all fields of study. We expect this framework to expand the use of digital twins, enriching scientific insights and collaborations by providing a structure for characterizing complex systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Decentralized Sinkhorn for Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed systems require fusing heterogeneous local probability distributions into a global summary over sparse and unreliable communication networks. Traditional consensus algorithms, which average distributions in Euclidean space, ignore their inherent geometric structure, leading to misleading results. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometry-aware alternative by minimizing optimal transport costs, but their entropic approximations via the Sinkhorn algorithm typically require centralized coordination. This paper proposes a fully decentralized Sinkhorn algorithm that reformulates the centralized geometric mean as an arithmetic average in the log-domain, enabling approximation through local gossip protocols. Agents exchange log-messages with neighbors, interleaving consensus phases with local updates to mimic centralized iterations without a coordinator. To optimize bandwidth, we integrate event-triggered transmissions and b-bit quantization, providing tunable trade-offs between accuracy and communication while accommodating asynchrony and packet loss. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence to a neighborhood of the centralized entropic barycenter, with bias linearly dependent on consensus tolerance, trigger threshold, and quantization error. Complexity scales near-linearly with network size. Simulations confirm near-centralized accuracy with significantly fewer messages, across various topologies and conditions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Logistic Growth with Memory Effects: A Tool for Industry-Oriented Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logistic growth model is a classical framework for describing constrained growth phenomena, widely applied in areas such as population dynamics, epidemiology, and resource management. This study presents a generalized extension using Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC)-type fractional derivatives. Proportional time delay is also included, allowing the model to capture memory-dependent and nonlocal dynamics not addressed in classical formulations. Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV) method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system behavior. This approach demonstrates the novelty of integrating ABC-type derivatives, proportional delay, and HSV-based solutions for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Crime/S.I.R. optimal control problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model inspired by control theory to derive optimal public policies for minimizing costs associated with the reduction and control of criminal activity in a population. Specifically, we analyze the optimal control problem \begin{equation*} \min G(u_1, u_2, u_3) = \int_{0}^{t_{\text{F}}} \left( I(t) - R(t) + \frac{B_1}{2} u_1^2(t) + \frac{B_2}{2} u_2^2(t) + \frac{B_3}{2} u_3^2(t) \right) \, dt. \end{equation*} where $I=I(t)$ and $R=R(t)$ satisfies the system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \dot{S} &amp;= \Lambda - (1-u_1)SI - \mu S + ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + \rho \Omega R,\\ \dot{I} &amp;= (1-u_1)SI - (\mu + \delta_1)I - ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + (1-\Omega)\rho R,\\ \dot{R} &amp;= ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - (\mu + \delta_2 + \rho)R. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security. Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model, tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Stabilization of Complex Network Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural and man-made network systems need to maintain certain patterns, such as working at equilibria or limit cycles, to function properly. Thus, the ability to stabilize such patterns is crucial. Most of the existing studies on stabilization assume that network systems states can be measured online so that feedback control strategies can be used. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems states, e.g., neuronal activity in the brain, are often difficult to measure. In this paper, we take this situation into account and study the stabilization problem of linear network systems with an open-loop control strategy (vibrational control). We derive a graph-theoretic sufficient condition for structural vibrational stabilizability, under which network systems can always be stabilized. We further provide an approach to select the locations in the network for control placement and design corresponding vibrational inputs to stabilize systems that satisfy this condition. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with an asymptotic local \textit{linear} convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local \textit{superlinear} convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods with similar guarantees do not offer convergence rates in the nonconvex-nonconcave setting. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria. Code for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/CLeARoboticsLab/ZeroSumGameSolve.jl.</description>

      <title>Is FISHER All You Need in The Multi-AUV Underwater Target Tracking Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is significant to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</description>

      <title>Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Converging Time-Discounted Ergodicity on Graphs for Active Inspection of Confined Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic exploration has spawned a lot of interest in mobile robotics due to its ability to design time trajectories that match desired spatial coverage statistics. However, current ergodic approaches are for continuous spaces, which require detailed sensory information at each point and can lead to fractal-like trajectories that cannot be tracked easily. This paper presents a new ergodic approach for graph-based discretization of continuous spaces. It also introduces a new time-discounted ergodicity metric, wherein early visitations of information-rich nodes are weighted more than late visitations. A Markov chain synthesized using a convex program is shown to converge more rapidly to time-discounted ergodicity than the traditional fastest mixing Markov chain. The resultant ergodic traversal method is used within a hierarchical framework for active inspection of confined spaces with the goal of detecting anomalies robustly using SLAM-driven Bayesian hypothesis testing. Experiments on a ground robot show the advantages of this framework over three continuous space ergodic planners as well as greedy and random exploration methods for left-behind foreign object debris detection in a ballast tank.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Bounds for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation with Arbitrary Norm Contractions and Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Linear Policies in Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian.
  When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Close-Proximity Photovoltaic Panel Coating Using a Quadcopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.</description>
