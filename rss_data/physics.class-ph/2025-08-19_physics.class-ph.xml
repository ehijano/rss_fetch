      <title>Integrals of motion on extremals of the equation Euler-Lagrange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a chain of closed systems of first order ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of moments can be constructed using the Jacobi equation. It is shown that Wronsky determinants for fundamental matrices of closed systems of first order ordinary differential equations are integrals of motion on extremals of the Euler-Lagrange equation.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. III Beam loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent semi-analytical theory of beam loading in inhomogeneous accelerating structures based on the generalized theory of coupled modes is proposed. A single-mode approximation was used when the fields are represented as a sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right travelling eigen wave, and the second with the left. However, this second component is not always a left travelling. When a field is excited by an electron beam it can have complex spatial distribution. The results of calculation of the distribution of electric fields excited by a relativistic electron beam are presented.</description>

      <title>Geometric adiabatic angle in anisotropic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a classical anisotropic oscillator and the Foucault pendulum as examples illustrating non-conservation of action variables in integrable classical mechanical systems with adiabatically slow evolution. We also emphasize the importance of the mass parameter of a harmonic oscillator, alongside its frequency, in explicitly time-dependent situations.</description>

      <title>Torsional vibration of a coupled cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The torsion loading of a coupled cylinder, comprising distinct upper and lower cylindrical sections potentially made of different materials, is considered. The bottom of the cylinder is fixed in place, and induces the cylinder vibration. The torsion is applied via an arbitrary loading on the upper face. Three forms of coupling condition between the upper and lower cylinders are outlined: ideal, soft (weak), and rigid (hard/ stiff) contact. The resulting displacements and tangential stresses are obtained using the finite Hankel transform, and a Green's function representation of the displacement. Numerical results are provided, and the impact of the differing coupling conditions investigated for a range of cylinder geometries, material properties and vibration rates. The resonance frequencies of the coupled cylinder are determined. A method for using the coupled cylinder model to approximate the displacement of a cylinder containing a damaged region via a weak interfacial layer is outlined. The properties of the weak interface layer needed for this approximation are determined, and the advantages of its use in non-destructive testing are discussed.</description>
