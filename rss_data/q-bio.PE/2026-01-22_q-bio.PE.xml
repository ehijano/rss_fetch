      <title>Early warning signals of non-critical transitions from linearised time-varying dynamics with applications to epidemic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been heightened interest from applied mathematicians in infectious disease modelling. Modelling efforts often focus on predicting whether diseases are likely to be eliminated or, instead, (re-)emerge, especially as a result of control measures.This tipping point between elimination and infection waves has been successfully anticipated in the literature through the use of early warning signals and such signals often rely on the theory of critical slowing down. Recent developments have shown that these signals (increases in fluctuation variance and return time) can emerge from the system geometry in the case of non-normal dynamics rather than a change in asymptotic stability. We show how such dynamical behaviour occurs in the fluctuations from the mean-field in general stochastic systems. Using the susceptible-infectious-recovered model as an example application, we analyse how critical-like behaviour can be exploited to anticipate infection waves in the absence of an equilibrium bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Modification speed and radius of higher-order interactions alter the oscillatory dynamics in an agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the population dynamics of ecological systems is crucial for predicting shifts in biodiversity and ensuring the protection of these systems. Established models often focus on pairwise species interactions, yet recent studies have highlighted the importance of higher-order interactions (HOIs) in shaping community structure and function. In this study, we investigate the effects of HOIs in an agent-based model with three species engaged in intransitive competition. We introduce an HOI where one species modifies the competition between the other two. We explore the impact of the strength, radius of influence, and speed of this interaction modification on species abundances and oscillations thereof. Our results show that these abundances are not only greatly impacted by the strength, but also by the radius and speed of the interaction modification. A deeper investigation demonstrates that the changes in the oscillations are caused by the interaction modification itself, and not the change in pairwise interaction strength caused by the HOI. These results emphasize the importance of considering the spatio-temporal scales of higher-order interactions when assessing ecosystem stability, highlighting that such interactions can introduce complex dynamical behaviors that go beyond the predictions of traditional pairwise or simpler higher-order models</description>

      <title>A height-based metaconcept for rooted tree balance and its implications for the $B_1$ index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree balance has received considerable attention in recent years, both in phylogenetics and in other areas. Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.
  Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices.</description>

      <title>The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</description>

      <title>Validating Behavioral Proxies for Disease Risk Monitoring via Large-Scale E-commerce Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital traces of everyday behavior, such as e-commerce (EC) purchase logs, provide scalable signals for population-level monitoring, yet their epidemiological validity remains unclear due to weak links to clinical outcomes.
  We propose a behavioral proxy for disease onset based on transitions from regular to therapeutic diets observed in EC purchase histories, and evaluate its validity through large-scale cross-domain analysis. Using EC purchase data (N = 55,645 users) and independent insurance-derived clinical records, we compare ingredient-level risk patterns and seasonal disease dynamics in feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) as a case study.
  The proxy-based estimates show strong agreement with clinical data, with correlations of r = 0.74 for ingredient-level risk patterns and r = 0.82 for seasonal variation. Both data sources consistently capture elevated disease risk during winter months. Moreover, analysis using EC data alone reproduces established domain knowledge, including the association between higher wet food consumption and lower disease risk.
  Our results demonstrate that behavioral signals derived from large-scale EC data can serve as validated, cost-effective complements to traditional surveillance systems, and suggest broader applicability to monitoring lifestyle-related and chronic conditions.</description>

      <title>Drivers of periodicity in population dynamic models of long-lived, large mammals</title>

Abstract: Population cycles are important components of many natural systems. Most studied in short-lived and small-bodied species, cycles frequently appear to be driven by density-dependent feedbacks. However, compelling evidence of cycles -- often more qualitative than quantitative -- also exists in large mammals. Among ungulates, both density-dependent vital rates and 'cohort effects' (lasting impacts of birth conditions on fecundity and survival) exist, but the implications of such feedbacks for oscillatory population dynamics have not been explored. Here, we present a synthetic model of ungulate population dynamics, parameterized for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) and motivated by extensive Indigenous knowledge suggesting decades-long fluctuations in abundance. Caribou herds are theorized to be subject to both cohort effects and density dependence, and we linked these endogenous factors with environmental stochasticity to understand cycling. Using wavelet analysis, we characterized periodic phenomena and performed sensitivity analyses to clarify the drivers and characteristics of population cycles. We found that cohort effects, predominantly those impacting survival, can produce long-period oscillatory behavior across a wide range of environments and demographic structures. Our modeling framework is generalizable to other long-lived, large-bodied species with complex demography, and collectively, these efforts broaden the scope of inquiry into proximal drivers of population cycling.</description>

      <title>Bounds for survival probabilities in supercritical Galton-Watson processes and applications to population genetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population genetic processes, such as the adaptation of a quantitative trait to directional selection, may occur on longer time scales than the sweep of a single advantageous mutation. To study such processes in finite populations, approximations for the time course of the distribution of a beneficial mutation were derived previously by branching process methods. The application to the evolution of a quantitative trait requires bounds for the probability of survival $S^{(n)}$ up to generation $n$ of a single beneficial mutation. Here, we present a method to obtain a simple, analytically explicit, either upper or lower, bound for $S^{(n)}$ in a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We prove the existence of an upper bound for offspring distributions including Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. They are constructed by bounding the given generating function, $\varphi$, by a fractional linear one that has the same survival probability $S^\infty$ and yields the same rate of convergence of $S^{(n)}$ to $S^\infty$ as $\varphi$. For distributions with at most three offspring, we characterize when this method yields an upper bound, a lower bound, or only an approximation. Because for many distributions it is difficult to get a handle on $S^\infty$, we derive an approximation by series expansion in $s$, where $s$ is the selective advantage of the mutant. We briefly review well-known asymptotic results that generalize Haldane's approximation $2s$ for $S^\infty$, as well as less well-known results on sharp bounds for $S^\infty$. We apply them to explore when bounds for $S^{(n)}$ exist for a family of generalized Poisson distributions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our and of previously derived bounds for $S^\infty$ and $S^{(n)}$. Finally, as an application we determine the response of a quantitative trait caused by new beneficial mutations to prolonged directional selection.</description>

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy (S-entropy)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shannon entropy is not the only entropy that is relevant to machine-learning datasets, nor possibly even the most important one. Traditional entropies such as Shannon entropy capture information represented by elements' frequencies but not the richer information encoded by their similarities and differences. Capturing the latter requires similarity-sensitive entropy (S-entropy). S-entropy can be measured using either the recently developed Leinster-Cobbold-Reeve framework (LCR) or the newer Vendi score (VS). This raises the practical question of which one to use: LCR or VS. Here we address this question conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 large and well-known imaging and tabular datasets. We find that LCR and VS values can differ by orders of magnitude and are complementary, except in limiting cases. We show that both LCR and VS results depend on how similarities are scaled, and introduce the notion of ``half-distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and present evidence that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when a dataset's elements can be usefully interpreted as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system that the dataset describes has a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader case where one simply wishes to capture the rich information encoded by elements' similarities and differences as well as their frequencies, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient--a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses that recur over finite coherence timescales. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition--functional percolation--requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported over finite coherence intervals, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>
