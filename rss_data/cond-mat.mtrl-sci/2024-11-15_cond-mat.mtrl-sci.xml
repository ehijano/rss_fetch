      <title>The rich structural, electronic and bonding landscape of 1$T$-type TaTe$_2$ single-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDW) in single-layer 1$T$-MTe$_2$ (M= Nb, Ta) recently raised large attention because of the contrasting structural and physical behavior with the sulfide and selenide analogues. A first-principles study of fourteen different 1$T$-type TaTe$_2$ single-layers is reported. The importance of Te to Ta electron transfer and multicenter metal-metal bonding in stabilizing different structural modulations is highlighted. Analysis of the electronic structure of the optimized structures provides a rationale for what distinguishes 1$T$-TaTe$_2$ from the related disulfide and diselenide, what are the more stable structural modulations for 1$T$-type TaTe$_2$ single-layers, the possible role of Fermi surface nesting on some of these CDW instabilities, how the CDW affects the metallic properties of the non-distorted lattice and the possibility that some of these CDW phases exhibit exotic properties. All CDW phases studied exhibit band structures typical of metallic systems although some exhibit both very flat and dispersive bands at the Fermi level so that Mott effects could develop; one of the (4$\times$4) phases studied exhibits a Dirac cone at the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic transverse magnetoresistance temperature dependence in Mn3Ga Weyl semimetal with chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal antiferromagnetic D019-Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge, Ga) compounds, with a non-collinear Kagome spin structure, are Weyl semimetals exhibiting novel topological transport properties. The longitudinal magnetoresistance of c-oriented epitaxial Ru/Mn3Ga thin films exhibits a positive quadratic dependence on magnetic field over a wide range of temperatures. Here we describe the transverse magnetoresistance, with the field in the out-of-plane direction, for c-oriented epitaxial GaN (0001)/Mn3Ga films. There is a transition from a negative linear to a positive quadratic dependence on magnetic field in the temperature range from 200 K to 300 K. The electrical resistivity shows a metallic to semiconductor transition at 230 K. By applying the electric field along two perpendicular in-plane directions we find asymmetry in the magnetoresistance curves due to self-spin polarized currents created through magnetic octupole clusters. First principles calculations confirmed the metallic to semiconductor transition corresponds to reordering the spin structure to a higher symmetry configuration.</description>

      <title>Coherently Coupled Carrier and Phonon Dynamics in Elemental Tellurium Probed by Few-Femtosecond Core-Level Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The narrow bandgap semiconductor elemental tellurium (Te) has a unique electronic structure due to strong spin-orbit splitting and a lack of inversion symmetry of its helical lattice. Using broadband extreme ultraviolet core-level transient absorption, we measure simultaneously the coherently coupled photo-induced carrier and lattice dynamics at the Te N$_{4,5}$ edge initiated by a few-cycle NIR pulse. Ultrafast excitation of carriers leads to a coherently excited A$_{\rm{1g}}$ phonon oscillation and the generation of a hot carrier population distribution that oscillates in temperature, and the phonon excursion and hot carrier temperature are $\pi$ out of phase with respect to each other. The depths of modulation suggest a significant coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in Te. A long-lived shift of the absorption edge suggests a metastable excited state of Te in a new equilibrium potential energy surface that lives on the order of the carrier recombination timescale. The observed phonon-induced oscillations of the hot carriers are supportive of a semiconductor-to-metal light-induced phase transition, whereby Te becomes more metallic with increasing phonon-induced displacement. Additionally, near the Fermi level we observe an energy-dependent phase of the displacive excitation of the A$_{\rm{1g}}$ phonon mode. The discovery of coherent coupling between the lattice and hot carriers in Te provides the basis to investigate coherent interactions between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The results spectrally and temporally resolve the correlation between photo-excited hot carriers and coherent lattice excitations, providing insight on the optical manipulation of the tellurium electronic structure at high carrier densities exceeding $10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.</description>

      <title>How orbitals and oxidation states determine apparent topographies in scanning tunneling microscopy: the case of fluorine on silver surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to characterize the early stages of fluorination of silver's (100) and (110) surfaces. In the Ag(100) surface, the hollow site is the most favorable for F adatoms. In the Ag(110) surface, three adsorption sites, namely hollow, long bridge, and short bridge, exhibit similar energies. These locations are also more favorable than an F adatom occupying a vacancy site irrespectively of whether the vacancy was present or not in the pristine surface. The computed energy as a function of surface coverage is used to compute the equilibrium thermodynamics phase diagram. We argue that for the typical pressure and temperature of fluorination experiments, the state of the surface is not determined by thermodynamics but by kinetics. Combining these results with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographic simulations, we propose assignments to features observed experimentally. We present a minimal model of the apparent topography of adatoms in different locations in terms of hydrogenic orbitals, explaining the observed trends. The model links the STM apparent topography to structural information and the oxidation states of the Ag atoms near the adatom.</description>

      <title>A 2D van der Waals Material for Terahertz Emission with Giant Optical Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exfoliation and stacking of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals have created unprecedented opportunities in the discovery of quantum phases. A major obstacle to the advancement of this field is the limited spectroscopic access due to a mismatch in sample sizes (1 - 10 micrometer) and wavelengths (0.1 - 1 millimeter) of electromagnetic radiation relevant to their low-energy excitations. Here, we introduce a new member of the 2D vdW material family: a terahertz (THz) emitter. We show intense and broadband THz generation from the vdW ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2 with optical rectification efficiency over one-order-of-magnitude higher than that of the current standard THz emitter, ZnTe. The NbOI2 THz emitter can be easily integrated into vdW heterostructures for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy of a target vdW material/device. Our approach provides a general spectroscopic tool for the rapidly expanding field of 2D vdW materials and quantum matter.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

      <title>Objective Moir\'e Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moir\'e patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moir\'e patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moir\'e patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moir\'e patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moir\'e patterns and facilitate the application of moir\'e patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Application of signal separation to diffraction image compression and serial crystallography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a real-time analysis of diffraction images acquired at high frame-rate (925 Hz) and its application to macromolecular serial crystallography. The software uses a new signal separation algorithm, able to distinguish the amorphous (or powder diffraction) component from the diffraction signal originating from single crystals. It relies on the ability to work efficiently in azimuthal space and derives from the work performed on pyFAI, the fast azimuthal integration library. Two applications are built upon this separation algorithm: a lossy compression algorithm and a peak-picking algo- rithm; the performances of both is assessed by comparing data quality after reduction with XDS and CrystFEL.</description>

      <title>Is the gain-voltage dependence of SiPMs linear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain-voltage dependence for SiPMs from Ref.1 is reanalyzed and a non-linearity at the sub-percent level is observed. Simulations show that the non-linearity can be explained by the increase of the depletion depth of the avalanche region with over-voltage. A consequence of the non-linearity is that the voltage at which the discharge stops is systematically underestimated if a linear extrapolation is used.</description>

      <title>A Message Passing Neural Network Surrogate Model for Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peridynamics is a non-local continuum mechanics theory that offers unique advantages for modeling problems involving discontinuities and complex deformations. Within the peridynamic framework, various formulations exist, among which the material correspondence formulation stands out for its ability to directly incorporate traditional continuum material models, making it highly applicable to a range of engineering challenges. A notable advancement in this area is the bond-associated correspondence model, which not only resolves issues of material instability but also achieves high computational accuracy. However, the bond-associated model typically requires higher computational costs than FEA, which can limit its practical application. To address this computational challenge, we propose a novel surrogate model based on a message-passing neural network (MPNN) specifically designed for the bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence formulation. Leveraging the similarities between graph structure and the neighborhood connectivity inherent to peridynamics, we construct an MPNN that can transfers domain knowledge from peridynamics into a computational graph and shorten the computation time via GPU acceleration. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that focus on node features, our model emphasizes edge-based features, capturing the essential material point interactions in the formulation. A key advantage of this neural network approach is its flexibility: it does not require fixed neighborhood connectivity, making it adaptable across diverse configurations and scalable for complex systems. Furthermore, the model inherently possesses translational and rotational invariance, enabling it to maintain physical objectivity: a critical requirement for accurate mechanical modeling.</description>

      <title>X-ray measurements of gas distribution in a zero gap alkaline water electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray radioscopy was used to measure the 2D projected dynamic void fraction in a zero/narrow gap alkaline water electrolyzer at a spatial resolution of 15 $\mu$m, for narrow gap sizes up to 300 $\mu$m and current densities up to 0.54 A/cm$^2$. As expected, the void fraction in the bulk was found to increase along the cell height and with increasing current density. The void fraction measured in the gap region (the space between the diaphragm and the electrode and its holes) was always larger than in the bulk. It hardly depended on the gap size at current densities below 0.3 A/cm$^2$. The lowest cell potential was measured for zero gap. No evidence of isolating gas pockets/films in the gaps was found. Liquid crossover and oxygen void fraction exceeding the hydrogen void fraction occurred for porous plate electrodes, but these phenomena were suppressed for perforated foil electrodes.</description>

      <title>Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Topological Quantum Chemistry and Catalog of Topological Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the topological quantum chemistry formalism to layer groups, and apply it to study the band topology of 8,872 entries from the computational two-dimensional (2D) materials databases C2DB and MC2D. In our analysis, we find 4,073 topologically non-trivial or obstructed atomic insulator entries, including 905 topological insulators, 602 even-electron number topological semimetals, and 1,003 obstructed atomic insulators. We thus largely expand the library of known topological or obstructed materials in two dimensions, beyond the few hundreds known to date. We additionally classify the materials into four categories: experimentally existing, stable, computationally exfoliated, and not stable. We present a detailed analysis of the edge states emerging in a number of selected new materials, and compile a Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB) containing the band structures and detailed topological properties of all the materials studied in this work. The methodology here developed is implemented in new programs available to the public, designed to study the topology of any non-magnetic monolayer or multilayer 2D material.</description>

      <title>Fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. We then engineer a fermionic color code which corrects for both phase and loss errors. We show how to realize a universal fermionic gate set in this code, including transversal Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we realize qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for simulating fermions. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates by introducing a neutral-atom braiding gate using photodissociation of bosonic molecules. As an application, we consider the fermionic fast Fourier transform, an important subroutine for simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ and a linear improvement from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ in Clifford gate complexity compared to state-of-the-art qubit-only approaches. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Photon Blockade and Quantum Light Generation from Cavity Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g2(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS2 flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be a general feature of TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.</description>

      <title>Solving the Inverse Band-Structure Problem for Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall effect and \textit{A}-phase in hexagonal polar magnet Gd$_3$Ni$_8$Sn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent theoretical studies have positioned noncollinear polar magnets with $C_{nv}$ symmetry as compelling candidates for realizing topological magnetic phases and substantial intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, experimental realizations of the same in strongly correlated systems remain rare. Here, we present a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and extended topological magnetic ordering in Gd$_3$Ni$_8$Sn$_4$ with hexagonal $C_{6v}$ symmetry. Observation of topological Hall response, corroborated by metamagnetic anomalies in isothermal magnetization, peak/hump features in field-evolution of ac susceptibility and longitudinal resistivity, attests to the stabilization of skyrmion $A$-phase. The anomalous Hall effect is quantitatively accounted for by the intrinsic Berry curvature-mediated mechanism. Our results underscore polar magnets as a promising platform to investigate a plethora of emergent electrodynamic responses rooted in the interplay between magnetism and topology.</description>

      <title>Chiral Light-Matter Interactions with Thermal Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semi-analytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As an illustration of their capabilities, we demonstrate that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Charge-Neutral Electronic Excitations in Quantum Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on quantum materials have uncovered many interesting quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to a variety of topological quantum matter including the recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators. The findings have come in parallel with the development of approaches to probe the rich excitations inherent in such systems. In contrast to observing electrically charged excitations, the detection of charge-neutral electronic excitations in condensed matter remains difficult, though they are essential to understanding a large class of strongly correlated phases. Low-energy neutral excitations are especially important in characterizing unconventional phases featuring electron fractionalization, such as quantum spin liquids, spin ices, and insulators with neutral Fermi surfaces. In this perspective, we discuss searches for neutral fermionic, bosonic, or anyonic excitations in unconventional insulators, highlighting theoretical and experimental progress in probing excitonic insulators, new quantum spin liquid candidates and emergent correlated insulators based on two-dimensional layered crystals and moir\'e materials. We outline the promises and challenges in probing and utilizing quantum insulators, and discuss exciting new opportunities for future advancements offered by ideas rooted in next-generation quantum materials, devices, and experimental schemes.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetization process of a quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet: Two-step symmetry restoration and dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a comprehensive thermodynamic study of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) quantum magnet Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br which in the 2D layer can be viewed as strongly coupled alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic chains. In an applied magnetic field transverse to the ordered spins below $T_N=9.3$ K, a field-induced phase transition from the 3D ordered to a disordered phase occurs at $B_c=16.3$ T for the lowest temperature, which is featured by an onset of a one-half plateau-like magnetization. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the relevant 2D model, we find that the plateau-like magnetization corresponds to a partial symmetry restoration and the full polarization in the ferromagnetic chains. Our numerical simulations also show that the magnetization saturation occurs with full symmetry restoration at a much higher field of $B_s \simeq 95$ T, corresponding to a 1D quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic chains. We argue that the experimentally observed field-induced phase transition at $B_c$ follows from the partial symmetry restoration and the concomitant dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <title>On the Ferrimagnetic State of CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals layered ferromagnetic compounds with high two-dimensional electronic conductivity holds strong potential for quantum computing, future unconventional superconductors, catalysts, batteries, and fuel cells. We suggest a minimal theoretical model to understand the magnetic properties of the metal-organic framework CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$ (pyz=pyrazine). Using a Hubbard model we show that the groundstate is dominated by a specific configuration of delocalized electrons on the pyz sites with a ferrimagnetic coupling to the localized spins on the Cr sites. This model suggests a magnetic moment of $2\mu_B$ which is remarkably close to the experimental value of $1.8 \mu_B$ [K. S. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field theory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 0.9$ meV. This is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY interaction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 5$ meV. Understanding the interactions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of metal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe- mission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

Abstract: The atomic environments of semiconductor heterostructures can be highly varied as various structural imperfections, lattice mismatch and non-uniform strain environments are generally present. The computational costs of first-principles modeling techniques make it challenging to fully explore how atomic environments tune the electronic bands of heterostructures. We present a machine learning (ML)-assisted first-principles modeling framework that establishes a direct relationship between the atomic environments and the electronic bands of semiconductor heterostructures. The framework combines a forward and a reverse model: The forward model predicts how the atomic environments tune electronic bands; The reverse learning model extracts information about the atomic environments that is associated with an input band structure image, such as the ones obtained with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We demonstrate the framework using silicon/germanium-based superlattices and heterostructures. Our framework offers a physics-informed approach to designing heterostructures for new phenomena and device possibilities for diverse technologies, going beyond trial-and-error approaches.</description>

      <title>Catalog of Unconventional Magnons in Collinear Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnons have garnered significant interest for their potential in both fundamental research and device applications, owing to their exotic, uncharged, yet topologically protected boundary modes. However, their comprehension has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic materials, which are primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions in spin Hamiltonians. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups (MSGs), thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group (SSG) theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1421 collinear SSGs into four types, constructing their band representations, and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines, and charge-4 octuple points. Based on the MAGNDATA database, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which over 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of the spin-orbit coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80% are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that SSG serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets.

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>

Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals are a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) that enable the prediction of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties. More broadly, this work demonstrates that measuring violations of piecewise linearity (i.e. curvature in total energies with respect to occupancies) can be done efficiently by combining frozen-orbital approximations and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall and Edelstein Effects in Novel Chiral Noncollinear Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly discovered class of magnetic phases that combine the spin polarization behavior of ferromagnetic band structures with the vanishing net magnetization characteristic of antiferromagnets. Initially proposed for collinear magnets, the concept has since been extended to include certain non-collinear structures. A recent development in Landau theory for collinear altermagnets incorporates spin-space symmetries, providing a robust framework for identifying this class of materials. Here we expand on that theory to identify altermagnetic multipolar order parameters in non-collinear chiral materials. We demonstrate that the interplay between non-collinear altermagnetism and chirality allows for spatially odd multipole components, leading to non-trivial spin textures on Fermi surfaces and unexpected transport phenomena, even in the absence of SOC. This makes such chiral altermagnets fundamentally different from the well-known SOC-driven Rashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects used for 2D spintronics. Choosing the chiral topological magnetic material Mn$_3$IrSi as a case study, we apply toy models and first-principles calculations to predict experimental signatures, such as large spin-Hall and Edelstein effects, that have not been previously observed in altermagnets. These findings pave the way for a new realm of spintronics applications based on spin-transport properties of chiral altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Twisted coupled wire model for a moir\'e sliding Luttinger liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ revealed the existence of anisotropic Luttinger liquid behavior. To generically characterize such anisotropic twisted bilayer systems, we study a model of a twisted bilayer of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of coupled wires, which effectively form an array of coupled moir\'e wires. We solve the model by the transfer matrix method, and identify quasi-1D electron bands in the system at small twist angles. With electron interactions added, we show that the moir\'e wires have an effective Luttinger parameter $g_\text{eff}$ much lower than that of the microscopic wires. This leads to a sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) temperature regime, in which power-law current voltage relations arise. For parameters partly estimated from WTe$_2$, a microscopic interaction $U\sim0.7$eV yields a temperature regime of SLL similar to that in the WTe$_2$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mobility carriers in topological kagome bad metal Mn$_3$Sn by intense photoexcitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome-lattice materials offer novel playgrounds of exploring topologically nontrivial states of electrons under influence of many-body interactions. A noncollinear kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn has attracted particular interest for application in spintronics owing to the large anomalous Hall effect related to the Weyl dispersion near the Fermi energy. In addition, strong electronic correlation suggesting the Kondo physics has also been implied. However, the effect of correlation on the band topology and their interplay remains elusive. Here, we investigate nonequilibrium Hall transport in a photoexcited Mn$_3$Sn using time-resolved terahertz Faraday rotation spectroscopy. In equilibrium, Mn$_3$Sn is a bad metal close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regal limit with low carrier mobility, and thus only the anomalous Hall effect is discerned. By contrast, intense photoexcitation beyond an approximate threshold gives rise to a clear cyclotron resonance, namely the normal Hall effect, indicating the emergence of unusual carriers with 50 times lighter effective mass and 40 times less scattering. The lifetime of high-mobility carriers as long as a few tens of picoseconds and a threshold-like behavior for the pump fluence are hardly explained by contribution of photoexcited hot carriers. Instead, the emergence of unusual carriers may be accounted for by dielectric screening of the on-site Coulomb interaction by high-density delocalized photocarriers. A possible role of electronic correlation in equilibrium transport in Mn$_3$Sn beyond the single-particle picture is discussed.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable magnetic and magnonic states in Ni-dihalide monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monolayer NiI$_2$ garners large research interest due to its multiferroic behavior stemming from the interplay between its non-collinear magnetic order and the spin-orbit coupling. This prompts an investigation into the stability of the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli. In this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the magnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of the NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal intricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic, helimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of considering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We reveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic ground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we demonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer Ni-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for the predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a magnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon modes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Scattering of CO from Vacant-MoSe$_2$ with O Adsorbates: Is CO$_2$ Formed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, based on density functional theory that also accounts for van der Waals interactions, we study the oxidation of gas phase CO on MoSe$_2$ with a Se vacancy and oxygen coverage of 0.125~ML. In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>
