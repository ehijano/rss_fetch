      <description>arXiv:2508.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and construction of a neutron shielding for the SND@LHC detector, which utilizes a combination of plexiglass and borated polyethylene, is presented. FLUKA simulations were employed to optimize the shielding configuration and assess its efficiency. Results indicate a significant reduction in neutron flux, ensuring the long-term stability of the emulsion films used in the target of the SND@LHC detector.</description>

      <title>The DeepFMKit Python package: A toolbox for simulating and analyzing deep frequency modulation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.</description>

      <title>A 3D segmented Water-based Liquid Scintillator for high-precision detection of neutrinos in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision detection of neutrino-nucleus interactions in water with the complete detection of the final state, including leptons and hadrons, is challenging due to water being a non-scintillating medium. This can be a limitation for the next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, where the neutrino-nucleus interaction models must reach a few percent-level accuracy. Water-based liquid scintillator can be a game changer for the future near detectors. In this article, we propose a novel design consisting of a 3D highly-segmented water-based liquid scintillator. The water-based liquid scintillator is encapsulated within a highly-segmented rigid but very light structure that provides the optical isolation with a 1 cm$^{3}$ granularity, each read out by orthogonal wavelength shifting fibers, and 81\% of water by mass in the active volume. Such configuration is also suitable for pure liquid scintillator. The detector design, prototyped and validated with cosmic ray data, is described and results are reported. The optical model is studied with Monte Carlo simulations and results are compared with the collected data.</description>

      <title>Leaf-inspired rain-energy harvesting device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a rain-powered energy-harvesting device inspired by the natural impact of raindrops on leaves. In nature, a raindrop striking a leaf at high speed causes it to deform and vibrate. Inspired by this, our device uses an elastic beam coupled with a piezoelectric material to convert mechanical vibrations from droplet impacts into electrical energy. We conduct experiments to analyze how beam length, droplet impact location, and residual droplet mass affect energy conversion. Our results, supported by a theoretical model, show strong agreement when the beam length exceeds 5 cm. Beyond this length, the energy conversion becomes independent of further increases, suggesting that 5 cm is optimal for maximizing output. To validate practical applicability, we also test the device under real rain conditions, demonstrating consistent performance. Understanding the interplay between raindrop dynamics and energy conversion can guide the design of efficient, scalable rain-powered energy-harvesting systems for environmental applications.</description>

      <title>First Beam Neutrinos Observed with an LAPPD in the ANNIE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) probes the physics of neutrino-nucleus interactions in a gadolinium-loaded water (Gd-water) target while serving as a flexible testbed for advanced next-generation optical neutrino detection technologies. These advanced technologies include novel detection media (particularly Gd-water and hybrid Cherenkov-scintillation through water-based liquid scintillator) and novel photosensors. In this paper we demonstrate the first implementation of a fully-integrated setup for Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetectors (LAPPDs) in a neutrino experiment. Details are presented regarding the design, commissioning, and deployment of an LAPPD and the supporting systems. We also present the first neutrino interactions ever observed with an LAPPD.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the velocity response of a table-top EPR Speedmeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.</description>

      <title>Thermography Equation: From Conceptual Relation to Quantitative Formulation via the Optogeometric Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a methodological transition from the conceptually formulated thermographic measurement equation (the so called thermography equation) to its quantitative form, expressed through the optogeometric factor. This factor directly links the known radiant flux from the measured surface to the energy captured by a single pixel of a thermal camera. The formulation is based on geometric optical relations between the scene and the detector and is applicable to both scene-based and sensor-based approaches. The resulting expression provides a general framework for quantitative thermography.</description>

      <title>Particle identification in the GlueX detector with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both MLPs and BDTs can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with 50 dB of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (200 MHz vs. 80 MHz).</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Variational Autoencoders for At-Source Data Reduction and Anomaly Detection in High Energy Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detectors in next-generation high-energy physics experiments face several daunting requirements, such as high data rates, damaging radiation exposure, and stringent constraints on power, space, and latency. To address these challenges, machine learning in readout electronics can be leveraged for smart detector designs, enabling intelligent inference and data reduction at-source. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a variety of benefits for front-end readout; an on-sensor encoder can perform efficient lossy data compression while simultaneously providing a latent space representation that can be used for anomaly detection. Results are presented from low-latency and resource-efficient VAEs for front-end data processing in a futuristic silicon pixel detector. Encoder-based data compression is found to preserve good performance of off-detector analysis while significantly reducing the off-detector data rate as compared to a similarly sized data filtering approach. Furthermore, the latent space information is found to be a useful discriminator in the context of real-time sensor defect monitoring. Together, these results highlight the multifaceted utility of autoencoder-based front-end readout schemes and motivate their consideration in future detector designs.</description>
