      <title>Application of hybrid classical-quantum annealing technology to the 3D Bin-Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of hybrid classical-quantum annealing technology to solve a critical business optimization problem that is a form of multiproduct multi-bin packing in three dimensions with support constraints and case orientations along all three axes. We developed an exact mathematical model based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) to solve the problem, using fewer variables than previously existing models. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the cases within bins, the model employs a novel formulation to represent the support constraints. We then compared and analyzed the solution performance of the classical solver Gurobi and D-Wave's constrained quadratic model (CQM) solver on the MIP model, both with and without support constraints. Results from the computational studies offer valuable insights into how the hybrid classical-quantum solver compares against widely used purely classical solvers on computationally hard problems, such as the problem of interest. This comparison examines aspects such as the optimality gap and volume utilization across different computational time limits.</description>

      <title>Computing optimal partition problems via Lagrange multiplier approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider numerical approximations for the optimal partition problem using Lagrange multipliers. By rewriting it into constrained gradient flows, three and four steps numerical schemes based on the Lagrange multiplier approach \cite{ChSh22,ChSh_II22} are proposed to solve the constrained gradient system. Numerical schemes proposed for the constrained gradient flows satisfy the nice properties of orthogonality-preserving, norm-preserving, positivity-preserving and energy dissipating. The proposed schemes are very efficient in which only linear Poisson equations are solved at each time step. Extensive numerical results in 2D and 3D for optimal partition problem are presented to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Assessing solution quality in risk-averse stochastic programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an optimization problem, the quality of a candidate solution can be characterized by the optimality gap. For most stochastic optimization problems, this gap must be statistically estimated. We show that standard estimators are optimistically biased for risk-averse problems, which compromises the statistical guarantee on the optimality gap. We introduce estimators for risk-averse problems that do not suffer from this bias. Our method relies on using two independent samples, each estimating a different component of the optimality gap. Our approach extends a broad class of methods for estimating the optimality gap from the risk-neutral case to the risk-averse case, such as the multiple replications procedure and its one- and two-sample variants. Our approach can further make use of existing bias and variance reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Inherently Robust Economic Model Predictive Control Without Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the terminal cost and constraint such that economic model predictive control (MPC) is robustly recursively feasible and economically robust to small disturbances without any assumptions of dissipativity. Moreover, we demonstrate that these sufficient conditions can be satisfied with standard design methods. A small example is presented to illustrate the inherent robustness of economic MPC to small disturbances.</description>

      <title>Co-optimization of spacecraft and low-thrust trajectory with direct methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-powered electric propulsion systems can operate in multiple modes and their operation is coupled to the power generated by solar arrays. However, the power produced by the solar arrays is a function of the solar array size and heliocentric distance to the Sun, which also depends on the to-be-optimized trajectory. The optimization of spacecraft solar array size, thruster modes, and trajectory can be performed simultaneously, capitalizing on the inherent couplings. In this work, we co-optimize the spacecraft's solar array size, thruster modes, and trajectory using a direct optimization, which allows for maximizing the net delivered mass. A particular challenge arises due to the existence of discrete operating modes. We proposed a method for smoothly selecting optimal operation modes among a set of finite possible modes. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated successfully by solving a benchmark problem, i.e., the Earth to Comet 67P fixed-time rendezvous problem. The results indicate that utilizing multiple modes increases the net useful mass compared to a single mode and leads to a smaller solar array size for the spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Stability of Primal-Dual Gradient Flow Dynamics for Multi-Block Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we provide a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of various primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods, e.g., standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed dynamics for parallel and distributed computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a functional on the space of spectral risk measures that quantifies their ``degree of risk aversion''. This quantification formalizes the idea that some risk measures are ``more risk-averse'' than others. I construct the functional using two axioms: a normalization on the space of CVaRs and a linearity axiom. I present two formulas for the functional and discuss several properties and interpretations.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Dynamic Games as Receding-Horizon Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamic games with linear dynamics and quadratic objective functions. We observe that the unconstrained open-loop Nash equilibrium coincides with the LQR in an augmented space, thus deriving an explicit expression of the cost-to-go. With such cost-to-go as a terminal cost, we show asymptotic stability for the receding-horizon solution of the finite-horizon, constrained game. Furthermore, we show that the problem is equivalent to a non-symmetric variational inequality, which does not correspond to any Nash equilibrium problem. For unconstrained closed-loop Nash equilibria, we derive a receding-horizon controller that is equivalent to the infinite-horizon one and ensures asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>Two-stage model reduction approaches for the efficient and certified solution of parametrized optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we develop an efficient reduced order model for solving parametrized linear-quadratic optimal control problems with linear time-varying state system. The fully reduced model combines reduced basis approximations of the system dynamics and of the manifold of optimal final time adjoint states to achieve a computational complexity independent of the original state space. Such a combination is particularly beneficial in the case where a deviation in a low-dimensional output is penalized. In addition, an offline-online decomposed a posteriori error estimator bounding the error between the approximate final time adjoint with respect to the optimal one is derived and its reliability proven. We propose different strategies for building the involved reduced order models, for instance by separate reduction of the dynamical systems and the final time adjoint states or via greedy procedures yielding a combined and fully reduced model. These algorithms are evaluated and compared for a two-dimensional heat equation problem. The numerical results show the desired accuracy of the reduced models and highlight the speedup obtained by the newly combined reduced order model in comparison to an exact computation of the optimal control or other reduction approaches.</description>

      <title>Regularized Step Directions in Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjugate gradient minimization methods (CGM) and their accelerated variants are widely used. We focus on the use of cubic regularization to improve the CGM direction independent of the step length computation. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM, where regularized steps are used selectively. Using Shanno's reformulation of CGM as a memoryless BFGS method, we derive new formulas for the regularized step direction. We show that the regularized step direction uses the same order of computational burden per iteration as its non-regularized version. Moreover, the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM exhibits global convergence with fewer assumptions. In numerical experiments, the new step directions are shown to require fewer iteration counts, improve runtime, and reduce the need to reset the step direction. Overall, the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM exhibits the same memoryless and matrix-free properties, while outperforming CGM as a memoryless BFGS method in iterations and runtime.</description>

      <title>Exact output tracking in prescribed finite time via funnel control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Output reference tracking of unknown nonlinear systems is considered. The control objective is exact tracking in predefined finite time, while in the transient phase the tracking error evolves within a prescribed boundary. To achieve this, a novel high-gain feedback controller is developed that is similar to, but extends, existing high-gain feedback controllers. Feasibility and functioning of the proposed controller is proven rigorously. Examples for the particular control objective under consideration are, for instance, linking up two train sections, or docking of spaceships.</description>

      <title>Towards An Analytical Framework for Dynamic Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potential game is an emerging notion and framework for studying N-player games, especially with heterogeneous players. In this paper, we build an analytical framework for dynamic potential games. We prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if and only if each player's value function can be decomposed as a potential function and a residual term which is solely dependent on other players' policies. This decomposition is consistent with the result in the static setting and enables us to identify and analyze an important and new class of dynamic potential games called the distributed game. Moreover, we prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if the value function has a symmetric Jacobian. This generalizes the differential characterization for static potential games by replacing the classical derivative with a new notation of functional derivative with respect to Markov policies. For a general class of continuous-time stochastic games, we explicitly characterize their potential functions. In particular, we show that the potential function of linear-quadratic games can be studied through a system of linear ODEs. Furthermore, under a rank condition on control coefficients, we prove a linear-quadratic game is a Markov potential game if and only if all players have identical cost functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze integer linear programs which we obtain after discretizing two-dimensional subproblems arising from a trust-region algorithm for mixed integer optimal control problems with total variation regularization. We discuss NP-hardness of the discretized problems and the connection to graph-based problems. We show that the underlying polyhedron exhibits structural restrictions in its vertices with regards to which variables can attain fractional values at the same time. Based on this property, we derive cutting planes by employing a relation to shortest-path and minimum bisection problems. We propose a branching rule and a primal heuristic which improves previously found feasible points. We validate the proposed tools with a numerical benchmark in a standard integer programming solver. We observe a significant speedup for medium-sized problems. Our results give hints for scaling towards larger instances in the future.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Robust Planning of Networked Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids: A Study on Induced Refueling Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-electrical microgrids are increasingly assuming an important role on the pathway toward decarbonization of energy and transportation systems. This paper studies networked hydrogen-electrical microgrids planning (NHEMP), considering a critical but often-overlooked issue, i.e., the demand-inducing effect (DIE) associated with infrastructure development decisions. Specifically, higher refueling capacities will attract more refueling demand of hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). To capture such interactions between investment decisions and induced refueling demand, we introduce a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set and build a trilevel stochastic-robust formulation. The upper-level determines optimal investment strategies for hydrogen-electrical microgrids, the lower-level optimizes the risk-aware operation schedules across a series of stochastic scenarios, and, for each scenario, the middle-level identifies the "worst" situation of refueling demand within an individual DDU set to ensure economic feasibility. Then, an adaptive and exact decomposition algorithm, based on Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&amp;CG), is customized and developed to address the computational challenge and to quantitatively analyze the impact of DIE. Case studies on an IEEE exemplary system validate the effectiveness of the proposed NHEMP model and the PC&amp;CG algorithm. It is worth highlighting that DIE can make an important contribution to the economic benefits of NHEMP, yet its significance will gradually decrease when the main bottleneck transits to other system restrictions.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of control-affine systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically. We bring as a numerical example the Schr\"odinger equation for a qubit with uncertain resonance frequency.</description>

Abstract: This article is concerned with an extension of univariate Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to the multivariate setting, where one chases best approximants to specific monomials by polynomials of lower degree relative to the uniform norm. Exploiting the Moment-SOS hierarchy, we devise a versatile semidefinite-programming-based procedure to compute such best approximants, as well as associated signatures. Applying this procedure in three variables leads to the values of best approximation errors for all mononials up to degree six on the euclidean ball, the simplex, and the cross-polytope. Furthermore, inspired by numerical experiments, we obtain explicit expressions for Chebyshev polynomials in two cases unresolved before, namely for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3$ on the euclidean ball and for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2 x_3$ on the simplex.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal $L_p$ Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex risk measures play a foundational role in the area of stochastic optimization. However, in contrast to risk neutral models, their applications are still limited due to the lack of efficient solution methods. In particular, the mean $L_p$ semi-deviation is a classic risk minimization model, but its solution is highly challenging due to the composition of concave-convex functions and the lack of uniform Lipschitz continuity. In this paper, we discuss some progresses on the design of efficient algorithms for $L_p$ risk minimization, including a novel lifting reformulation to handle the concave-convex composition, and a new stochastic approximation method to handle the non-Lipschitz continuity. We establish an upper bound on the sample complexity associated with this approach and show that this bound is not improvable for $L_p$ risk minimization in general.</description>

      <title>On optimality conditions for multivariate Chebyshev approximation and convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review state-of-the-art optimality conditions of multivariate Chebyshev approximation, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. These conditions are then re-interpreted using the optimality conditions of convex optimization, subdifferential and directional derivative. Finally, this new point of view is used to derive new optimality conditions for the following problems: First for the multivariate Chebyshev approximation with a weight function. Second, the approximation problem proposed by Arzelier, Br ehard and Joldes (26th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic 2019) consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the first order approximation of the worst case evaluation error of the polynomial in Horner form.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Systems with Dynamic User Utility Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained significant attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most related studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently, computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters change. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that allows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their application layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as the policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm iteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA)--RA without considering user utility demands--among active users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. Derived convergence analyses provide guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical experiments corroborate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for non-monotonic dose response, with an application to a kinetic proofreading model -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady state nonmonotonic ("biphasic") dose responses are often observed in experimental biology, which raises the control-theoretic question of identifying which possible mechanisms might underlie such behaviors. It is well known that the presence of an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) in a network may give rise to a nonmonotonic response. It has been conjectured that this condition is also necessary, i.e. that a nonmonotonic response implies the existence of an IFFL. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is false, and in the process prove a weaker version: that either an IFFL must exist or both a positive feedback loop and a negative feedback loop must exist. Towards this aim, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when minors of a symbolic matrix have mixed signs. Finally, we study in full generality when a model of immune T-cell activation could exhibit a steady state nonmonotonic dose response.</description>

      <title>Putting all eggs in one basket: some insights from a correlation inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give examples of situations -- stochastic production, military tactics, corporate merger -- where it is beneficial to concentrate risk rather than to diversify it, that is, to put all eggs in one basket. Our examples admit a dual interpretation: as optimal strategies of a single player (the `principal') or, alternatively, as dominant strategies in a non-cooperative game with multiple players (the `agents').
  The key mathematical result can be formulated in terms of a convolution structure on the set of increasing functions on a Boolean lattice (the lattice of subsets of a finite set). This generalizes the well-known Harris inequality from statistical physics and discrete mathematics; we give a simple self-contained proof of this result, and prove a further generalization based on the game-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear and non-smooth parabolic obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence, uniqueness, and $W^{1,2,p}$-regularity of solutions to fully-nonlinear, parabolic obstacle problems when the obstacle is the pointwise supremum of functions in $W^{1,2,p}$ and the nonlinear operator is required only to be measurable in the state and time variables. In particular, the results hold for all convex obstacles. Applied to stopping problems, they provide general conditions under which a decision maker never stops at a convex kink of the stopping payoff. The proof relies on new $W^{1,2,p}$-estimates for obstacle problems when the obstacle is the maximum of finitely many functions in $W^{1,2,p}$.</description>

      <title>Halfway Escape Optimization: A Quantum-Inspired Solution for General Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02850v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address general optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating general optimization problems and providing valuable insights into its performance. The test of HEO in Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential in real-time applications. Further validation in Osmancik-97 and Cammeo Rice Classification proves the effectiveness of HEO and achieves a higher accuracy record.</description>
