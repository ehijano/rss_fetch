      <title>The Unreliable Job Selection and Sequencing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic single-machine scheduling problem, denoted the Unreliable Job Selection and Sequencing Problem (UJSSP). Given a set of jobs, a subset must be selected for processing on a single machine that is subject to failure. Each job incurs a cost if selected and yields a reward upon successful completion. A job is completed successfully only if the machine does not fail before or during its execution, with job-specific probabilities of success. The objective is to determine an optimal subset and sequence of jobs to maximize the expected net profit. We analyze the computational complexity of UJSSP and prove that it is NP-hard in the general case. The relationship of UJSSP with other submodular selection problems is discussed, showing that the special cases in which all jobs have the same cost or the same failure probability can be solved in polynomial time. To compute optimal solutions, we propose a compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation, a dynamic programming algorithm, and two novel stepwise exact algorithms. We demonstrate that our methods are capable of efficiently solving large instances by means of extensive computational experiments. We further show the broader applicability of our stepwise algorithms by solving instances derived from the Product Partition Problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Extracting Maximum-Size $(k,\ell)$-Sparse Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multigraph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, \ell)$-sparse if every subset $X \subseteq V$ induces at most $\max\{k|X| - \ell, 0\}$ edges. Finding a maximum-size $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Computational Framework for Discrete Fuzzy Numbers Based on Total Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \{0, \ldots, n\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 &lt; y_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; y_{m-1} &lt; y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.</description>

      <title>Independent sets and colorings of $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ajtai, Erd\H{o}s, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi conjectured in 1981 that for every graph $F$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size $\Omega(n \log d / d)$. The largest class of graphs for which this was previously known was established by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 1999, who proved it for the so-called almost bipartite graphs, namely subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$.
  We prove the conjecture for all 3-colorable graphs $F$, i.e., subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress on the problem in more than 25 years. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the R\"odl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Tur\'an-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.
  A closely related conjecture of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (1999) asserts that any $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has chromatic number $O(\Delta / \log \Delta)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite. We also establish this conjecture for all $3$-colorable graphs $F$, representing the first progress toward the conjecture since it was posed.</description>

      <title>Triangle Detection in H-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of combinatorial algorithms for Triangle Detection in $H$-free graphs. The goal is to decide if a graph that forbids a fixed pattern $H$ as a subgraph contains a triangle, using only "combinatorial" methods that notably exclude fast matrix multiplication. Our work aims to classify which patterns admit a subcubic speedup, working towards a dichotomy theorem. On the lower bound side, we show that if $H$ is not $3$-colorable or contains more than one triangle, the complexity of the problem remains unchanged, and no combinatorial speedup is likely possible. On the upper bound side, we develop an embedding approach that results in a strongly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for a rich class of "embeddable" patterns. Specifically, for an embeddable pattern of size $k$, our algorithm runs in $\tilde O(n^{3-\frac{1}{2^{k-3}}})$ time, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides poly-logarithmic factors. This algorithm also extends to listing all the triangles within the same time bound. We supplement this main result with two generalizations: 1) A generalization to patterns that are embeddable up to a single obstacle that arises from a triangle in the pattern. This completes our classification for small patterns, yielding a dichotomy theorem for all patterns of size up to eight. 2) An $H$-sensitive algorithm for embeddable patterns, which runs faster when the number of copies of $H$ is significantly smaller than the maximum possible $\Omega(n^k)$. Finally, we focus on the special case of odd cycles. We present specialized Triangle Detection algorithms that are very efficient: 1) A combinatorial algorithm for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs that runs in $\tilde O(m+n^{1+2/k})$ time for every $k\geq2$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. 2) A combinatorial $C_5$-sensitive algorithm that runs in $\tilde O(n^2+n^{4/3}t^{1/3})$ time, where $t$ is the number of $5$-cycles in the graph.</description>

      <title>Fast Decoding for Non-Adaptive Learning of Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with \(n\) nodes and \(k\) edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring \(\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)\) tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graphs \(G\sim\ER(n,q)\) in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is \(\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}\), and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) but incurs \(\Omega(n^2)\) decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra \((\log \bar{k})(\log n)\) factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) tests while attaining decoding time \(O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)\) for any fixed \(\delta&gt;0\).</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of QAOA on Constrained Problems and a Route to Exponential Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of the generic Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on constrained problems where valid solutions form a low dimensional manifold inside the Boolean hypercube, and we present a provable route to exponential improvements via constraint embedding. Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for rotor-routing that extends the classical model to a broad class of multigraphs equipped with Generalized Rotor Mechanisms (GRM). This perspective places rotor-routing on the same footing as abelian sandpiles by interpreting both as conservative instances of Vector Addition Systems (VAS). Within this framework, routing becomes a linear transformation governed by arc mechanisms, while legality is enforced through non-negativity constraints.
  We introduce four routing models -- free routing, standard rotor-routing, cyclic GRM routing, and fully general GRM routing -- and study their reachability problems in both the linear and legal settings. Our results generalize previous characterizations for standard rotor-routing and extend them to the GRM setting. In particular, we show that legal reachability in GRM multigraphs is NP-complete, whereas the cyclic GRM routing model, which includes the classical rotor-router, admits a polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of logical gadgets for 3-coloring under a single anchor constraint, where only one color representing logical falsehood is fixed to a vertex. We introduce a framework of what we call ladgets (logical gadgets), graph gadgets that implement Boolean functions. Then, we define a set of core gadgets, called primitives, which help identify and analyze the logical behavior of ladgets. Next, we examine the structure of several standard ladgets and present several structural constraints for ladgets. Through an exhaustive search of all non-isomorphic connected graphs up to 10 vertices, we verify all minimal constructions for standard ladgets. Notably, we identify exactly two non-isomorphic minimal XNOR ladgets in approximately 29 billion gadget configurations, highlighting the rarity of gadgets capable of expressing logical behavior. We also present an embedding technique that embeds ladgets with less than 3 inputs from 3-coloring into k-coloring. Our work shows how the single anchor constraint creates a fundamentally different framework from the two anchor gadgets used in SAT reductions.</description>

      <title>Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy for many natural Problems in Bilevel and Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bilevel and robust optimization we are concerned with combinatorial min-max problems, for example from the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the classes $\Sigma^p_2$ or $\Sigma^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy, almost no hardness results in this regime are currently known. However, such complexity insights are important, since they imply that no polynomial-sized integer program for these min-max problems exist, and hence conventional IP-based approaches fail. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $\Sigma^p_2$-complete and $\Sigma^p_3$-complete problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $\Sigma^p_2$- and $\Sigma^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Precisely, we introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). We show that for every single of these problems, the corresponding min-max (i.e. interdiction/regret) variant is $\Sigma^p_2$- and the min-max-min (i.e. two-stage) variant is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for Arc-Kayles and Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arc-Kayles is a game where two players alternate removing two adjacent vertices until no move is left, the winner being the player who played the last move. Introduced in 1978, its computational complexity is still open. More recently, subtraction games, where the players cannot disconnect the graph while removing vertices, were introduced. In particular, Arc-Kayles admits a non-disconnecting variant that is a subtraction game. We study the computational complexity of subtraction games on graphs, proving that they are PSPACE-complete even on very structured graph classes (split, bipartite of any even girth). We give a quadratic kernel for Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles when parameterized by the feedback edge number, as well as polynomial-time algorithms for clique trees and a subclass of threshold graphs. We also show that a sufficient condition for a second player-win on Arc-Kayles is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the hard-core model defines a probability distribution over its independent sets, assigning to each set of size $k$ a probability of $\frac{\lambda^k}{Z}$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ is a parameter known as the \emph{fugacity} and $Z$ is a normalization constant. The Glauber dynamics is a simple Markov chain that converges to this distribution and enables efficient sampling. Its \emph{mixing time}, the number of steps needed to approach the stationary distribution, has been widely studied across various graph classes, with most previous work emphasizing the dichotomy between polynomial and exponential mixing times, with a particular focus on sparse classes of graphs. Inspired by the modern fine-grained approach to computational complexity, we investigate subexponential mixing times of the Glauber dynamics on geometric intersection graphs, such as disk graphs. We further study parameterized mixing times with respect to two structural parameters that can remain small even in dense graphs: the tree-independence number and the path-independence number. Building on a result of Dyer, Greenhill, and M\"uller, we show that Glauber dynamics mixes in polynomial time on graphs of bounded path-independence number, and in quasi-polynomial time when the tree-independence number is bounded. Moreover, we prove that both bounds are tight via a conductance argument, thereby resolving a question raised in their work. This work provides a simple and efficient algorithm for sampling from the hard-core model. Unlike classical approaches that rely explicitly on geometric representations or on constructing decompositions such as tree decompositions or separator trees, our analysis only requires their existence to establish mixing time bounds-these structures are not used directly by the algorithm itself.</description>
