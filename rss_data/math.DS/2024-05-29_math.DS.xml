      <title>Gluing-orbit and local stable/unstable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that local stable/unstable sets of homeomorphisms of an infinite compact metric space satisfying the gluing-orbit property always contain compact and perfect subsets of the space. As a consequence, we prove that if a positively countably expansive homeomorphism satisfies the gluing-orbit property, then the space is a single periodic orbit. We also prove that there are homeomorphisms with gluing-orbit such that its induced homeomorphism on the hyperspace of compact subsets does not have gluing-orbit, contrasting with the case of the shadowing and specification properties, proving that if the induced map has gluing-orbit, then the base map has gluing-orbit and is topologically mixing.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic motions in the $N$-body problem with homogeneous potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $N$-body problem, a motion is called hyperbolic, when the mutual distances between the bodies go to infinity with non-zero limiting velocities as time goes to infinity. For Newtonian potential, in \cite{MV20} Maderna and Venturelli proved that starting from any initial position there is a hyperbolic motion with any prescribed limiting velocities at infinity.
  Recently based on a different approach, Liu, Yan and Zhou \cite{LYZ21} generalized this result to a larger class of $N$-body problem. As the proof in \cite{LYZ21} is quite long and technical, we give a simplified proof for homogeneous potentials following the approach given in the latter paper.</description>

      <title>Anderson localized states for the quasi-periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb Z^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish large sets of Anderson localized states for the quasi-periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb Z^d$, thus extending Anderson localization from the linear (cf. Bourgain [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007]) to a nonlinear setting, and the random (cf. Bourgain-Wang [JEMS 10(1), 1--45, 2008]) to a deterministic setting. Among the main ingredients are a new Diophantine estimate of quasi-periodic functions in arbitrarily dimensional phase space, and the application of Bourgain's geometric lemma in [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007].</description>

      <title>Inference for the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model from real action potential data via approximate Bayesian computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process, "recovering" the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.</description>

      <title>An approach to improve agent learning via guaranteeing goal reaching in all episodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Simulation experiments on six problems under five agents, including the benchmarked one, provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>

      <title>Some ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter gave a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem by establishing an ergodic theorem along the number of prime factors of integers. They also showed that this generalization holds as well if the integers are restricted to be squarefree. In this paper, we present the concept of invariant averages under multiplications for arithmetic functions. Utilizing the properties of these invariant averages, we derive several ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers. These theorems have significant connections to the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem, the Bergelson-Richter Theorem, and the Loyd Theorem.</description>

      <title>Mutation-Bias Learning in Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two variants of a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on evolutionary game theoretic considerations. The intentional simplicity of one variant enables us to prove results on its relationship to a system of ordinary differential equations of replicator-mutator dynamics type, allowing us to present proofs on the algorithm's convergence conditions in various settings via its ODE counterpart. The more complicated variant enables comparisons to Q-learning based algorithms. We compare both variants experimentally to WoLF-PHC and frequency-adjusted Q-learning on a range of settings, illustrating cases of increasing dimensionality where our variants preserve convergence in contrast to more complicated algorithms. The availability of analytic results provides a degree of transferability of results as compared to purely empirical case studies, illustrating the general utility of a dynamical systems perspective on multi-agent reinforcement learning when addressing questions of convergence and reliable generalisation.</description>

      <title>Synchronization on circles and spheres with nonlinear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of $n$ points on a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 2$) which attract each other according to a function $\varphi$ of their inner products. When $\varphi$ is linear ($\varphi(t) = t$), the points converge to a common value (i.e., synchronize) in various connectivity scenarios: this is part of classical work on Kuramoto oscillator networks. When $\varphi$ is exponential ($\varphi(t) = e^{\beta t}$), these dynamics correspond to a limit of how idealized transformers process data, as described by Geshkovski et al. (2024). Accordingly, they ask whether synchronization occurs for exponential $\varphi$.
  In the context of consensus for multi-agent control, Markdahl et al. (2018) show that for $d \geq 3$ (spheres), if the interaction graph is connected and $\varphi$ is increasing and convex, then the system synchronizes. What is the situation on circles ($d=2$)? First, we show that $\varphi$ being increasing and convex is no longer sufficient. Then we identify a new condition (that the Taylor coefficients of $\varphi'$ are decreasing) under which we do have synchronization on the circle. In so doing, we provide some answers to the open problems posed by Geshkovski et al. (2024).</description>

Abstract: A monoid $M$ is said to be surjunctive if every injective cellular automaton with finite alphabet over $M$ is surjective. We show that monoid algebras of surjunctive monoids are stably finite. In other words, given any field $K$ and any surjunctive monoid $M$, every one-sided invertible square matrix with entries in the monoid algebra $K[M]$ is two-sided invertible. Our proof uses first-order model theory.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Latch-Mediated Spring Actuation (LaMSA) Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nature, different species of smaller animals produce ultra-fast movements to aid in their locomotion or protect themselves against predators. These ultra-fast impulsive motions are possible, as often times, there exist a small latch in the organism that could hold the potential energy of the system, and once released, generate an impulsive motion. These types of systems are classified as Latch Mediated Spring Actuated (LaMSA) systems, a multi-dimensional, multi-mode hybrid system that switches between a latched and an unlatched state. The LaMSA mechanism has been studied extensively in the field of biology and is observed in a wide range of animal species, such as the mantis shrimp, grasshoppers, and trap-jaw ants. In recent years, research has been done in mathematically modeling the LaMSA behavior with physical implementations of the mechanism. A significant focus is given to mimicking the physiological behavior of the species and following an end-to-end trajectory of impulsive motion. This paper introduces a foundational analysis of the theoretical dynamics of the contact latch-based LaMSA mechanism. The authors answer the question on what makes these small-scale systems impulsive, with a focus on the intrinsic properties of the system using bifurcations. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the saddle fixed points. The authors propose a mathematical explanation for mediating the latch when a saddle node exists, and the impulsive behavior after the bifurcation happens.</description>

Abstract: We establish various analogs of the Kronecker-Weyl equidistribution theorem that can be considered higher-dimensional versions of results established in our earlier investigation of the discrete 2-circle problem studied in 1969 by Veech. Whereas the Veech problem can be viewed as one of geodesic flow on a 2-dimensional flat surface, here we study geodesic flow in higher-dimensional flat manifolds. This is more challenging, as the overwhelming majority of the available proof techniques for non-integrable flat systems are based on arguments in dimension 2. For higher dimensions, we need a new approach.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions for Iterated Graph Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon [1], this study aims to introduce fractal geometry into graph theory, and to establish a potential theoretical foundation for complex networks. Specifically, we employ the method of substitution to create and explore fractal-like graphs, termed deterministic or random iterated graph systems. While the concept of substitution is commonplace in fractal geometry and dynamical systems, its analysis in the context of graph theory remains a nascent field.
  By delving into the properties of these systems, including diameter and distal, we derive two primary outcomes. Firstly, within the deterministic iterated graph systems, we establish that the Minkowski dimension and Hausdorff dimension align analytically through explicit formulae. Secondly, in the case of random iterated graph systems, we demonstrate that almost every graph limit exhibits identical Minkowski and Hausdorff dimensions numerically by their Lyapunov exponents.
  The exploration of iterated graph systems holds the potential to unveil novel directions. These findings not only, mathematically, contribute to our understanding of the interplay between fractals and graphs, but also, physically, suggest promising avenues for applications for complex networks.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamical Hierarchy in Gathering Protocols with Circulant Topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the convergence behavior of gathering protocols with fixed circulant topologies using tools form dynamical systems. Given a fixed number of mobile entities moving in the Euclidean plane, we model a (linear) gathering protocol as a system of (linear) ordinary differential equations whose equilibria are exactly all possible gathering points. Then, for a circulant topology we derive a decomposition of the state space into stable invariant subspaces with different convergence rates by utilizing tools form dynamical systems theory. It turns out, that decomposition is identical for every (linear) circulant gathering protocol, whereas only the convergence rates depend on the weights in interaction graph itself. We end this article with a brief outlook on robots with limited viewing range.</description>

Abstract: The R\"ossler system is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, generating a chaotic attractor which, by the numerical evidence, arises by a period-doubling route to chaos. In this paper we state and prove a topological criterion for the existence of an attractor for the R\"ossler system - and then analyze the dynamics of the non-wandering set by reducing the flow to the dynamics of a well-known one dimensional model: the Quadratic Family, $x^2+c$, $-2\leq c\leq\frac{1}{4}$.</description>

Abstract: We study some new dynamical systems where the corresponding piecewise linear flow is neither time reversible nor measure preserving. We create a dissipative system by starting with a finite polysquare translation surface, and then modifying it by including a one-sided barrier on a common vertical edge of two adjacent atomic squares, in the form of a union of finitely many intervals. The line flow in this system partitions the system into a transient set and a recurrent set. We are interested in the geometry of these two sets.</description>

      <title>Memory in Plain Sight: Surveying the Uncanny Resemblances of Associative Memories and Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative process of Diffusion Models (DMs) has recently set state-of-the-art on many AI generation benchmarks. Though the generative process is traditionally understood as an "iterative denoiser", there is no universally accepted language to describe it. We introduce a novel perspective to describe DMs using the mathematical language of memory retrieval from the field of energy-based Associative Memories (AMs), making efforts to keep our presentation approachable to newcomers to both of these fields. Unifying these two fields provides insight that DMs can be seen as a particular kind of AM where Lyapunov stability guarantees are bypassed by intelligently engineering the dynamics (i.e., the noise and step size schedules) of the denoising process. Finally, we present a growing body of evidence that records DMs exhibiting empirical behavior we would expect from AMs, and conclude by discussing research opportunities that are revealed by understanding DMs as a form of energy-based memory.</description>

      <title>Learning About Structural Errors in Models of Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems are notoriously difficult to model because some degrees of freedom (e.g., small scales) may be computationally unresolvable or are incompletely understood, yet they are dynamically important. For example, the small scales of cloud dynamics and droplet formation are crucial for controlling climate, yet are unresolvable in global climate models. Semi-empirical closure models for the effects of unresolved degrees of freedom often exist and encode important domain-specific knowledge. Building on such closure models and correcting them through learning the structural errors can be an effective way of fusing data with domain knowledge. Here we describe a general approach, principles, and algorithms for learning about structural errors. Key to our approach is to include structural error models inside the models of complex systems, for example, in closure models for unresolved scales. The structural errors then map, usually nonlinearly, to observable data. As a result, however, mismatches between model output and data are only indirectly informative about structural errors, due to a lack of labeled pairs of inputs and outputs of structural error models. Additionally, derivatives of the model may not exist or be readily available. We discuss how structural error models can be learned from indirect data with derivative-free Kalman inversion algorithms and variants, how sparsity constraints enforce a "do no harm" principle, and various ways of modeling structural errors. We also discuss the merits of using non-local and/or stochastic error models. In addition, we demonstrate how data assimilation techniques can assist the learning about structural errors in non-ergodic systems. The concepts and algorithms are illustrated in two numerical examples based on the Lorenz-96 system and a human glucose-insulin model.</description>

Abstract: Edge-based percolation methods can be used to analyze disease transmission on complex social networks. This allows us to include complex social heterogeneity in our models while maintaining tractability. Here we review the seminal works on this field by Newman et al (2001); Newman (2002, 2003), and Miller et al (2012). We present a systematic discussion of the theoretical background behind these models, including an extensive derivation of the major results. We also connect these results relate back to the classical literature in random graph theory Molloy and Reed (1995, 1998). Finally, we also present an accompanying R package that takes epidemic and network parameters as input and generates estimates of the epidemic trajectory and final size. This manuscript and the R package was developed to help researchers easily understand and use network models to investigate the interaction between different community structures and disease transmission.</description>
