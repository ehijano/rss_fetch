      <title>Multi-Messenger Predictions for T Coronae Borealis: Probing Particle Acceleration in Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism --\textit{hadronic} versus \textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Test of Lorentz Invariance with Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral-Lag Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most potent probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), offering direct constraints on the quantum gravity energy scale ($E_{\rm QG}$) based on observations of energy-dependent time lags. Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on $E_{\rm QG}$, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling. Accounting for this uncertainty with cubic spline interpolation, we derive robust limits of $E_{\rm QG,1} \ge 4.37 \times 10^{16}$~GeV for linear LIV and $E_{\rm QG,2} \ge 3.02 \times 10^{8}$~GeV for quadratic LIV. We find that the probability for LIV, i.e., $E_{\rm QG,1}$ being below the Planck scale, is estimated to be around 90\%, which we conclude as no significant evidence for LIV signatures in current GRB spectral lag observations. Our hierarchical approach provides a rigorous statistical framework for future LIV searches and can be extended to incorporate multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Pulsed, Polarized X-ray Emission from Neutron Star Surfaces: the Effects of Vacuum Birefringence in the Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense magnetic fields in the atmospheres of neutron stars render non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of soft X-ray emission originating from their surfaces. By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here can be employed to constrain geometric parameters for various types of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are radio-emitting X-ray binaries accompanied by relativistic jets. They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $&gt;$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $p\gamma$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $\gamma\gamma$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SN 2022acko: a low-luminosity SNe IIP with signs of early circumstellar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical-ultraviolet photometry and optical spectra for the type II supernova (SN) 2022acko. The spectroscopic observations span phases from $\sim$ 1.5 to $\sim$ 60 days after the explosion, while the light curve was observed up to $\sim$ 300 days. The V-band peak is $-15.5 \pm 0.3$ mag, suggesting that SN 2022acko is a low-luminosity SN II (LLSN). The overall observed properties of SN 2022acko are consistent with those produced by a lower mass progenitor ($\rm M_{ZAMS} \sim $9-10M$_{\odot}$). The spectra at $t=1.5$d and $t=2.5$d exhibit a broad emission feature peaking near 4600 \AA (the ``ledge'' feature), which we interpret as blueshifted He II 4686 \AA lines arising from the ionized ejecta. Moreover, a possible flash-ionized (FI) emission line of H$\alpha$ (FWHM $\sim 1100\ \rm km \ s^{-1}$) was superposed on the broad emission component of H$\alpha$ P-Cgyni profile in the $t=1.5$d spectrum. Assuming an ejecta velocity of $\rm 12000\ km\ s^{-1}$, the rapid disappearance of this narrow H$\alpha$ emission line within two days suggests highly confined CSM within $\sim \rm 2\times10^{14}\, cm$. Assuming a spherically symmetric CSM, the mass loss rate within this radius is estimated to be $\rm \sim 5 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \ year^{-1}$ based on our hybrid light curve model. The early ``ledge'' feature observed in SN 2022acko have also been observed in other SNe II, suggesting that early-phase circumstellar interaction (CSI) is more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Cosmic-ray boosted Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Light Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional direct detection experiments lack the sensitivity to probe the sub-GeV dark matter (DM), primarily due to the low energy of the expected nuclear recoils. In this work, we investigate cosmic-ray (CR) upscattering as a mechanism to accelerate DM particles to detectable velocities in underground experiments. By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.</description>

      <title>Kilonova and progenitor properties of merger-driven gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt and afterglow emission, as well as a kilonova (KN), are the expected electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star -- Black Hole (NSBH) mergers. We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\langle M_{\rm wind}\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\langle M_{\rm dyn}\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that $M_{\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\,log(E_{0,J})$. We confirm the results of numerical simulation that $\tilde\Lambda$ increases with decrease in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm \,Chirp}$. Our work shows that EM modeling can be effective for probing the progenitors, and for the first time presents the progenitor properties of a sizable sample of merger-driven GRBs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Reported Period of FRB 20201124A Using MCMC Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients whose physical origin remains uncertain. Magnetar-based models, motivated by observed properties such as polarization and large rotation measures, suggest that FRB emission may be modulated by the magnetar spin period. We present an efficient method to search for periodic signals in repeating FRBs by combining phase folding and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation. Our method accelerates period searches. We test the method using observational data from repeater FRB 20201124A, and show that it can recover reported candidate periods.</description>

      <title>Possibility of Month-scale Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the Gamma-ray Light Curve of OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report evidence suggesting the potential future detection of a month-scale quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the gamma-ray light curve of OP 313. We analysed almost 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and applied the Bayesian block method to the monthly-binned light curve. We identified four high-flux states and investigated the possibility of a QPO in the fourth high-flux state (MJD 59482-60832). Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models. We found that a curved-jet model can explain the observed behaviour.</description>

      <title>Unveiling SN 2022eyw: A Bright Member of the Type Iax Supernova Subclass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova (SN) 2022eyw, a luminous member of the Type Iax SN subclass. SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\pm0.003~\text{M}_{\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\pm0.09~\text{M}_{\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Fermi bubbles and the Galactic center excess with the DArk Matter Particle Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-borne high-energy particle detector that surveys the $\gamma$-ray sky above$\sim 2~\rm GeV$ with a peak acceptance of $\sim 0.2~\rm m^2\,sr$. With the 102 months of data collected by DAMPE, we show that the Fermi bubbles are detected at a significance of $\sim 26\sigma$ and identify a GeV excess in the direction of Galactic center at $\sim 7 \sigma$ confidence. Both spectra and morphology are consistent with those observed by Fermi-LAT and the GeV excess component can be interpreted by the dark matter annihilation with a mass of $\sim 50$ GeV and a velocity-averaged cross section of $\sim 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^{3}~s^{-1}}$ for the $\chi \chi \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ channel. Our results thus provide the first independent detection of these two intriguing diffuse gamma-ray sources besides Fermi-LAT.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\rm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\mathrm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\text{NS}}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_{\chi}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\% confidence level, $M_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\ M_{\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Classification and Characteristics of Double-trigger Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($\tau_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</description>

      <title>On the origin and nature of double-double radio galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) display inner and outer jets or lobes thought to result from intermittent accretion. Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interplays Between $^3\text{P}_2$ Neutron Superfluid Vortices and $^1\text{S}_0$ Proton Fluxtubes in the Outer Core of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the outer core of neutron stars, $^3$P$_2$ superfluid neutrons and $^1$S$_0$ superconducting protons are deemed to exist, forming quantum vortices and magnetic fluxtubes, respectively. Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detectability of continuous gravitational waves from the near future to next generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves have the potential to transform gravitational wave astronomy and yield fresh insights into astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed matter physics. We evaluate their detectability by combining various theoretical and observational arguments from the literature and systematically applying those arguments to known astronomical objects and future gravitational wave detectors. We detail and update previous estimates made in support of Cosmic Explorer [M. Evans et al., arXiv:2306.13745; I. Gupta et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 41, 245001 (2024)]. It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Multimessenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves and future detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first physics-informed neural-network (PINN) surrogates for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) using a hybrid PDE and data-driven workflow. Instead of training for the conservative form of the equations, we work with Jacobians or PDE characteristics directly in terms of primitive variables. We further add to the trainable system the divergence-free condition, without the need of cleaning modes. Using a novel MUON optimizer implementation, we show that a baseline PINN trained on early-time snapshots can extrapolate RMHD dynamics in one and two spatial dimensions, and that posterior residual-guided networks can systematically reduce PDE violations.</description>

      <title>Three channel dissipative warm Higgs inflation with global inference via genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs and analyzes a three channel dissipative framework for Warm Higgs Inflation, wherein the total dissipation coefficient, $\Upsilon(h,T)$, is decomposed into low temperature, high temperature, and threshold activated contributions. A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \equiv \Upsilon/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\texttt{noprior} vs. \texttt{mixing} vs. \texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r &lt; 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively. A typical best fit solution exhibits a "channel relay" dynamical feature during its evolution and a genuinely mixed state at the pivot scale (e.g., $f_{{\rm HT},*}\simeq 0.399480$, $f_{{\rm th},*}\simeq 0.600517$), implying that the microscopic origin of dissipation need not be unique within a single inflationary history.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Equation of State with Nucleon Short-Range Correlations: A Concise Review and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and the associated high-momentum tail (HMT) in its momentum distribution $n(k)$ represent a universal feature of strongly interacting Fermi systems. In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter.</description>

      <title>Compact star and compact star matter properties from a baryonic extended linear sigma model with explicit chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a baryonic extended linear sigma model including explicit chiral symmetry breaking effect, the structure of neutron star with the emergence of hyperons is investigated using the relativistic mean field approximation. It's found that, except the lightest scalar meson $\sigma$ whose structure is not well understood so far, the vacuum mass spectra of relevant hadrons and NM properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Nevertheless, we found that, to have a realistic mass-radius relation of neutron stars, the $\pi N$ sigma term $\sigma_{\pi N}$, which denotes the contribution of explicit symmetry breaking, should deviate from its empirical values at vacuum. Specifically, $\sigma_{\pi N}\sim -600$ MeV, rather than $(32-89) \rm \ MeV$ at vacuum. With an appropriate choice of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ and $K(n_0)$, our framework can give a more data favored mass-radius relation of neutron stars with the emergence of hyperons. The effect of explicit symmetry breaking at densities is hoped to provide a new insight to the relation between microscopic symmetries in medium and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Frozen Neutron Stars in Four-Dimensional Non-polynomial Gravities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure and properties of neutron stars in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $\alpha$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $\alpha$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.</description>

Abstract: We review our current knowledge of thermal and viscous instabilities in accretion discs around compact objects. We begin with classical disc models based on analytic viscosity prescriptions, discussing physical uncertainties and exploring time-dependent solutions of disc evolution. We also review the ionization instability responsible for outbursting dwarf nova and X-ray binary systems, including some detailed comparisons between alpha-based models and the observed characteristics of these systems. We then review modern theoretical work based on ideas around angular momentum transport mediated by magnetic fields, focusing in particular on knowledge gained through local and global computer simulations of MHD processes in discs. We discuss how magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) may alter our understanding of outbursts in white dwarf and X-ray binary systems. Finally, we turn to the putative thermal/viscous instabilities that were predicted to exist in the inner, radiation pressure-dominated regions of black hole and neutron star discs, in apparent contradiction to the observed stability of the high/soft state in black hole X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB 20240114A exhibited an exceptionally high burst rate, revealing unique properties. Through observational campaigns over several months, we selected a dataset comprising 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) during a continuous monitoring session (15,780 seconds) on March 12, 2024. Improving upon previous work, we clarify the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measures (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, we classified the burst-clusters into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex burst-clusters. Among the 978 burst-clusters that exhibit drifting behavior, 233 (23.82%) show upward drifting. Additionally, if 142 upward drifting single-component burst-clusters are excluded, upward drifting double- and multi-component burst-clusters still account for 10.89% of the 836 burst-clusters exhibiting drifting behavior, equating to 91 burst-clusters. Furthermore, if only upward drifting burst-clusters with consecutive time intervals (or upward drifting bursts) are considered, only 9 bursts remain. Drifting rate comparisons with other physical quantities reveal that the drifting rate increases with peak frequency for single-component burst-clusters with drifting behavior. Moreover, in single-component burst-clusters, those with upward drifting exhibit smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than their downward drifting counterparts. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test further indicates that upward drifting burst-clusters possess longer consecutive time intervals than downward drifting ones, suggesting distinct underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cooling of dark neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</description>

      <title>Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ after 11 years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed ~45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>

      <title>Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from non-rotating very massive stars (VMSs, $&gt;100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z&gt;0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z&lt;0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.</description>

      <title>Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</description>

      <title>A Search for Hard X-ray/Soft $\gamma$-ray Emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the hard X-ray to soft $\gamma$-ray regime. We searched for emission in the 30--300~keV energy range using the INTEGRAL Off-line scientific analysis software with a total effective exposure of 2817 s. No significant emission was detected at the cluster position in the aforementioned energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-100\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 4.4 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $\gamma$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary. The $\gamma$-ray signal was detected with a statistical significance of approximately 10 $\sigma$ by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Its intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), extending from 0.06 to 3.7 PeV, shows a pronounced rise toward 1 PeV after accounting for absorption by the cosmic microwave background radiation. The detected month-scale variability,together with a 3.2$\sigma$ evidence for orbital modulation, suggests that the PeV $\gamma$-rays originate within, or in close proximity to, the binary system itself. The observed energy spectrum and temporal modulation can be naturally explained by $\gamma$-ray production through photomeson processes in the innermost region of the relativistic jet, where protons need to be accelerated to tens of PeV energies.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no strong evidence for an extra mode; however, its inclusion modifies the inferred distribution of the remnant spin. This test will be applicable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.02 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.003 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes.</description>

      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the ``effective mass" from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole. Earlier studies treated the problem in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, yielding qualitatively correct results and introducing a light cylinder (LC), a hypothetical surface where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light. However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder. We then determine the maximum energies attainable by the electrons under the limiting effects of inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and synchrotron radiation.</description>
