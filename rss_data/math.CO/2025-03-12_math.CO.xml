      <title>Ghost Kohnert posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Pan and Yu showed that Lascoux polynomials can be defined in terms of certain collections of diagrams consisting of unit cells arranged in the first quadrant. Starting from certain initial diagrams, one forms a finite set of diagrams by applying two types of moves: Kohnert and ghost moves. Both moves cause at most one cell to move to a lower row with ghost moves leaving a new "ghost cell" in its place. Each diagram formed in this way defines a monomial in the associated Lascoux polynomial. Restricting attention to diagrams formed by applying sequences of only Kohnert moves in the definition of Lascoux polynomials, one obtains the family of key polynomials. Recent articles have considered a poset structure on the collections of diagrams formed when one uses only Kohnert moves. In general, these posets are not "well-behaved," not usually having desirable poset properties. Here, as an intermediate step to studying the analogous posets associated with Lascoux polynomials, we consider the posets formed by restricting attention to those diagrams formed by using only ghost moves. Unlike in the case of Kohnert posets, we show that such "ghost Kohnert posets" are always ranked join semi-lattices. In addition, we establish a necessary condition for when ghost Kohnert posets are bounded and, consequently, lattices.</description>

      <title>Brewing Fubini-Bruhat Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bruhat order on permutations arises out of the study of Schubert varieties in Grassmannians and flag varieties, which have been important for over 100 years. The purpose of this paper is to study variations on this theme related to subvarieties of the spanning line configurations $X_{n,k}$ as defined by Pawlowski and Rhoades. These subvarieties are indexed by Fubini words, or equivalently by ordered set partitions. Three natural partial orders arise in this context; we refer to them as the decaf, medium roast, and espresso orders. The decaf order is a generalization of the weak order on permutations defined by covering relations using simple transpositions. The medium roast order is a generalization of the (strong) Bruhat order defined by the closure relationship on the subvarieties. The espresso order is the transitive closure of a relation based on intersecting subvarieties. Many properties of Schubert varieties and Bruhat order extend to one or more of the three Fubini-Bruhat orders. We examine some of the many possibilities in this work.</description>

      <title>List rainbow connection number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-coloured path is rainbow if all of its edges have distinct colours. Let $G$ be a connected graph. The rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by $rc(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in an edge-colouring of $G$ such that, any two vertices are connected by a rainbow path. The strong rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by $src(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in an edge-colouring of $G$ such that, any two vertices are connected by a rainbow geodesic (i.e., a path of shortest length). These two notions of connectivity of graphs were introduced by Chartrand, Johns, McKeon and Zhang in 2008. In this paper, we introduce the list rainbow connection number $rc^\ell(G)$, and the list strong rainbow connection number $src^\ell(G)$. These two parameters are the versions of $rc(G)$ and $src(G)$ that involve list edge-colourings. Among our results, we will determine the list rainbow connection number and list strong rainbow connection number of some specific graphs. We will also characterise all pairs of positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that, there exists a connected graph $G$ with $src(G)=a$ and $src^\ell(G)=b$, and similarly for the pair $rc^\ell$ and $src^\ell$. Finally, we propose the question of whether or not we have $rc(G)=rc^\ell(G)$, for all connected graphs $G$.</description>

      <title>Bounding the SNPR distance between two tree-child networks using generalised agreement forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agreement forests continue to play a central role in the comparison of phylogenetic trees since their introduction more than 25 years ago. More specifically, they are used to characterise several distances that are based on tree rearrangement operations and related quantifiers of dissimilarity between phylogenetic trees. In addition, the concept of agreement forests continues to underlie most advancements in the development of algorithms that exactly compute the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we introduce agreement digraphs, a concept that generalises agreement forests for two phylogenetic trees to two phylogenetic networks. Analogous to the way in which agreement forests compute the subtree prune and regraft distance between two phylogenetic trees but inherently more complex, we then use agreement digraphs to bound the subnet prune and regraft distance between two tree-child networks from above and below and show that our bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Shortest Circuits in Homology Classes of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study of circuits and cycles within the homology classes of graphs has attracted considerable research interest. However, the detection and counting of shorter circuits in homology classes, especially the shortest ones, remain underexplored. This paper aims to fill this gap by solving the problem of detecting and counting the shortest cycles in homology classes, leveraging the concept of direction-consistent circuits and extending classical results on Eulerian circuits such as Hierholzer's algorithm and the BEST theorem. As an application, we propose the one-carrier transportation routing problem and relate it to a circuit detection problem in graph homology.</description>

      <title>On restricted sumsets with bounded degree relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a relation $\mathcal{R}$ on $A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$.
  We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, provided that $p &gt; p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set.
  In addition, we contruct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier example by Lev and hightlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Face covers and rooted minors in bounded genus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em rooted graph} is a graph together with a designated vertex subset, called the {\em roots}. In this paper, we consider rooted graphs embedded in a fixed surface. A collection of faces of the embedding is a {\em face cover} if every root is incident to some face in the collection. We prove that every $3$-connected, rooted graph that has no rooted $K_{2,t}$ minor and is embedded in a surface of Euler genus $g$, has a face cover whose size is upper-bounded by some function of $g$ and $t$, provided that the face-width of the embedding is large enough in terms of $g$. In the planar case, we prove an unconditional $O(t^4)$ upper bound, improving a result of B\"ohme and Mohar~\cite{BM02}. The higher genus case was claimed without a proof by B\"ohme, Kawarabayashi, Maharry and Mohar~\cite{BKMM08}.</description>

      <title>Vertex models for the product of a permuted-basement Demazure atom and a Schur polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first positive combinatorial rule for expanding the product of a permuted-basement Demazure atom and a Schur polynomial. Special cases of permuted-basement Demazure atoms include Demazure atoms and characters. These cases have known tableau formulas for their expansions when multiplied by a Schur polynomial, due to Haglund, Luoto, Mason and van Willigenburg. We find a vertex model formula, giving a new rule even in these special cases, extending a technique introduced by Zinn-Justin for calculating Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
  We derive a coloured vertex model for permuted-basement Demazure atoms, inspired by Borodin and Wheeler's model for non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. We make this model compatible with an uncoloured vertex model for Schur polynomials, putting them in a single framework. While previous work on structure coefficients via vertex models relies on solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, a remarkable feature of our construction is that the Yang-Baxter equation does not hold; we derive a weaker analogue that is sufficient to show our result.</description>

Abstract: Shi, Walsh and Yu demonstrated that any dense circuit graph contains a large near-triangulation. We extend the result to $2$-connected plane graphs, thereby addressing a question posed by them. Using the result, we prove that the planar Tu\'{a}n number of $2C_k$ is $\left[3-\Theta(k^{\log_23})^{-1}\right]n$ when $k\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Strongly chordal graphs as intersection graphs of trees (Farber's proof revisited)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his Ph.D. thesis, Farber proved that every strongly chordal graph can be represented as intersection graph of subtrees of a weighted tree, and these subtrees are ``compatible''. Moreover, this is an equivalent characterization of strongly chordal graphs. To my knowledge, Farber never published his results in a conference or a journal, and the thesis is not available electronically. As a service to the community, I therefore reproduce the proof here.
  I then answer some questions that naturally arise from the proof. In particular, the sufficiency proof works by showing the existence of a simple vertex. I give here an alternate sufficiency proof that directly converts a set of compatible subtrees into a strong elimination order.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions and independent sets in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: for what values of $k&gt;d/2$ does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)?
  Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proposed the following conjecture. It is easy to see that a $k$-star decomposition necessitates the existence of an independent set of density $1-d/(2k)$. So let $k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$ be the largest $k$ for which the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s.~contains an independent set of this density. Clearly, $k$-star decompositions cannot exist for $k&gt;k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. The conjecture suggests that this is essentially the only restriction: there is a threshold $k^\star_d$ such that $k$-star decompositions exist if and only if $k \leq k^\star_d$, and it (basically) coincides with the other threshold, i.e., $k^\star_d \approx k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$.
  We confirm this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$ by showing that a $k$-star decomposition exists if $d/2&lt; k &lt; k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. In fact, we even prove the existence of a $k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$-star decomposition for degrees $d$ with asymptotic density $1$.</description>

      <title>A quantitative way to e-positivity of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1997, Wolfgang proved that every connected graph having $e$-positive chromatic symmetric function must contain connected partitions of every type. In this paper, we refine this result by a quantitative way in the special case of trees. At first, we give a formula for calculating $e$-coefficients of trees in terms of their connected partitions. Based on this formula, we present several necessary conditions on the number of connected partitions or acyclic orientations for trees to be $e$-positive. As an application, we prove the non-$e$-positivity of a class of caterpillars which have connected partitions of all type. Moreover, we give a necessary condition for caterpillars to be $e$-positive, which may be applied to provide more evidence to the conjecture of Dahlberg, She, and van Willigenburg that every tree of maximum degree at least 4 is non-$e$-positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of continuous piecewise affine (CPA) functions can be measured by the number of pieces $p$ or the number of distinct affine functions $n$. For CPA functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, this paper shows an upper bound of $p=O(n^{d+1})$ and constructs a family of functions achieving a lower bound of $p=\Omega(n^{d+1-\frac{c}{\sqrt{\log_2(n)}}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stratifications of regions in the space of symmetric matrices. Their points are Mandelstam matrices for momentum vectors in particle physics. Kinematic strata in these regions are indexed by signs and rank two matroids. Matroid strata of Lorentzian quadratic forms arise when all signs are non-negative. We characterize the posets of strata, for massless and massive particles, with and without momentum conservation.</description>

Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game played on a graph in which we place and disperse chips on vertices until a stable configuration is reached. We study a chip-firing variant played on an infinite rooted directed $k$-ary tree, where we place $k^n$ chips labeled $0,1,\dots, k^n-1$ on the root for some nonnegative integer $n$, and we say a vertex $v$ can fire if it has at least $k$ chips. A vertex fires by dispersing one chip to each out-neighbor. Once every vertex has less than $k$ chips, we reach a stable configuration since no vertex can fire. In this paper, we focus on stable configurations resulting from applying a strategy $F_w$ corresponding to a permutation $w = w_1w_2\dots w_n\in S_n$: for each vertex $v$ on level $i$ of the $k$-ary tree, the chip with $j$ as its $w_i$th most significant digit in the $k$-ary expansion gets sent to the $(j+1)$st child of $v$. We express the stable configuration as a permutation, and we explore the properties of these permutations, such as the number of inversions, descents, and the descent set.</description>

      <title>Edge isoperimetry of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two results related to an edge-isoperimetric question for Cayley graphs on the integer lattice asked by Ben Barber and Joshua Erde [Isoperimetry of Integer Lattices, Discrete Analysis 7 (2018)]. For any (undirected) graph $G$, the edge boundary of a subset of vertices $S$ is the number of edges between $S$ and its complement in $G$. Barber and Erde asked whether for any Cayley graph on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, there is always an ordering of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ such that for each $n$, the first $n$ terms minimize the edge boundary among all subsets of size $n$.
  First, we present an example of a Cayley graph $G_d$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for all $d\geq 2$) for which there is no such ordering. Furthermore, we show that for all $n$ and any optimal $n$-vertex subset $S_n$ of $G_d$, there is no infinite sequence $S_n\subset S_{n+1}\subset S_{n+2}\subset\cdots$ of optimal sets $S_i$, where $|S_i|=i$ for $i\geq n$. This is to be contrasted with the positive result in $\mathbb{Z}^1$ shown by Joseph Briggs and Chris Wells [arXiv:2402.14087].
  Our second result is a positive example for the unit-length triangular lattice (which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^2$) where two vertices are connected by an edge if their distance is $1$ or $\sqrt{3}$. We show that this graph has such an ordering. This is the most complicated example known to us of a two-dimensional Cayley graph for which an ordering exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture and show that there are precisely $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral $E_7$-friezes and $E_8$-friezes respectively, completing the enumerative classification of all positive integral friezes of Dynkin type. In general, we count positive integral friezes of rank $n$ by determining the positive integral points on a $n$-dimensional singular affine variety. This gives new Diophantine proofs of the enumeration theorems for friezes of the other Dynkin types, which were previously proved using discrete geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer in the negative the long-standing open question of whether biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence for germs of real algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb C^n$. More precisely we give an example of two germs of real algebraic surfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ that are biholomorphic, but not via an algebraic biholomorphism. In fact we even prove that the components of any biholomorphism between these two surfaces are never solutions of polynomial differential equations. The proof is based on enumerative combinatorics and differential Galois Theory results concerning the nature of the generating series of walks restricted to the quarter plane.</description>

Abstract: We prove a quasi-linear upper bound on the size of $K_{t,t}$-free polygon visibility graphs. For visibility graphs of star-shaped and monotone polygons we show a linear bound. In the more general setting of $n$ points on a simple closed curve and visibility pseudo-segments, we provide an $O(n \log n)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(n\alpha(n))$ lower bound.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refined algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by finitely many non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossing. We are interested in shapes of such regions with surrounding real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs the regions naturally collapse to respecting the projection to a straight line. Such graphs were first formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020, and regions surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves were mainly considered. The author has generalized the studies to several general situations.
  We find classes of such objects defined inductively by adding curves. We respect characteristic finite sets in the curves. We consider regions surrounded by the curves and of a new type. We investigate geometric properties and combinatorial ones of them and discuss important examples. We also previously studied explicit classes defined inductively in this way and review them.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of Ramsey partition regularity, a generalisation of partition regularity involving infinitary configurations. We provide characterisations of this notion in terms of certain ultrafilters related to tensor products and dubbed Ramsey's witnesses; and we also consider their nonstandard counterparts as pairs of hypernatural numbers, called Ramsey pairs. These characterisations are then used to determine whether various configurations involving polynomials and exponentials are Ramsey partition regular over the natural numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda &gt; 1$. While $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda = 1$ have been studied in numerous papers, this is the first detailed treatment for $\lambda &gt; 1$. We establish fundamental properties of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and introduce the notion of equivalence. We prove various necessary conditions of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, including upper bounds on $\lambda$. We present three constructions of infinite families of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, highlighting the characterization of two subfamilies of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations. We discuss a computational approach to $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and tabulate computational results for abelian groups of small order.</description>

Abstract: For a given graph $G$, Budzik, Gaiotto, Kulp, Wang, Williams, Wu, Yu, and the first author studied a ''topological'' differential form $\alpha_G$, which expresses violations of BRST-closedness of a quantum field theory along a single topological direction. In a seemingly unrelated context, Brown, Panzer, and the second author studied a ''Pfaffian'' differential form $\phi_G$, which is used to construct cohomology classes of the odd commutative graph complex. We give an explicit combinatorial proof that $\alpha_G$ coincides with $\phi_G$. We also discuss the equivalence of several properties of these forms, which had been established independently for both contexts in previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.11313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lov\'asz (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of all graphs, i.e. for every graph $F$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Recently, homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted classes of graphs such as bounded treewidth, bounded treedepth and planar graphs, has emerged as a surprisingly powerful framework for capturing diverse equivalence relations on graphs arising from logical equivalence and algebraic equation systems.
  In this paper, we provide a unified algebraic framework for such results by examining the linear-algebraic and representation-theoretic structure of tensors counting homomorphisms from labelled graphs. The existence of certain linear transformations between such homomorphism tensor subspaces can be interpreted both as homomorphism indistinguishability over a graph class and as feasibility of an equational system. Following this framework, we obtain characterisations of homomorphism indistinguishability over several natural graph classes, namely trees of bounded degree and graphs of bounded pathwidth, answering a question of Dell et al. (2018), and graphs of bounded treedepth.</description>

Abstract: We show that every commutative idempotent monoid (a.k.a lattice) is the endomorphism monoid of a subcubic graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb.~Theory, Ser.~B, 1980] and the degree bound is best-possible. On the other hand, we show that no class excluding a minor can have all commutative idempotent monoids among its endomorphism monoids. As a by-product we prove that monoids can be represented by graphs of bounded expansion (reproving a result of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez) and $k$-cancellative monoids can be represented by graphs of bounded degree. Finally, we show that not all completely regular monoids can be represented by graphs excluding topological minor (strengthening a result of Babai and Pultr).</description>

      <title>Consistent Dimer Models on Surfaces with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dimer model is a quiver with faces embedded in a surface. We define and investigate notions of consistency for dimer models on general surfaces with boundary which restrict to well-studied consistency conditions in the disk and torus case. We define weak consistency in terms of the associated dimer algebra and show that it is equivalent to the absence of bad configurations on the strand diagram. In the disk and torus case, weakly consistent models are nondegenerate, meaning that every arrow is contained in a perfect matching; this is not true for general surfaces. Strong consistency is defined to require weak consistency as well as nondegeneracy. We prove that the completed as well as the noncompleted dimer algebra of a strongly consistent dimer model are bimodule internally 3-Calabi-Yau with respect to their boundary idempotents. As a consequence, the Gorenstein-projective module category of the completed boundary algebra of suitable dimer models categorifies the cluster algebra given by their underlying quiver. We provide additional consequences of weak and strong consistency, including that one may reduce a strongly consistent dimer model by removing digons and that consistency behaves well under taking dimer submodels.</description>

      <title>List colorings of $k$-partite $k$-graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform hypergraph (or $k$-graph) $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that each edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. In this note, we consider list colorings for such hypergraphs. We show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ if each vertex $v \in V(H)$ is assigned a list of size $|L(v)| \geq \left((k-1+\varepsilon)\Delta/\log \Delta\right)^{1/(k-1)}$, then $H$ admits a proper $L$-coloring, provided $\Delta$ is sufficiently large. Up to a constant factor, this matches the bound on the chromatic number of simple $k$-graphs shown by Frieze and Mubayi, and that on the list chromatic number of triangle free $k$-graphs shown by Li and Postle. Our results hold in the more general setting of ``color-degree'' as has been considered for graphs. Furthermore, we establish a number of asymmetric statements matching results of Alon, Cambie, and Kang for bipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making use of a newly developed package in the computer mathematics system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis of certain types of sums that occur frequently in combinatorics, including explicit error bounds. We present two applications of the general approach to illustrate its use: the first concerns a classical problem due to Ramanujan, while the second one concerns a question of B\'ona and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.</description>

      <title>Modular Forms in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular symmetries hidden in the combinatorial optimization framework remain mostly unexplored which has hindered any significant improvement in the solution quality. To unveil the modular structure, we map the cost and decision variables into complex domain and develop a novel framework for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). The transformed formulation is proven to be translation and inversion invariant, thereby allowing us to establish that achieving global optimum is equivalent to an infinite number of moment cancellations for each arc. The underlying idea is to achieve a delicate balance between cost and decision variables, expressed mathematically as an equilibrium condition, that allows for very strong modular symmetry to hold. The infinite moment cancellation is proven to be both necessary and sufficient condition for global optimality. In fact, we show that for strongly modular case, the rapid decay of moment contributions shall lead to series truncation with controllable error, allowing for efficient approximations. In contrast, weak modularity retains residual error thereby, reinforcing NP-hardness. These insights can inform the development of sophisticated algorithms that improve the quality of solutions.</description>

      <title>Distribution of hooks in self-conjugate partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>

Abstract: What spectral conditions imply a graph contains a chorded cycle? This question was asked by R.J. Gould in 2022. We answer two modified versions of Gould's question by giving tight spectral conditions that imply the existence of doubly chorded cycle, and a doubly chorded cycle with two chords incident to a vertex, respectively.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the Redei-Berge function and related combinatorial Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stanley and Grinberg introduced the symmetric function associated to digraphs, called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. In [8] is shown that this symmetric function arises from a suitable structure of combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs. In this paper, we introduce two new combinatorial Hopf algebras of posets and permutations and define corresponding Redei-Berge functions for them. By using both theories, of symmetric functions and of combinatorial Hopf algebras, we prove many properties of the Redei-Berge function. These include some forms of deletion-contraction property, which make it similar to the chromatic symmetric function. We also find some invariants of digraphs that are detected by the Redei-Berge function.</description>

      <title>Antimagic labellings of (k, 2)-bipartite biregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An antimagic labelling of a graph is a bijection from the set of edges to $\{1, 2, \ldots , m\}$, such that all vertex-sums are pairwise distinct, where the vertex-sum of a vertex is the sum of labels on the edges incident to it. We say a graph is antimagic if it has an antimagic labelling. In 2023, it has been proven that connected $(k, l)$-bipartite graphs are antimagic if $k \geq l + 2$ and one of k or l is odd. In this paper, we extend this result to connected $(k, 2)$-bipartite biregular graphs for $k \geq 4$ even, and to $(k, 2)$-bipartite biregular graphs for $k \geq 3$ odd.</description>

      <title>The Closed Geodetic Game: algorithms and strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodetic closure of a set S of vertices of a graph is the set of all vertices in shortest paths between pairs of vertices of S. A set S of vertices in a graph is geodetic if its geodetic closure contains all the vertices of the graph. Buckley introduced in 1984 the idea of a game where two players construct together a geodetic set by alternately selecting vertices, the game ending when all vertices are in the geodetic closure. The Geodetic Game was then studied in 1985 by Buckley and Harary, and allowed players to select vertices already in the geodetic closure of the current set. We study the more natural variant, also introduced in 1985 by Buckley and Harary and called the Closed Geodetic Game, where the players alternate adding to a set S vertices that are not in the geodetic closure of S, until no move is available. This variant was only studied ever since for trees by Araujo et al. in 2024. We provide a full characterization of the Sprague-Grundy values of graph classes such as paths and cycles, of the outcomes of the Cartesian product of several graphs in function of their individual outcomes, and give polynomial-time algorithms to determine the Sprague-Grundy values of cactus and block graphs.</description>

      <title>VC-dimensions for set familes between partially ordered set and totally ordered set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that two partial orders on $[n]$ are compatible if there exists a partial order that is finer than both of them. Under this compatibility relation, the set of all partial orders $\mathcal{F}$ and the set of all total orders $\mathcal{G}$ on $[n]$ naturally define set families on each other, where each order is identified with the set of orders that are compatible with it.
  In this note, we determine the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{G}$ by showing that $\operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{G}}(\mathcal{F}) = \lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$ for $n \ge 4$. We also prove $2(n-3) \le \operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{G}) \le n \log_2 n$ for $n \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980, Gupta, Kahn and Robertson proved that every graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k\geq 2$ contains a cycle $C$ containing at least $k+1$ vertices each having at least $k$ neighbors in $C$ (so $C$ has at least $\frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{2}$ chords). In this work, we go further by showing that some of its edges can be contracted to obtain a graph with high minimum degree (we call such a minor of $C$ a \emph{cyclic minor}). We then investigate further cycles having cliques as cyclic minors, and show that minimum degree at least $O(k^2)$ guarantees a cyclic $K_k$-minor.</description>

      <title>Multi-parametric matroids -- Applications to interdiction and weight set decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the multi-parametric matroid problem. The weights of the elements of the matroid's ground set depend linearly on an arbitrary but fixed number of parameters, each of which is taken from a real interval. The goal is to compute a minimum weight basis for each possible combination of the parameters. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that requires a polynomial number of independence tests and discuss two useful applications. First, the algorithm can be applied to solve a multi-parametric version of a special matroid interdiction problem, and second, it can be utilized to compute the weight set decomposition of the multi-objective (graphic) matroid problem. For the latter, we asymptotically improve the current state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor that is almost proportional to the number of edges of the graphic matroid.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>Multiple typical ranks in matrix completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion addresses the problem of completing a matrix from a certain set of generic specified entries. Over the complex numbers a matrix with a given entry pattern can be uniquely completed to a specific rank, called the generic completion rank. Completions over the reals may generically have multiple completion ranks, called typical ranks. We demonstrate techniques for proving that many sets of specified entries have only one typical rank, and show other families with two typical ranks, specifically focusing on entry sets represented by circulant graphs. This generalizes the results of Bernstein, Blekherman, and Sinn. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of the set of unspecified entries of an $n\times n$ matrix such that $n-1$ is a typical rank and fully determine the typical ranks for entry set $G(n,1)$ for $n&lt;9$. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behaviour of typical ranks and present results regarding unique matrix completions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra of functions on the Iwahori group via the category of graded bounded representations of its Lie algebra. In particular, we identify the standard and costandard objects in this category with certain generalized Weyl modules. Using this identification we express the characters of the standard and costandard objects in terms of specialized nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. We also prove that our category of interest admits a generalized highest weight structure (known as stratified structure). We show, more generally, that such a structure on a category of representations of a Lie algebra implies the Peter-Weyl type theorem for the corresponding algebraic group. In the Iwahori case, standard filtrations of indecomposable projective objects correspond to new ``reciprocal'' Macdonald-type identities.</description>

      <title>The largest subcritical component in inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential attachment type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the size of the largest connected component in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The component is polynomial in the graph size with an explicitly given exponent, which is strictly larger than the exponent for the largest degree in the graph. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of inhomogeneous random graphs with a kernel of rank one. Our proof uses local approximation by branching random walks going well beyond the weak local limit and novel results on subcritical killed branching random walks.</description>
