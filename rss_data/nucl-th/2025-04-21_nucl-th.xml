      <title>Refinement of an analytical capture cross section formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical formula with high accuracy is proposed for a systematic description of the capture cross sections from light to superheavy reaction systems. Based on the empirical barrier distribution (EBD) method, three key input quantities are refined by introducing the Coulomb exchange term to the Coulomb parameter $z$ for calculating the barrier height, incorporating the $Q$-value into the barrier distribution width calculations, and considering the surface effects of light nuclei and the deep inelastic scattering effects of superheavy systems on the barrier radius. These refinements substantially improve the model accuracy, not only the accuracy of the barrier height but also the accruacy of the capture cross sections at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The mean value of the deviations (in logarithmic scale) between the predicted cross sections and the data for a total of 426 reaction systems with $ 35 &lt; Z_1 Z_2 &lt; 2600$ is sharply reduced from 3.485 to 0.166.</description>

      <title>Charge radii and their deformation correlation for even-$Z$ nuclei in deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematics are investigated for the charge radii of the even-$Z$ nuclei with $8 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$ calculated by the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the functional PC-PK1, and their deformation correlation is explored. The available data of the charge radius are reproduced with a root-mean-square deviation $\sigma=0.033$ fm. In particular, for the nuclei between the closed shells, the descriptions of the charge radii are remarkably improved by including the deformation. Taking molybdenum isotopes as examples, both the evolutions of the charge radius and deformation are well reproduced. It is found that while the charge radius typically increases with the deformation, there also exist different cases. For example, in $^{346}$Sg, the charge radius of the deformed ground state is smaller than the one of the spherical state, and the largest binding energy does not necessarily correspond to the smallest charge radius.</description>

      <title>Productions of $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in different coalescence channels in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the productions of $\Lambda$-hypernuclei $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in the coalescence mechanism in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV. Considering the abundance and great importance of baryons and light (hyper-)nuclei on the collision dynamics, we include not only nucleon$+\Lambda$ coalescence but also nucleus+nucleon($\Lambda$) coalescence. We present contributions from different coalescence channels for $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in their productions. We predict the production asymmetry between $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He, characterized by yield ratios $^4_{\Lambda}\text{He}/^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $(^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}-^4_{\Lambda}\text{He})/(^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}+^4_{\Lambda}\text{He})$, which can shed light on the existence constraints of the possible neutron-$\Lambda$ bound states $^2_{\Lambda}n~(n\Lambda)$ and $^3_{\Lambda}n~(nn\Lambda)$.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>

      <title>The impact of new ($\alpha$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars.</description>

      <title>Extracting the chiral anomaly from $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction of three pions and a photon, $F_{3\pi}$ is predicted by the axial anomaly in terms of the pion decay constant, a relation that is frequently used to constrain low-energy radiative processes involving pions, but only tested experimentally at the $10\%$ level. Here, we present a new avenue to test this prediction, via a fit of a dispersive description of the $\gamma^*\to3\pi$ amplitude to data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$. From the global fit to SND, CMD-2, and BaBar data we obtain $F_{3\pi}=33.1(1.7)\,\text{GeV}^{-3}$, in agreement with the chiral prediction at the level of $5\%$. We also consider dispersive fits to the recent data by Belle II, in which case we observe tensions with the dispersive constraints, the width parameters of $\omega$ and $\phi$, and the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Charge symmetry breaking in hypernuclei within RMF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) effect in the binding energy of mirror hypernuclei in the mass region $A=7\sim 48$ in relativistic mean field (RMF) models introducing $NN$ and $\Lambda N$ interactions. The phenomenological $\Lambda N$ CSB interaction is introduced and the strength parameter is fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energy difference between the mirror hypernuclei $^{12}_\Lambda$B and $^{12}_\Lambda$C. This model is applied to calculate the CSB energy anomaly in mirror hypernuclei with the mass $A=7\sim48$. The model is further applied to predict the binding energy difference of mirror hypernuclei of $A$=40 with the isospin $T=1/2$, $3/2$ and $5/2$ nuclei together with various hyper Ca isotopes and their mirror hypernuclei. Finally the binding energy systematics of $A=$48 hypernuclei are predicted with/without the CSB effect by the PK1 and TM2 energy density functionals (EDFs).</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and trace anomaly in a unified treatment of the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a unified perturbative treatment from the high-density side, we compute the speed of sound and the trace anomaly as functions of the chemical potential $\mu$ for the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter. We find that the corrections induced by the gap energy $\Delta$ involve nontrivial interplay between the dimensionless magnitude $|\Delta/\mu|$ and the derivative $|\partial\Delta/\partial\mu|$. Even though the gap equation has a common structure for these phases of our interest, different numerical constants cause drastic changes in the speed of sound corrections. As long as $|\Delta/\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Scattering: Connections Across Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>
