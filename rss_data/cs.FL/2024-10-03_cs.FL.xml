      <title>A Myhill-Nerode style Characterization for Timed Automata With Integer Resets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Nerode equivalence for finite words plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the class of regular languages. The equivalence leads to the Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical automaton, which in turn, is the basis of several automata learning algorithms. A Nerode-like equivalence has been studied for various classes of timed languages.
  In this work, we focus on timed automata with integer resets. This class is known to have good automata-theoretic properties and is also useful for practical modeling. Our main contribution is a Nerode-style equivalence for this class that depends on a constant K. We show that the equivalence leads to a Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical one-clock integer-reset timed automaton with maximum constant K. Based on the canonical form, we develop an Angluin-style active learning algorithm whose query complexity is polynomial in the size of the canonical form.</description>

      <title>History-deterministic Parikh Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parikh automata extend finite automata by counters that can be tested for membership in a semilinear set, but only at the end of a run. Thereby, they preserve many of the desirable properties of finite automata. Deterministic Parikh automata are strictly weaker than nondeterministic ones, but enjoy better closure and algorithmic properties. This state of affairs motivates the study of intermediate forms of nondeterminism. Here, we investigate history-deterministic Parikh automata, i.e., automata whose nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly. This restricted form of nondeterminism is well-suited for applications which classically call for determinism, e.g., solving games and composition. We show that history-deterministic Parikh automata are strictly more expressive than deterministic ones, incomparable to unambiguous ones, and enjoy almost all of the closure properties of deterministic automata. Finally, we investigate the complexity of resolving nondeterminism in history-deterministic Parikh automata.</description>

      <title>The NFA Acceptance Hypothesis: Non-Combinatorial and Dynamic Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pose the fine-grained hardness hypothesis that the textbook algorithm for the NFA Acceptance problem is optimal up to subpolynomial factors, even for dense NFAs and fixed alphabets.
  We show that this barrier appears in many variations throughout the algorithmic literature by introducing a framework of Colored Walk problems. These yield fine-grained equivalent formulations of the NFA Acceptance problem as problems concerning detection of an $s$-$t$-walk with a prescribed color sequence in a given edge- or node-colored graph. For NFA Acceptance on sparse NFAs (or equivalently, Colored Walk in sparse graphs), a tight lower bound under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis has been rediscovered several times in recent years. We show that our hardness hypothesis, which concerns dense NFAs, has several interesting implications:
  - It gives a tight lower bound for Context-Free Language Reachability. This proves conditional optimality for the class of 2NPDA-complete problems, explaining the cubic bottleneck of interprocedural program analysis.
  - It gives a tight $(n+nm^{1/3})^{1-o(1)}$ lower bound for the Word Break problem on strings of length $n$ and dictionaries of total size $m$.
  - It implies the popular OMv hypothesis. Since the NFA acceptance problem is a static (i.e., non-dynamic) problem, this provides a static reason for the hardness of many dynamic problems.
  Thus, a proof of the NFA Acceptance hypothesis would resolve several interesting barriers. Conversely, a refutation of the NFA Acceptance hypothesis may lead the way to attacking the current barriers observed for Context-Free Language Reachability, the Word Break problem and the growing list of dynamic problems proven hard under the OMv hypothesis.</description>
