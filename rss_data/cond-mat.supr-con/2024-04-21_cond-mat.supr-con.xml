      <title>Supercurrent rectification with time-reversal symmetry broken multiband superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonreciprocal supercurrent effects in Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors with a pairing structure that can break time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that a nonreciprocal supercurrent can be generally achieved by the cooperation of interband superconducting phase mismatch and interband scattering as well as by multiband phase frustration. The effect of interband impurity scattering indicates that the amplitude and sign of the nonreciprocal supercurrent are sensitive to the interband phase relation. For the case of a three-band superconductor, due to phase frustration, we show that the profile of the supercurrent rectification is marked by a hexagonal pattern of nodal lines with vanishing amplitude. Remarkably, around the nodal lines, the supercurrent rectification amplitude exhibits three-fold structures with an alternating sign. We show that the hexagonal pattern and the three-fold structure in the interband phase space turn out to be dependent on the tunneling amplitude of each band. These findings provide hallmarks of the supercurrent rectification which can be potentially employed to unveil the occurrence of spin-singlet multiband superconductivity with time-reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field driven evolution of zero-energy mode on Bi islands deposited on Fe(Te,Se)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependent evolution of the zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) on the nanoscale bismuth islands grown on the FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ substrate. The ZBCPs can be observed throughout the entire region on these islands, and their characteristics align with the signatures of Majorana zero modes. Remarkably, the evolution of ZBCPs on these islands exhibits anomalous behavior under varying magnetic fields: The magnitude of ZBCPs is first enhanced at weak fields lower than 2 T and then suppressed as the fields further increase. We attribute the non-monotonic evolution of the ZBCPs to the magnetic-field-enhanced topological edge states on these Bi islands. Our findings provide valuable insights into the probable origin of the Majorana zero modes in the Bi-island platform and the magnetic-field response of topological edge states.</description>

      <title>On the Path to High-temperature Josephson Multi-junction Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our progress in the high-temperature superconductor (HTS) Josephson junction fabrication process founded on using a focused helium ion beam damaging technique and discuss the expected device performance attainable with the HTS multi-junction device technology. Both the achievable high value of characteristic voltage $V_c=I_cR_N$ of Josephson junctions and the ability to design a large number of arbitrary located Josephson junctions allow narrowing the existing gap in design abilities for LTS and HTS circuits even with using a single YBCO film layer. A one-layer topology of active electrically small antenna is suggested and its voltage response characteristics are considered.</description>

      <title>Enhanced controllable triplet proximity effect in superconducting spin-orbit coupled spin valves with modified superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid, a magnetically controlled singlet-to-triplet Cooper pair conversion can modulate the superconducting critical temperature. In these triplet superconducting spin valves, such control usually requires inhomogeneous magnetism. However, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling from an interfacial heavy-metal layer, the singlet/triplet conversion rate and thus the critical temperature, can be controlled via the magnetization direction of a single homogeneous ferromagnet. Here, we report significantly enhanced controllable pair conversion to a triplet state in a Nb/Pt/Co/Pt superconducting spin valve in which Pt/Co/Pt is homogeneously magnetized and proximity-coupled to a superconducting layer of Nb. The Co/Pt interface furthest away from Nb is modified by a sub-nanometer-thick layer of Cu or Au. We argue that the enhancement is most likely associated from an improvement of the Co/Pt interface due to the insertion of Cu and Au layers. Additionally, the higher normalized orbital moments in Au measured using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows that increasing spin-orbit coupling enhances the triplet proximity effect - an observation supported by our theoretical calculations. Our results provide a pathway to enhancing triplet pair creation by interface engineering for device development in superspintronics.</description>

      <title>Flat-band ratio and quantum metric in the superconductivity of modified Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the band as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are calculated within cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find that while the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are good indicators of superconductivity near zero temperature, at finite temperatures the behavior is more complicated. Our results suggest that the properties of the other bands near the flat band(s) are crucial.</description>

      <title>d-wave Eliashberg theory with phonon softening describes superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>Using strain to uncover the interplay between two- and three-dimensional charge density waves in high-temperature superconducting YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\rm{y}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniaxial pressure provides an efficient approach to control the competition between charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity in underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\rm{y}}$. It can enhance the correlation volume of ubiquitous short-range 2D CDW correlations, and induces a long-range 3D CDW otherwise only accessible at large magnetic fields. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to study the strain and doping evolution of these CDWs. No signatures of discommensurations nor pair density waves are observed in the investigated strain-temperature parameter space, but direct evidence for a form of competition between 2D and 3D CDWs is uncovered. We show that the interplay between the 3D CDW, the 2D CDWs and superconductivity is qualitatively well described by including strain effects in simulations of a nonlinear sigma model of competing superconducting and CDW orders. From a broader perspective, our results underscore the potential of strain tuning as a powerful tool for probing and manipulating competing orders in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Near-power-law temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness in strongly disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In BCS superconductors, the superfluid stiffness is virtually constant at low temperature and only slightly affected by the exponentially low density of thermal quasiparticles. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study on the temperature dependence of superfluid stiffness $\Theta\left(T\right)$ in a strongly disordered pseudo-gaped superconductor, amorphous $\text{InO}_{x}$, which exhibits non-BCS behavior. Experimentally, we report an unusual power-law suppression of the superfluid stiffness $\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto T^{b}$ at $T\ll T_{c}$, with $b\sim1.6$, which we measured via the frequency shift of microwave resonators. Theoretically, by combining analytical and numerical methods to a model of a disordered superconductor with pseudogap and spatial inhomogeneities of the superconducting order parameter, we found a qualitatively similar low-temperature power-law behavior with exponent $b\sim1.6-3$ being disorder-dependent. This power-law suppression of the superfluid density occurs mainly due to the broad distribution of the superconducting order parameter that is known to exist in such superconductors [arXiv:1012.3630], even moderately far from the superconductor-insulator transition. The presence of the power-law dependence $\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto T^{b}$ at low $T\ll T_{c}$ demonstrates the existence of low-energy collective excitations; in turn, it implies the presence of a new channel of dissipation in inhomogeneous superconductors caused by sub-gap excitations that are not quasiparticles. Our findings have implications for the use of strongly disordered superconductors as superinductance in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Helical Topological Superconducting Pairing at Finite Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose helical topological superconductivity away from the Fermi surface in three-dimensional time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity multiband superconductors. In these systems, pairing between electrons originating from different bands is responsible for the corresponding topological phase transition. Consequently, a pair of helical topological Dirac surface states emerges at finite excitation energies. These helical Dirac surface states are tunable in energy by chemical potential and strength of band-splitting. They are protected by time-reversal symmetry combined with crystalline two-fold rotation symmetry. We suggest concrete materials in which this phenomenon could be observed.</description>

      <title>Hole doping and electronic correlations in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of superconductivity (SC) in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) is a well-established but poorly understood topic. It is also established that the suppression of the spin density wave transition temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) in CrBFA and Mn-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (MnBFA) almost coincides as a function of the Cr/Mn concentrations, irrespective of the putative distinct electronic effects of these substitutions. In this work, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and combined density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations (DFT+DMFT) to address the evolution of the Fermi surface (FS) and electronic correlations in CrBFA. Our findings reveal that incorporating Cr leads to an effective hole doping of the states near the FS in a way that can be well described within the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). Moreover, our results show orbital-specific correlation effects that support the Hund localization scenario for the CrBFA phase diagram. We found a fractional scaling of the imaginary part of self-energy as a function of the binding energy, which is a signature property of Hund's metals. We conclude that CrBFA is a correlated electron system for which the changes in the FS as a function of Cr are not related to the suppression of $T_{\text{SDW}}$. Rather, this suppression and the absence of SC are primarily due to the competition between Cr local moments and the Fe-derived itinerant spin fluctuations.</description>
