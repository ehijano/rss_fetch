      <title>Long-term evolution of the temperature structure in magnetized protoplanetary disks and its implication for the dichotomy of planetary composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks play a crucial role in planet formation. In addition to stellar irradiation, accretion heating is also believed to significantly affect the disk thermal structure and planet formation processes. We present the long-term evolution (from the beginning of Class II to disk dissipation) of thermal structures in laminar magnetized disks to investigate where and when accretion heating is a dominant heat source. In addition, we demonstrate how the difference in disk structures affects the water content of forming planets. We consider the mass loss by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative disk winds to investigate the influence of wind mass loss on the accretion rate profile. Our model includes the recent understanding of accretion heating; that is, the accretion heating in the laminar disks is less efficient than that in turbulent disks because of surface heating at optically thinner altitudes and energy removal by disk winds. We find that the accretion heating is weaker than irradiation heating at around 1--10 au even in the early Class II disk, whereas it can affect the temperature in the inner 1-au region. We also find that the MHD-wind mass loss in the inner region can significantly reduce the accretion rate compared with that in the outer region, in turn reducing accretion heating. Furthermore, using evolving disk structures, we demonstrate that updating accretion heating models impacts the evolution of protoplanets. In particular, we find that our model may produce a dichotomy of the planetary water fraction of 1--10 $M_\oplus$.</description>

      <title>A Swarm of WASP Planets: Nine giant planets identified by the WASP survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey provided some of the first transiting hot Jupiter candidates. With the addition of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), many WASP planet candidates have now been revisited and given updated transit parameters. Here we present 9 transiting planets orbiting FGK stars that were identified as candidates by the WASP survey and measured to have planetary masses by radial velocity measurements. Subsequent space-based photometry taken by TESS as well as ground-based photometric and spectroscopic measurements have been used to jointly analyze the planetary properties of WASP-102 b, WASP-116 b, WASP-149 b WASP-154 b, WASP-155 b, WASP-188 b, WASP-194 b/HAT-P-71 b, WASP-195 b, and WASP-197 b. These planets have radii between 0.9 R_Jup and 1.4 R_Jup, masses between 0.1 M_Jup and 1.5 M_Jup, and periods between 1.3 and 6.6 days.</description>

      <title>Origin of Phobos and Deimos : Orbital evolution shortly after formation from a potential dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the formation and evolution of Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos, assuming the dislocation of a larger progenitor as the origin of these moons. The study by Hyodo et al. (2022) argue that under somewhat simplistic modeling, the post-dislocation orbits of Phobos and Deimos inevitably collide within 10,000 years, leading to their mutual annihilation. These findings are based on $\mathcal{N}$-body simulations, accounting for Mars' $J_2$ and $J_4$ gravitational perturbations and mutual perturbations between the moons. In this paper, we challenge these findings by extending their work. We incorporate important perturbations such as solar perturbations, Mars' axial precession and nutation, and its deformation along three axes. We also extend some of the hypotheses made by Hyodo et al. (2022) concerning the initial distribution of Phobos and Deimos after the dislocation. Our analysis reveals that including these additional perturbations as well as the possibility of having more than two fragments after the dislocation does not alter the ultimate fate of Phobos and Deimos. The moons still converge towards collision within comparable timescales, supporting Hyodo et al. (2022) conclusions that the dislocation hypothesis under the dynamical scenario developed by Bagheri et al. (2021) has, in the best conditions, about 10\% chance of surviving after the first 100,000 years following their formation.</description>

      <title>Bifurcated Evolutionary Pathways in Multi-planet Systems Driven by Misaligned Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar obliquities, or spin-orbit angles, prevalent in exoplanet systems, can impose important constraints on their formation and evolution histories. Recent studies suggest that primordial misalignments between protoplanetary disks and stellar spin axes may significantly contribute to these obliquities, as those frequently observed in systems hosting hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar oblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their disk dispersal stages. Specifically, we identify bifurcated evolutionary pathways in multi-planet systems: systems with low star-disk misalignment angles ($\psi_{\star0}$) undergo smooth, adiabatic evolution, producing nearly coplanar, low-obliquity configurations; in contrast, systems with high misalignment angles typically experience an abrupt, non-adiabatic transition, leading to large-amplitude libration of mutual planetary inclinations and then triggering chaotic eccentricity excitation. This libration and eccentricity excitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet systems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system. The non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced effect, which occurs during disk dissipation when $\psi_{\star0}\gtrsim44.6^\circ$ (for one-planet systems). Our framework predicts that surviving typical compact multi-planet systems originating from misaligned disks evolve toward coplanar, low-obliquity configurations, consistent with observations of Kepler multi-planet systems. These results advance our understanding of planetary dynamics in misaligned disks and their evolutionary outcomes.</description>

      <title>ExoMolHR: A Relational Database of Empirical High-Resolution Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Space and Ground-Based Monitoring of Accretion Bursts in a Protoplanetary Disk: Establishing Mid-Infrared Hydrogen Lines as Accretion Diagnostics for JWST-MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish and calibrate mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines observed with JWST as accretion tracers for pre-main-sequence stars that accrete from circumstellar disks. This work is part of a coordinated, multi-observatory effort that monitored the well-known binary system DQ Tau over three orbital periods, capturing its periodic accretion bursts. In this first paper, we present 9 epochs of MIRI-MRS spectra with near-simultaneous LCO photometry and VLT X-Shooter spectroscopy. This program caught exceptional accretion variability, spanning almost two orders of magnitude between the peak of the first periastron accretion burst and the following quiescent phases. The MIRI spectra show H I line luminosities that vary in step with the accretion-luminosity time series measured with LCO and X-Shooter. The tight correlation with accretion and the large line widths, which MIRI resolves for the first time, support an accretion-flow origin for mid-infrared H I transitions. Combining these three exceptional datasets, we derive accurate relations between mid-infrared line and accretion luminosities for three H I transitions (10-7, 7-6, 8-7), and improve upon a previous relation based on Spitzer spectra. These new relations equip the community with a direct measurement of the accretion luminosity from MIRI-MRS spectra. A MIRI-derived accretion luminosity is fundamental for time-domain chemistry studies, as well as for studies of accretion in embedded/distant sources that are currently inaccessible in the optical. With these new relations, we provide accretion luminosities for an archival sample of 38 MRS spectra of protoplanetary disks published to date.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Cluster analysis of signals from spectral activity indicators to search for shared periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multitude of spectral activity indicators are routinely computed nowadays from the spectra generated as part of planet-hunting radial velocity surveys. Searching for shared periods among them can help to robustly identify astrophysical quantities of interest, such as the stellar rotation period. However, this identification can be complicated due to the fact that many different peaks occurring in the periodograms. This is especially true in the presence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences affecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find signals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in the periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we have looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and fundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms to find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR channels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently determined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals apparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the detection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample of 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of 59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition, we analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and its integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one underlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous studies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about scales of life and planetary replication.</description>

      <title>Planet formation theory: an overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model for planet formation is a bottom-up process in which the origin of rocky and gaseous planets can be traced back to the collision of micron-sized dust grains within the gas-rich environment of protoplanetary disks. Key milestones along the way include disk formation, grain growth, planetesimal formation, core growth, gas accretion, and planetary system evolution. I provide an introductory overview of planet formation, emphasizing the main ideas and reviewing current theoretical understanding. Many of the phases of planet formation have a well-developed physical understanding, though the complexity of the problem means that few can be quantitatively modeled with complete confidence. Transformative advances in disk imaging provide the first direct information on the initial conditions for planet formation, while exoplanet data has motivated new formation models that are faster, more efficient, and lead to a more diverse set of architectures than their Solar System inspired forebears. Much remains to be learned, and I close with a personal, incomplete list, of open problems.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 % (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>

      <title>Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with the Photonic Lantern Nuller</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets within a single beam-width from its host star. The PLN leverages the spatial symmetry of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to create nulled ports, which cancel out on-axis starlight but allow off-axis exoplanet light to couple. The null-depths are limited by wavefront aberrations in the system as well as by imperfections in the lantern. We show that the implicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar coupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority of the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher sensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff we observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some ports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead to deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports at once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port and discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for science observations.</description>
