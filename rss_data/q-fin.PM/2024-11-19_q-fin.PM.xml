      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Financial Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first discrete-time infinite-horizon dynamic formulation of the financial index tracking problem under both return-based tracking error and value-based tracking error. The formulation overcomes the limitations of existing models by incorporating the intertemporal dynamics of market information variables not limited to prices, allowing exact calculation of transaction costs, accounting for the tradeoff between overall tracking error and transaction costs, allowing effective use of data in a long time period, etc. The formulation also allows novel decision variables of cash injection or withdraw. We propose to solve the portfolio rebalancing equation using a Banach fixed point iteration, which allows to accurately calculate the transaction costs specified as nonlinear functions of trading volumes in practice. We propose an extension of deep reinforcement learning (RL) method to solve the dynamic formulation. Our RL method resolves the issue of data limitation resulting from the availability of a single sample path of financial data by a novel training scheme. A comprehensive empirical study based on a 17-year-long testing set demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms a benchmark method in terms of tracking accuracy and has the potential for earning extra profit through cash withdraw strategy.</description>

      <title>Dominance between combinations of infinite-mean Pareto random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic dominance between portfolios of independent and identically distributed (iid) extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) Pareto random variables. With the notion of majorization order, we show that a more diversified portfolio of iid extremely heavy-tailed Pareto random variables is larger in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result is further generalized for Pareto random variables caused by triggering events, random variables with tails being Pareto, bounded Pareto random variables, and positively dependent Pareto random variables. These results provide an important implication in investment: Diversification of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto profits uniformly increases investors' profitability, leading to a diversification benefit. Remarkably, different from the finite-mean setting, such a diversification benefit does not depend on the decision maker's risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Correlation Models for the Cross-Section of Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note discusses some of the aspects of a model for the covariance of equity returns based on a simple "isotropic" structure in which all pairwise correlations are taken to be the same value. The effect of the structure on feasible values for the common correlation of returns and on the "effective degrees of freedom" within the equity cross-section are discussed, as well as the impact of this constraint on the asymptotic Normality of portfolio returns. An eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is presented and used to partition variance into that from a common "market" factor and "non-diversifiable" idiosyncratic risk. A empirical analysis of the recent history of the returns of S&amp;P 500 Index members is presented and compared to the expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis supports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence in support of linear factor models. Analysis of portfolio selection under isotropic correlation is presented using mean-variance optimization for both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic cases. Portfolio selection for negative exponential utility maximizers is also discussed for the general case of distributions of returns with elliptical symmetry. The fact that idiosyncratic risk may not be removed by diversification in a model that the data supports undermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T. If the cross-section of equity returns is more accurately described by this structure then an inevitable consequence is that picking stocks is not a "pointless" activity, as the returns to residual risk would be non-zero.</description>

      <title>Keep it Tighter -- A Story on Analytical Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and flexible approaches in data science allowing to represent probability measures without loss of information under mild conditions. The resulting mapping called mean embedding gives rise to a divergence measure referred to as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with existing quadratic-time estimators (w.r.t. the sample size) and known convergence properties for bounded kernels. In this paper we focus on the problem of MMD estimation when the mean embedding of one of the underlying distributions is available analytically. Particularly, we consider distributions on the real line (motivated by financial applications) and prove tighter concentration for the proposed estimator under this semi-explicit setting; we also extend the result to the case of unbounded (exponential) kernel with minimax-optimal lower bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach beyond synthetic example in three real-world examples relying on one-dimensional random variables: index replication and calibration on loss-given-default ratios and on S&amp;P 500 data.</description>

      <title>Loss Aversion and State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, that incorporates the possibility of loss-aversion. Our results relate to first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss.</description>
