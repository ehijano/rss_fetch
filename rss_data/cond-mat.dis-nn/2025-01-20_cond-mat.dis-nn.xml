      <title>Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</description>

      <title>Irreversible swap algorithms for soft sphere glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend to soft repulsive interaction potentials a recently proposed irreversible swap algorithm originally designed for polydisperse hard spheres. The original algorithm performs rejection-free, irreversible, collective swap moves. We show that event-driven cluster updates of particle diameters can also be performed in continuous potentials by introducing a factorised Metropolis probability. However, the Metropolis factorisation needed to deal with continuous potentials decreases the efficiency of the algorithm and mitigates the benefits of breaking detailed balance. This leads us to propose another irreversible swap algorithm using the standard Metropolis probability that accelerates the relaxation of soft sphere glasses at low temperatures, compared to the original swap algorithm. We apply these efficient swap algorithms to produce very stable inherent structures with vibrational density of states lacking the quasi-localised excitations observed in conventional glasses.</description>

      <title>Emergent scales and spatial correlations at the yielding transition of glassy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy materials yield under large external mechanical solicitations. Under oscillatory shear, yielding shows a well-known rheological fingerprint, common to samples with widely different microstructures. At the microscale, this corresponds to a transition between slow, solid-like dynamics and faster liquid-like dynamics, which can coexist at yielding in a finite range of strain amplitudes. Here, we capture this phenomenology in a lattice model with two main parameters: glassiness and disorder, describing the average coupling between adjacent lattice sites, and their variance, respectively. In absence of disorder, our model yields a law of correspondent states equivalent to trajectories on a cusp catastrophe manifold, a well-known class of problems including equilibrium liquid-vapour phase transitions. Introducing a finite disorder in our model entails a qualitative change, to a continuous and rounded transition, whose extent is controlled by the magnitude of the disorder. We show that a spatial correlation length $\xi$ emerges spontaneously from the coupling between disorder and bifurcating dynamics. With vanishing disorder, $\xi$ diverges and yielding becomes discontinuous, suggesting that the abruptness of yielding can be rationalized in terms of a lengthscale of dynamic heterogeneities.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces in various fields of sciences. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization methods impose limitations on the interpretation and reproducibility of the resulting plots. Here, we propose using principal component analysis (PCA) for projecting hypercubes, which offers an automated, interpretable, and reproducible solution. We reveal analytically and numerically that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions in the state space. The resulting distribution of projected vertices is shown to be asymptotically the standard Gaussian, a characteristic of high-dimensional orthogonal projections. This method is applied to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, where the biplots reveal the pathways involving correlated spin flips. Our work demonstrates the potential of PCA for discovering hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean-field theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models is developed by considering the Fredrickson-Andersen model on the Bethe lattice. Using certain properties of the dynamics observed in actual numerical experiments we derive asymptotic dynamical equations equal to those of Mode-Coupling-Theory. Analytical predictions obtained for the dynamical exponents are successfully compared with numerical simulations in a wide range of models, including the case of generic values of the connectivity and the facilitation, random pinning and fluctuating facilitation. The theory is thus validated for both continuous and discontinuous transitions and also in the case of higher order critical points characterized by logarithmic decays.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions induced by quantum-data collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entanglement transition in an array of qubits, induced by the transfer of quantum information from a system to a quantum computer. This quantum-data collection is an essential protocol in quantum machine learning algorithms that promise exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. In this and an accompanying work [Phys. Rev. A 111, 012425 (2025)], we identify sufficient conditions for an entanglement transition to occur in the late time state of the system and quantum computer. In this letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a 1D chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction $p$ of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate $p$ is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization: theory and experimentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.</description>
