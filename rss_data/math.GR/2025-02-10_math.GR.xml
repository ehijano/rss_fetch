      <title>Cartan motion groups: regularity of K-finite matrix coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center and $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of G, then the Lie algebra of $G$ admits a Cartan decomposition $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{p}$. This allows us to define the Cartan motion group $H=\mathfrak{p}\rtimes K$. In this paper, we study the regularity of $K$-finite matrix coefficients of unitary representations of $H$. We prove that the optimal exponent $\kappa(G)$ for which all such coefficients are $\kappa(G)$-H\"older continuous coincides with the optimal regularity of all $K$-finite coefficients of the group $G$ itself. Our approach relies on stationary phase techniques that were previously employed by the author to study regularity in the setting of $(G,K)$. Furthermore, we provide a general framework to reduce the question of regularity from $K$-finite coefficients to $K$-bi-invariant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cops and robbers for hyperbolic and virtually free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche define two new group invariants, the strong cop number $\operatorname{sCop}$ and the weak cop number $\operatorname{wCop}$, by examining winning strategies for certain combinatorial games played on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. We show that a finitely generated group $G$ is Gromov-hyperbolic if and only if $\operatorname{sCop(G)} = 1$. We show that $G$ is virtually free if and only if $\operatorname{wCop(G)}=1$, answering a question by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. We show that $\operatorname{sCop}(\mathbb{Z}^2) = \infty$, answering a question from the original paper. It is still unknown whether there exist finite cop numbers not equal to 1, but we show that this is not possible for CAT(0)-groups. We provide machinery to explicitly compute strong cop numbers and give examples by applying it to certain lamplighter groups, the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, and Thompson's group F.</description>

      <title>On Normal Subgroups of Twisted Chevalley Groups over Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two structure theorems for twisted Chevalley groups $G_\sigma (R)$ over a commutative ring $R$ with unity. The first theorem concerns the normality of $E'_\sigma (R,J)$, the elementary congruence subgroups at level $J$, in the group $G_\sigma (R)$. The second theorem classifies all subgroups of $G_\sigma (R)$ normalized by its elementary subgroup $E'_\sigma (R)$. Along the way, we obtain several interesting results. For instance, when $R$ is a semilocal ring, we show that $G_\sigma(R)$ can be expressed as the (internal) product of $E'_\sigma (R)$ and the maximal torus $T_\sigma (R)$ of $G_\sigma (R)$.</description>

      <title>On the submonoid membership problem for HNN extensions of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study membership problems in HNN extensions of free groups and then apply these results to solve the word problem in certain families of one-relator inverse monoids. In more detail, we consider HNN extensions where the defining isomorphism produces a bijection between subsets of a basis of the free group. Within such HNN extensions we identify natural conditions on submonoids of this group that suffice for membership in that submonoid to be decidable. We show that these results can then be applied to solve the prefix membership problem in certain one-relator groups which via results of Ivanov, Margolis and Meakin $(2001)$ then give solutions to the word problem for the corresponding one-relator inverse monoid. In particular our new techniques allow us to solve the word problem in an example (Example $7.6$) from Dolinka and Gray $(2021)$ which previous methods had not been able to resolve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an infinite family of sofic one-relator groups that are not residually solvable nor residually finite. The proof is essentially different from the one in [1], as it does not require just Magnus' decompositions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that bounded conciseness is a closed property in the space of marked groups. As a consequence, we reformulate a conjecture of Fern\'andez-Alcober and Shumyatsky [7] about conciseness in the class of residually finite groups.</description>

      <title>Central extensions and almost representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of unital tracial $C^*$-algebras $(A_n,\tau_n),$ we construct a canonical central extension of the unitary group $U(\ell^\infty (\mathbb{N},A_n)/c_0(\mathbb{N},A_n))$ by $Q(\mathbb{R})=c_0(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R})/\mathbb{R}^\infty,$ using de la Harpe-Skandalis pre-determinant. For an asymptotic group homomorphism $\rho_n : \Gamma \to U(A_n),$ the corresponding pullback of the canonical central extension gives a 2-cohomology class in $H^2(\Gamma,Q(\mathbb{R}))$ which obstructs the perturbation of $(\rho_n)$ to a sequence of true homomorphisms of groups $\pi_n:\Gamma \to GL(A_n)$. The pairing of the obstruction class with elements of $H_2(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})$ yields numerical invariants in $\tau_{n\,*} (K_0(A_n))$ that subsume the winding number invariants of Kazhdan, Exel and Loring. For generality, we allow bounded asymptotic homomorphisms to map the group $\Gamma$ into the general linear group of any sequence of tracial unital Banach algebras. In that case, the obstruction class belongs to $H^2(\Gamma,Q(\mathbb{C})),$ where $Q(\mathbb{C})=c_0(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{C}^\infty.$ As an application, we show that 2-cohomology obstructs various stability properties under weaker assumptions than those found in existing literature. In particular we show that the full group $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ of a discrete group $\Gamma$ is not $C^*$-stable if $H^2(\Gamma,\mathbb{R})\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups I: uncountably many coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a sphere with five punctures admits uncountably many non-equivalent, coarsely equivariant coarse median structures, falsifying a folklore belief. The same is shown for right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs are connected, triangle- and square-free, and have at least three vertices. Remarkably, in the latter case the coarse medians we produce are not induced by cocompact cubulations. In the process, we develop the theory of short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs), which also include Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type, graph manifolds groups, and extensions of Veech groups. We develop tools to modify their hierarchical structure, including using quasimorphisms to construct quasilines that serve as coordinate spaces, and this is where the abundance of coarse median structures comes from. These techniques are of independent interest, and we use them in a forthcoming paper to study quotients of short HHGs.</description>

      <title>Strongly sofic monoids, sofic topological entropy, and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the class of strongly sofic monoids. This class of monoids strictly contains the class of sofic groups and is a proper subclass of the class of sofic monoids. We define and investigate sofic topological entropy for actions of strongly sofic monoids on compact spaces. We show that sofic topological entropy is a topological conjugacy invariant for such actions and use this fact to prove that every strongly sofic monoid is surjunctive. This means that if $M$ is a strongly sofic monoid and $A$ is a finite alphabet set, then every injective cellular automaton $\tau \colon A^M \to A^M$ is surjective. As an application, we prove that the monoid algebra of a strongly sofic monoid with coefficients in an arbitrary field is always stably finite. Our results are extensions to strongly sofic monoids of two previously known properties of sofic groups. The first one is the celebrated Gromov-Weiss theorem asserting that every sofic group is surjunctive. The second is the Elek-Szab\'o theorem which says that group algebras of sofic groups satisfy Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups II: quotients and the Hopf property for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that most Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type are Hopfian, meaning that every self-epimorphism is an isomorphism. The class covered by our result is generic, in the sense of Goldsborough-Vaskou. Moreover, assuming the residual finiteness of certain hyperbolic groups with an explicit presentation, we get that all large and hyperbolic type Artin groups are residually finite. We also show that most quotients of the five-holed sphere mapping class group are hierarchically hyperbolic, up to taking powers of the normal generators of the kernels. The main tool we use to prove both results is a Dehn-filling-like procedure for short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (these also include e.g. non-geometric 3-manifolds, and triangle- and square-free RAAGs).</description>

      <title>Finite groups admitting a regular tournament $m$-semiregular representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $m$, a finite group $G$ is said to admit a tournament $m$-semiregular representation (TmSR for short) if there exists a tournament $\Gamma$ such that the automorphism group of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $G$ and acts semiregularly on the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with $m$ orbits. Clearly, every finite group of even order does not admit a TmSR for any positive integer $m$, and T1SR is the well-known tournament regular representation (TRR for short). In 1986, Godsil \cite{god} proved, by a probabilistic approach, that the only finite groups of odd order without a TRR are $\mathbb{Z}_3^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3^3$ .
  More recently, Du \cite{du} proved that every finite group of odd order has a TmSR for every $m \geq 2$. The author of \cite{du} observed that a finite group of odd order has no regular TmSR when $m$ is an even integer, a group of order $1$ has no regular T3SR, and $\mathbb{Z}_3^2$ admits a regular T3SR. At the end of \cite{du}, Du proposed the following problem.
  \noindent{\sf\it Problem.} \ \ {\it For every odd integer $m\geq 3$, classify finite groups of odd order which have a regular TmSR.}
  The motivation of this paper is to give an answer for the above problem. We proved that if $G$ is a finite group with odd order $n&gt;1$, then $G$ admits a regular TmSR for any odd integer $m\geq 3$.</description>
