      <title>Strongly Interacting Quark Matter in Massive Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high densities in a quark star (QS). The QS is built from the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM), modified to obtain higher maximum gravitational mass ($\rm M_{max}$) of the QS using the data from observed pulsars: XMMU J173203.3-344518, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0952-0607 as constraints in Bayesian inference. We observed that the quark matter (QM) that composes QSs with $\rm M_{max} &gt; 2M_\odot$ violates the conformality criteria determined through conformal field theory. This behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the increase in quark population with $\rho_B$ and the concomitant formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, which are influenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\rho_B$ increases. This is reflected in the enhanced DDQM model employed, which introduces an additional term relevant at high densities. On the other hand, for $\rm M_{max} &lt; 2M_\odot$ we observed the desired behavior of the QM as predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at higher densities, where the interaction decreases with increasing $\rho_B$ and eventually the quarks become deconfined due to the depletion of the DDQM through an additional attractive contribution in this case.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameter space in dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties using the relativistic mean-field theory. By incorporating the dark matter model, we explore how dark matter parameters, specifically dark matter mass and Fermi momentum, influence nuclear saturation properties, the equation of state, and the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars. We also examine the universal relation between dimensionless tidal deformability and compactness in the presence of dark matter. Our results show that the inclusion of dark matter significantly alters nuclear saturation properties, leading to higher incompressibility and symmetry energy values. Notably, higher dark matter Fermi momenta and masses result in more compact neutron star configurations with reduced radii and lower maximum masses, highlighting a complex interplay between dark matter and nuclear matter. Deviations from the universal relation are observed with dark matter inclusion, particularly for neutron stars with lower compactness. By leveraging observational data from PSR J0740+6620, GW170817, and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) measurements of PSR J0030+0451, we derive stringent constraints on dark matter parameter space within neutron stars, emphasizing the necessity of integrating multimodal observations to delineate the properties of dark matter along with neutron stars. Our findings underscore the importance of considering dark matter effects in neutron star modeling and suggest potential refinements for current theoretical frameworks to accurately predict neutron star properties under various astrophysical conditions.</description>

      <title>Production and in-medium modification of $\phi$ mesons in proton-nucleus reactions from a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Production and in-medium modification of hidden strange $\phi$ mesons are studied in proton-nucleus reactions - p+C, p+Cu and p+Pb - at 12 GeV/c, partially measured by the KEK E325 collaboration via the dilepton decay mode. This work is based on the off-shell microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which provides the dynamical description of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom in dense matter, and especially makes it possible to simulate in-medium off-shell dynamics of the $\phi$ meson in the reactions studied. Different in-medium scenarios for the modification of the $\phi$ meson spectral function in nuclear matter are investigated: i) dropping pole mass, ii) collisional broadening and iii) simultaneous dropping pole mass and collisional broadening. Even though the $\phi$ meson production in p+A reactions occurs only at densities around or below normal nuclear matter density $\rho_0$, we find visible modifications of the generated dilepton spectra for the in-medium scenarios compared to the vacuum distribution.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of the quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $p$-$\Omega$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental measurements, we investigate the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions and interactions. By solving the inverse scattering problem, we derive the $p$-$\Omega$ potentials from a quark model. The effects of Coulomb interaction and spin-averaging are discussed. According to our results, the depletion of the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions, attributed to the $J^P = 2^+$ bound state not observed in the ALICE Collaboration's measurements [Nature \textbf{588}, 232 (2020)], can be explained by the contribution of the attractive $J^P = 1^+$ component in spin-averaging. Additionally, there is a subtle sub-unity part of the correlation function, which can also be seen in the experimental data, supporting the existence of the $p$-$\Omega$ bound state. So far, we have completed the consistent description of the $p$-$\Omega$ system from the perspective of the quark model in terms of energy spectrum, scattering phase shift, and correlation function. The existence of the $p$-$\Omega$ bound state has been confirmed from these three aspects. In Appendix, we learn the relationship between correlation functions and interaction potentials by using simplified square potential models and find a periodic-like variation.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>

      <title>Systematic investigation of the nuclear multiple deformations in U+U collisions with A Multi-Phase Transport model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to study the shape of colliding nuclei, even up to higher-order multiple deformations. In this work, several observables that are sensitive to quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations of Uranium-238 in relativistic U+U collisions have been systematically investigated with A Multi-Phase Transport model. We find that the flow harmonic $v_{2}$, the $v_{2}$ and mean transverse momentum correlation, and the three-particle asymmetry cumulant ${\rm ac}_{2}\{3\}$ are sensitive to nuclear quadrupole deformation, while ${\rm ac}_{2}\{3\}$ and nonlinear response coefficient $\chi_{4,22}$ are sensitive to nuclear hexadecapole deformation. Our results from transport model studies are in qualitative agreement with previous hydrodynamic studies. The results indicate that the uncertainties of the hexadecapole deformation of Uranium on the quadrupole deformation determination can be reduced by the abundance of correlation observables provided by the relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Universal separable structure of the optical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a momentum-space in-medium folding model, we disclose the universal separability of the optical potential, revealing its radial and nonlocality features at beam energies in the range 40 - 400 MeV and target mass numbers in the range $40\le A\le 208$. From this microscopic study we find that the nonlocality form factor is inherently complex and of hydrogenic nature, affecting both central and spin-orbit components of the potential. A striking outcome from this study is the consistent appearance of a nodal point in the imaginary radial form factor, notably suppressing surface absorption peaks, in evident contrast with Woods-Saxon's assumption of an absorptive peak at the nuclear surface. Our analysis reveals that the complex radial form factor can effectively be represented as convolutions of uniform spherical distribution with a Gaussian form factor and a Yukawa term. These robust microscopically-driven findings offer new ways for investigating nuclear reactions beyond the restricting Woods-Saxon and Perey-Buck assumptions.</description>

      <title>Inverse-scattering separable NN potential constrained to phase-shift data up to 2.5 GeV. I.- Uncoupled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to construct, within inverse-scattering theory, an energy-independent separable potential capable of reproducing exactly both phase shift and absorption over a predefined energy range. The approach relies on the construction of non-overlapping multi-rank separable potentials, whose form factors are obtained by solving linear equations on intervals where the $K$ matrix does have zeros. Applications are made to nucleon-nucleon $NN$ interactions constrained to the SAID-SP07 phase-shift analysis up to 2.5 GeV lab energy. The inversion potentials are channel dependent with rank dictated by the number of zeros of the $K$ matrix, reproducing the data up to a selected upper momentum. The account for absorption yields complex separable form factors, resulting in a non-Hermitian potential. Applications are restricted to $NN$ spin-uncoupled states considering a Schr\"odinger-like wave equation with minimal relativity. Its extension to spin-coupled states and relativistic kernels are discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>What does perturbative QCD really have to say about neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\sim2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\sim0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint, and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory, numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions. Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b) and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.</description>

Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation.</description>
