      <title>Sensitivity and Performance of LBTI/NOMIC Spectroscopy: Prospects for 10- and 30-meter class Mid-IR Exoplanet Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long wavelength infrared (8-13 $\mu$m) spectroscopy is invaluable for detecting molecular features in the atmospheres of gas giant and terrestrial exoplanets. The nulling-optimized mid-infrared camera (NOMIC) on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) has a low resolution (R$\sim$200) germanium grism that was previously installed but has not been characterized and commissioned for scientific observations. Using a 1.27 mm slit and broadband filter in combination with the grism, the infrared window between 8-13 $\mu$m can be captured. We describe initial on sky testing of the LBTI/NOMIC grism mode with adaptive optics to study standard stars and binaries. We discuss the impact of observational strategy and telluric calibration on the spectral reduction process. We infer the impact of existing mid-infrared detectors on NOMIC's spectroscopic mode and discuss requirements to enable higher resolution 8-13 $\mu$m spectroscopy on current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Interior transit orbits in the planar bicircular restricted four-body problem: classification and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy transfers are advantageous for lunar exploration missions due to low fuel consumption and extended launch periods. This paper is devoted to the classification of interior transit orbits and their application on low-energy transfer in the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem (PBCR4BP). First, the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are introduced to generate the interior transit orbits. The number of periapses about the Moon is selected as the classification parameter and mapped into the LCSs, achieving clear classification boundaries. Then, the evolution laws of the classifications with respect to energy and solar gravity perturbation are discussed and summarized. Construction strategies for low-energy transfer are proposed based on the classifications and their evolution laws. Numerical simulation of the transfer trajectories verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. The dynamical behaviors and transfer characteristics of transit orbits and their families are revealed, and a direct link between transit orbit families and low-energy transfers is finally established.</description>

      <title>Surviving in the Hot Neptune Desert: The Discovery of the Ultra-Hot Neptune TOI-3261b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discoveries of Neptune-sized ultra-short period planets (USPs) challenge existing planet formation theories. It is unclear whether these residents of the Hot Neptune Desert have similar origins to smaller, rocky USPs, or if this discrete population is evidence of a different formation pathway altogether. We report the discovery of TOI-3261b, an ultra-hot Neptune with an orbital period $P$ = 0.88 days. The host star is a $V = 13.2$ magnitude, slightly super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $\simeq$ 0.15), inactive K1.5 main sequence star at $d = 300$ pc. Using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, we find that TOI-3261b has a radius of $3.82_{-0.35}^{+0.42}$ $R_{\oplus}$. Moreover, radial velocities from ESPRESSO and HARPS reveal a mass of $30.3_{-2.4}^{+2.2}$ $M_{\oplus}$, more than twice the median mass of Neptune-sized planets on longer orbits. We investigate multiple mechanisms of mass loss that can reproduce the current-day properties of TOI-3261b, simulating the evolution of the planet via tidal stripping and photoevaporation. Thermal evolution models suggest that TOI-3261b should retain an envelope potentially enriched with volatiles constituting $\sim$5% of its total mass. This is the second highest envelope mass fraction among ultra-hot Neptunes discovered to date, making TOI-3261b an ideal candidate for atmospheric follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. We find that critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9\% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 = 10$--20~au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$~Myr~pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>MIRI MRS Observations of Beta Pictoris II. The Spectroscopic Case for a Recent Giant Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI MRS on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the IRS on board Spitzer. The bright 5 - 15 $\mu$m continuum excess modeled using a $\sim$600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust ($\sim$100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from $\sim$300 K to $\sim$500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 years between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the $\beta$ Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.</description>

      <title>The TROY project III. Exploring co-orbitals around low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-orbital objects, also known as trojans, are frequently found in simulations of planetary system formation. In these configurations, a planet shares its orbit with other massive bodies. It is still unclear why there have not been any co-orbitals discovered thus far in exoplanetary systems or even pairs of planets found in such a 1:1 mean motion resonance. Reconciling observations and theory is an open subject in the field. The main objective of the TROY project is to conduct an exhaustive search for exotrojans using diverse observational techniques. In this work, we analyze the radial velocity time series informed by transits, focusing the search around low-mass stars. We employed the alpha-test method on confirmed planets searching for shifts between spectral and photometric mid-transit times. This technique is sensitive to mass imbalances within the planetary orbit, allowing us to identify non-negligible co-orbital masses. Among the 95 transiting planets examined, we find one robust exotrojan candidate with a significant 3-sigma detection. Additionally, 25 exoplanets show compatibility with the presence of exotrojan companions at a 1-sigma level, requiring further observations to better constrain their presence. For two of those weak candidates, we find dimmings in their light curves within the predicted Lagrangian region. We established upper limits on the co-orbital masses for either the candidates and null detections. Our analysis reveals that current high-resolution spectrographs effectively rule out co-orbitals more massive than Saturn around low-mass stars. This work points out to dozens of targets that have the potential to better constraint their exotrojan upper mass limit with dedicated radial velocity observations. We also explored the potential of observing the secondary eclipses of the confirmed exoplanets to enhance the exotrojan search.</description>

      <title>The miscibility of hydrogen and water in planetary atmospheres and interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many planets in the solar system and across the galaxy have hydrogen-rich atmospheres overlying more heavy element-rich interiors with which they interact for billions of years. Atmosphere-interior interactions are thus crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these bodies. However, this understanding is still lacking in part because the relevant pressure-temperature conditions are extreme. We conduct molecular dynamics simulations based on Density Functional Theory to investigate how hydrogen and water interact over a wide range of pressure and temperature, encompassing the interiors of Neptune-sized and smaller planets. We determine the critical curve at which a single homogeneous phase exsolves into two separate, hydrogen-rich and water-rich phases, finding good agreement with existing experimental data. We find that the temperature along the critical curve increases with increasing pressure and shows the influence of a change in fluid structure from molecular to atomic near 30 GPa and 3000 K, which may impact magnetic field generation. The internal temperatures of many exoplanets, including TOI-270 d and K2-18 b may lie entirely above the critical curve: the envelope is expected to consist of a single homogeneous hydrogen-water fluid, that is much less susceptible to atmospheric loss as compared with a pure hydrogen envelope. As planets cool, they cross the critical curve, leading to rainout of water-rich fluid and an increase in internal luminosity. Compositions of the resulting outer, hydrogen-rich, and inner, water-rich envelopes depend on age and instellation and are governed by thermodynamics. Rainout of water may be occurring in Uranus and Neptune at present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, progress in observational capabilities, combined with theoretical advancements, have transformed our comprehension of the physics and chemistry during planet formation. Despite these important steps forward, open questions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their journey from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This chapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to identify the most promising avenues for future research based on current observational and modeling opportunities.</description>

      <title>Measuring stellar surface rotation and activity with the PLATO mission -- I. Strategy and application to simulated light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars mission (PLATO) will allow us to measure surface rotation and monitor photometric activity of tens of thousands of main sequence solar-type and subgiant stars. This paper is the first of a series dedicated to the preparation of the analysis of stellar surface rotation and photospheric activity with the near-future PLATO data. We describe in this work the strategy that will be implemented in the PLATO pipeline to measure stellar surface rotation, photometric activity, and long-term modulations. The algorithms are applied on both noise-free and noisy simulations of solar-type stars, which include activity cycles, latitudinal differential rotation, and spot evolution. PLATO simulated systematics are included in the noisy light curves. We show that surface rotation periods can be recovered with confidence for most of the stars with only six months of observations and that the {recovery rate} of the analysis significantly improves as additional observations are collected. This means that the first PLATO data release will already provide a substantial set of measurements for this quantity, with a significant refinement on their quality as the instrument obtains longer light curves. Measuring the Schwabe-like magnetic activity cycle during the mission will require that the same field be observed over a significant timescale (more than four years). Nevertheless, PLATO will provide a vast and robust sample of solar-type stars with constraints on the activity-cycle length. Such a sample is lacking from previous missions dedicated to space photometry.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems II: A 1 to 20 Micron Spectrum of the Planetary-Mass Companion VHS 1256-1257 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the highest fidelity spectrum to date of a planetary-mass object. VHS 1256 b is a $&lt;$20 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ widely separated ($\sim$8\arcsec, a = 150 au), young, planetary-mass companion that shares photometric colors and spectroscopic features with the directly imaged exoplanets HR 8799 c, d, and e. As an L-to-T transition object, VHS 1256 b exists along the region of the color-magnitude diagram where substellar atmospheres transition from cloudy to clear. We observed VHS 1256~b with \textit{JWST}'s NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS modes for coverage from 1 $\mu$m to 20 $\mu$m at resolutions of $\sim$1,000 - 3,700. Water, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sodium, and potassium are observed in several portions of the \textit{JWST} spectrum based on comparisons from template brown dwarf spectra, molecular opacities, and atmospheric models. The spectral shape of VHS 1256 b is influenced by disequilibrium chemistry and clouds. We directly detect silicate clouds, the first such detection reported for a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>The New Horizons Extended Mission Target: Arrokoth Search and Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Pluto fly-by of the New Horizons spacecraft, the mission provided a unique opportunity to explore the Kuiper Belt in-situ. The possibility existed to fly-by a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) as well as to observe additional objects at distances closer than are feasible from earth-orbit facilities. However, at the time of launch no KBOs were known about that were accessible by the spacecraft. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of observations and three uniquely dedicated efforts -- two ground-based using the Subaru Suprime Camera, the Magellan MegaCam and IMACS Cameras, and one with the Hubble Space Telescope -- to find such KBOs for study. In this paper we overview the search criteria and strategies employed in our work and detail the analysis efforts to locate and track faint objects in the galactic plane. We also present a summary of all of the KBOs that were discovered as part of our efforts and how spacecraft targetability was assessed, including a detailed description of our astrometric analysis which included development of an extensive secondary calibration network. Overall, these efforts resulted in the discovery of 89 KBOs including 11 which became objects for distant observation by New Horizons and (486958) Arrokoth which became the first post-Pluto fly-by destination.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 Iberian superbolide from a sunskirting orbit: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>

Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 1 m, entering the atmosphere at 40.4 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ with an average slope of 8.5$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 133 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit had an inclination of 16.4$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.952, a semi-major axis of 2.4 au, and a short perihelion distance of 0.12 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) and the European Space Agency (ESA), as well as by the U.S. Government (USG) sensors from space. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 0.56$^\circ$ and 0.1 km$\,$s$^{-1}$, respectively. The presence of detached fragments in the lower part of the luminous trajectory suggests that the meteoroid was a polymict carbonaceous chondrite, containing higher-strength macroscopic particles in its interior due to collisional gardening, or a thermally processed C-type asteroid. The orbital elements indicate that the most likely source is the Jupiter-Family Comet (JFC) region, aligning with the SOHO comet family, as its sunskirting orbit is decoupled from Jupiter. This event provides important information to characterize the disruption mechanism of near-Sun objects.</description>

      <title>From super-Earths to sub-Neptunes: Observational constraints and connections to theoretical models</title>

Abstract: We have updated the PlanetS catalog of transiting planets with precise and robust mass and radius measurements and use this catalog to explore mass-radius (M-R) diagrams. On the one hand, we propose new M-R relationships to separate exoplanets into three populations. On the other hand, we explore the transition in radius and density between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes around M-dwarfs and compare them with those orbiting K- and FG-dwarfs. Using Kernel density estimation method with a re-sampling technique, we estimated the normalized density and radius distributions, revealing connections between observations and theories on composition, internal structure, formation, and evolution of these exoplanets orbiting different spectral types. The 30% increase in the number of well-characterized exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs compared with previous studies shows us that there is no clear gap in either composition or radius between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. The "water-worlds" around M-dwarfs cannot correspond to a distinct population, their bulk density and equilibrium temperature can be interpreted by several different internal structures and compositions. The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. We find that the transition between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different masses (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of super-Earths seems to be close to 10~M$_\oplus$ for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of sub-Neptunes increases with the star's mass. This effect, attributed to planet migration, also contributes to the fading of the radius valley for M-planets compared to FGK-planets. While sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: How formation and migration histories of giant planets impact atmospheric compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey will compare the compositions of 8 hot Jupiters around F stars, 4 with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis and 4 misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (O/H &gt; 10 times solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (&lt; 0.25) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O &gt; 0.6), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.</description>

      <title>When the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods do not coincide: the impact of post-Keplerian perturbing accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a purely Keplerian picture, the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods of a test particle orbiting a massive body coincide with each other. Such a degeneracy is removed when a post-Keplerian perturbing acceleration enters the equations of motion yielding generally different corrections to the Keplerian period for the three aforementioned characteristic orbital timescales. They are analytically worked out in the case of the accelerations induced by the general relativistic post-Newtonian gravitoelectromagnetic fields and, to the Newtonian level, by the oblateness of the central body as well. The resulting expressions hold for completely general orbital configurations and spatial orientations of the spin axis of the primary. Astronomical systems characterized by extremely accurate measurements of the orbital periods like, e.g., transiting exoplanets and binary pulsars, may offer potentially viable scenarios for measuring such post--Keplerian features of motion, at least in principle. As an example, the sidereal period of the brown dwarf WD1032 + 011 b is currently known with an uncertainty as small as $\simeq 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{s}$, while its predicted post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction amounts to $0.07\,\mathrm{s}$; however, the accuracy with which the Keplerian period can be calculated is just 572 s. For the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the largest relativistic correction to the anomalistic period amounts to a few tenths of a second, given a measurement error of such a characteristic orbital timescale as small as $\simeq 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{s}$. On the other hand, the Keplerian term can be currently calculated just to a $\simeq 9$ s accuracy. In principle, measuring at least two of the three characteristic orbital periods for the same system independently would allow to cancel out their common Keplerian component provided that their difference is taken.</description>

      <title>The Brown Dwarf Kinematics Project (BDKP). VI. Ultracool Dwarf Radial and Rotational Velocities from SDSS/APOGEE High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13760</link>

Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>
