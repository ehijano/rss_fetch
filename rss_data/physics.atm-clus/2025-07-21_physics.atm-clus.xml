      <title>Time-resolved solvation of alkali ions in superfluid helium nanodroplets: Theoretical simulation of a pump-probe study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solvation process of an alkali ion (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, Cs$^+$) inside a superfluid $^4$He$_{2000}$ nanodroplet is investigated theoretically using liquid $^4$He time-dependent density functional theory at zero temperature. We simulate both steps of the pump-probe experiment conducted on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., Nature 623, 319 (2023)], where the alkali atom residing at the droplet surface is ionized by the pump pulse and its solvation is probed by ionizing a central xenon atom and detecting the expulsed Na$^+$He$_n$ ions. Our results confirm the Poissonian model for the binding of the first five He atoms for the lighter Na$^+$ and K$^+$ alkalis, with a rate in good agreement with the more recent experimental results on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 174309 (2025)]. For the probe step we show that the ion takes several picoseconds to get out of the droplet. During this rather long time, the solvation structure around it is very hot and far from equilibrium, and it can gain or lose more He atoms. Surprisingly, analysing the Na$^+$ solvation structure energy reveals that it is not stable by itself during the first few picoseconds of the solvation process. After that, energy relaxation follows a Newton behavior, as found experimentally, but with a longer time delay, $5.0\leq t_0\leq 6.5$ ps vs. $0.23\pm0.06$ ps, and characteristic decay time, $7.3\le\tau\le 16.5$ ps vs. $2.6\pm 0.4$ ps. We conclude that the first instants of the solvation process are highly turbulent and that the solvation structure is stabilized only by the surrounding helium ``solvent''.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a cost-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 102 pg to 355 pg. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates were identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>
