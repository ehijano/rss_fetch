      <title>Achromatic, spin-odd Kerr EVPA as a null Frenet--Serret torsion integral on the photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.</description>

      <title>Gravitational decoupling and regular hairy black holes: Geodesic stability, quasinormal modes, and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of geodesic orbits around a regular hairy black hole, in the gravitational decoupling setup, is investigated by employing Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the divergence rate of nearby trajectories in dynamical systems. Both timelike and null geodesics are addressed, probing the effect of the hair parameter on orbital stability. Deviations from the Schwarzschild solution have a significant influence on orbit stability, potentially providing observational signatures. Quasinormal modes of regular hairy black holes are calculated, and their thermodynamic properties are discussed. Both the R\'enyi and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies are reported, deepening our understanding of gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, contributing to ongoing approaches to modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced the $\ell$-boson stars, a generalization of standard boson stars, which are parameterized by an angular momentum number $\ell$, while still preserving the spacetime's spherical symmetry. In this article, we present and study the properties of $\ell$-boson stars in spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant, such that they are asymptotically anti-de Sitter.</description>

      <title>Axions, Black Holes and the Detection of Gravitons: from Astrophysics to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Models with Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity and its Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates late-time cosmic acceleration using modified gravity theories with a focus on $f(Q)$ gravity, as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The standard cosmological model attributes the acceleration to a cosmological constant, but it faces issues like the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and discrepancies with certain observations. Modified gravity including $f(Q)$ gravity, offers a potential solution by incorporating dynamic dark energy or changes to gravitational interactions, avoiding the need for a constant cosmological term. Also, thesis evaluates the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity by analyzing observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements and other cosmological datasets. Using statistical tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, this work constrains the parameters of $f(Q)$ gravity and compares it to the $\Lambda$CDM model.....</description>

      <title>Strong lensing cosmography using binary-black-hole mergers: Prospects for the near future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.</description>

      <title>Multiple mountains on a pulsar: implications for gravitational waves and the spin-down rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pulsar, i.e., a spinning neutron star, with a deformation could emit gravitational waves continuously. Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.</description>

      <title>A bigravity model from noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncommutative gravity, based on a twist-deformation of the differential geometry of spacetime and a first-order formulation of the dynamics, requires additional gravitational degrees of freedom as well as an enlargement of the gauge group of Lorentz transformations of the tetrad frame. As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.</description>

      <title>The Missing Massive Sector: Massive Boson Stars -- Stability and GW Emission in Head-on Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous wave function collapse from non-local gravitational self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.</description>

      <title>Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Thermal Casimir Effect in Neutron Star Spacetime via Thermo Field Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in the curved spacetime of a neutron star within the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the spin/anisotropy of the CCOs of Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 and a single surviving continuous gravitational wave candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.</description>

      <title>An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on 3-forms dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-forms are natural candidates for describing the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, as they can inherently reproduce a positive cosmological constant when lacking an evolving potential. When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</description>

      <title>Structural Limitations on Constraining the Time Evolution of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on a time-varying dark energy equation of state are often interpreted as evidence for a dynamical dark energy. In this Letter, we show that such interpretations are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. The mapping from \omega(z) to distances involves successive integrations, which act as an intrinsic low-pass filter in redshift space. As a result, only a small number of slowly varying modes of \omega(z) are observationally accessible, while rapid or localized temporal variations are irretrievably suppressed. This limitation is independent of any specific parametrization and represents a structural property of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker cosmology with distance-based probes.</description>

      <title>FrankenStat I: a New Approach to Pulsar Timing Array Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise.
  In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the "same pulsar, different datasets" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fifth Forces using the Local Distance Ladder: Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant in models where gravity is modified by a fifth force, an additional long-range interaction. In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $&gt;5 \, \sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein-Maxwell gravity in diverse dimensions and construct the small charge perturbation to the extremal rotating black holes with all equal angular momenta in odd $D=2n+1$ dimensions. Exact solutions exist at the next-to-leading order (NLO), and they are analytic, allowing us to obtain the charge corrections to thermodynamic quantities at this order. Irrational exponents in the near-horizon power-series expansion emerge at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We show, by numerical computation, that these horizon geometries can indeed be integrated out to asymptotic Minkowski spacetime, thereby proving the existence of the unusual singular horizon behavior of the extremal charged rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black-hole imaging with a self-consistent electron-temperature prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the cluster algebras for symbol letters or singularities of cosmological correlators in a conformally coupled scalar field theory. We show that the symbol letters for tree-level n-site ladder cosmological correlators are governed by A_{2(n-1)} cluster algebras. Additionally, we demonstrate that the symbol letters for one-loop bubble cosmological correlator are an union of two A_3 cluster algebras. The algebras relations of letters will provide an important tool to bootstrap analytic cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Quantizing non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity with Lagrangian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the quantum version of non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity as a Lagrangian theory with a path integral in the configuration space with an ultra-local in time, but non-local in space, field-dependent measure. Using auxiliary fields, we cast the measure into a local form satisfying several bosonic and fermionic symmetries. We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $\lambda$ in the kinetic term of the metric. We formulate the questions that need to be addressed to prove perturbative renormalizability of the non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact formula for geometric quantum complexity of cosmological perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach offers a powerful framework for quantifying the complexity of unitary transformations. In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators. Despite its conceptual appeal, determining geodesic distances on Lie group manifolds is generally challenging, and existing treatments often rely on perturbative expansions in the structure constants. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity. We focus on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra, relevant for quantum scalar fields evolving on homogeneous and isotropic cosmological backgrounds. The resulting expression for the complexity is applied to de Sitter spacetime as well as to asymptotically static cosmological models undergoing contraction or expansion.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping without master variable and holographic superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pole-skipping is a universal property of Green's functions at strong coupling found by the AdS/CFT duality. There is a conventional formalism of the pole-skipping, but it relies on the existence of a "master variable." Namely, it is applicable to a system with a single field. We propose an alternative formalism that does not rely on a master variable. As an example, we study the pole-skipping of holographic superfluids. A "hydrodynamic" pole such as the diffusion pole is usually regarded as a pole-skipping point. But we point out that not all hydrodynamic poles are pole-skipping points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the analytic structure of thermal spectral function of holographic CFTs, synthesizing recent developments into a set of observations about its asymptotics. Specifically, for a class of scalar primaries with integral dimension, we demonstrate factorization of the exact spectral function into a polynomial piece, which captures the vacuum dynamics, and a non-perturbative piece, which controls its asymptotics. Using exact WKB techniques, we derive a transseries expression for the latter. We use this information to deduce the singular loci of a spatially averaged thermofield double correlator in the complex time plane. Such singularities have been argued to encode information regarding the black hole singularity in the dual spacetime. Our results give a refinement of these statements by capturing the momentum dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational wave-galaxy cross-correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure for the first time the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the cross-correlation of galaxies and gravitational waves (GW), by applying the $\textit{Peak Sirens}$ method. This method consists of finding the peak of the 3D angular cross-spectrum $C_{\ell}(z,D_L)$ between the galaxy redshifts ($z$) and the GW luminosity distances ($D_L$). Using two GW events from the GWTC-3.0 catalog and the GLADE+ galaxy catalog, we make the first detection of the cross-correlation peak at $5.9\sigma$ confidence. This signal comes mostly from the best localized event in the catalog, GW190814, which alone provides a $3.4\sigma$ significance. Adding also the multimessenger event GW170817, but without using its known redshift, we find $H_0 = 67^{+18}_{-15}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and the first observational constraint on the GW bias, $b_{\rm gw} &lt; 4.3$ at 95% CI. These measurements set the stage for future novel cosmological constraints with this technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar, vector and tensor spherical harmonics on three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime are defined and analyzed. Each harmonic defines two sets of asymptotic data on the two sphere in the asymptotic expansion close to both the past and the future of de Sitter spacetime. For each case, we explicit the antipodal relationship of both sets of asymptotic data between past and future infinity, which can be non-local. A procedure is defined to extract these asymptotic data in the presence of sources. This provides for each class of propagating field on de Sitter the relationship between two independent sets of data defined on the sphere in the asymptotic future with the corresponding data defined in the asymptotic past. We also provide several theorems on the decomposition of vector and tensors on de Sitter such as one proving that a large class of tensors obeying an inhomogeneous wave equation can be expressed locally in terms of a symmetric transverse traceless tensor. These results are instrumental in the description of interacting four-dimensional asymptotically flat fields at spatial infinity.</description>

Abstract: We present a discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of non-canonical field theory circumstances, complementing our previous monograph (arXiv:2006.15122) on canonical cases. We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.</description>

      <title>Note on bulk viscosity as an alternative to dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity, which characterizes the irreversible dissipative resistance of a fluid to volume changes, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for explaining both early- and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects.</description>

      <title>A Family of Horizon-penetrating Coordinate Systems for the Schwarzschild Black Hole Geometry with Cauchy Temporal Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.01756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of horizon-penetrating coordinate systems for the Schwarzschild black hole geometry featuring time coordinates that are Cauchy temporal functions for which the level sets are smooth, asymptotically flat, spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces. Coordinate systems of this kind are well suited for the study of the temporal evolution of matter and radiation fields in the joined exterior and interior regions of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, whereas the associated foliations can be employed as initial data sets for the globally hyperbolic development under the Einstein flow. For their construction, we formulate an explicit method that utilizes the geometry of - and structures inherent in - the Penrose diagram of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, thus relying on the corresponding metrical product structure. As an example, we consider an integrated algebraic sigmoid function as the basis for the determination of such a coordinate system. Finally, we generalize our results to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometry up to the Cauchy horizon. The geometric construction procedure presented here can be adapted to yield similar coordinate systems for various other spacetimes with the same metrical product structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of torsion of space-time in the expansion of the Universe as a candidate to dark energy. The analysis is done by reconstructing the torsion function along cosmic evolution by using observational data of Supernovae type Ia, Hubble parameter {and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation} measurements. We have used a kinematic model for the parameterization of the comoving distance and the Hubble parameter, then the free parameters of the models are constrained by observational data. The reconstruction of the torsion function is obtained directly from the data, using the kinematic parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Lense-Thirring Orbital Precession and the Neutron Star Moment of Inertia with Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in models of gravitational waveforms emitted by quasicircular compact binaries in two regimes: the weak-field, post-Newtonian regime, in which the gravitational wave energy flux has now been calculated to fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order (4.5PN) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131}, 121402 (2023)]; and the small-mass-ratio, gravitational self-force regime, in which the flux has now been calculated to second perturbative order in the mass ratio (2SF) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102 (2021)]. We compare these results and find agreement, showing consistency between the two (very distinct though both first-principle) perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ is the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Interestingly, this last method offers notable computational efficiency. However, partner modes do not commute, due to the nontrivial multimode entanglement structure. Hence, a pairwise description will not be suitable for describing the full system. Besides, our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. We checked that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases toward the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. We conclude with a discussion about the possible implementation and observation of our results in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs). These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a parametric study of the spacetime structures obtainable in Weyl conformal gravity's dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution. We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then determine analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the latest DESI data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of observables in FLRW spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a positively curved FLRW spacetime as a background in which a nonrelativistic quantum particle propagates according to the Schroedinger equation. The probability fluid for the corresponding quantum states is taken as a model for the cosmological fluid filling this FLRW Universe. The Hamiltonian operator governing this fictitious particle is proportional to the Laplacian operator derived from the FLRW metric, while the mass of the particle equals the overall matter of the Universe (baryonic and dark). A complete, orthonormal set of quantum eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is obtained. Restricting to radially symmetric states, the latter are then used to compute matrix elements and expectation values of two observables for which quantum operators are identified, namely, the cosmological constant and the gravitational Boltzmann entropy. This entropy is regarded as corresponding to a positively-curved FLRW geometry when the cosmological fluid filling the Universe occupies a given quantum state.</description>

      <title>The images of Brans-Dicke-Kerr type naked singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the images of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with a dimensionless Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$, which belongs to axisymmetric rotating solutions in the Brans-Dicke theory. Our results show that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with the parameter $\omega&gt;-3/2$ represents naked singularities with distinct structures. For the case with $a \leq M$, the shadow in the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime persists, gradually becomes flatter and smaller as $\omega$ decreases. Especially when $\omega&lt;1/2$, the shadow in the image exhibit a very special ``jellyfish" shape and possesses a self-similar fractal structure. For the case with $a &gt; M$, a distinct gray region consisting of two separate patches appears in the image observed by equatorial observers. This indicating that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime can be distinguished from the Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter cases based on its image. These effects of the Brans-Dicke parameter could help us to reveal the intrinsic structure of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetimes and provide a foundation for testing Brans-Dicke theory through future high-precision observations.</description>

      <title>The Infrared Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to horizon degrees of freedom. Although local conservation laws satisfy $\nabla_\mu\langle J^\mu\rangle=0$, transport of baryon number across horizons removes conserved charges from the observer--accessible sector, producing effective depletion in exterior densities. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the reduced exterior continuity equations. We show that relativistic causality forces this compensation to occur through long--wavelength geometric excitations: only infrared modes can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. An infrared return channel thus emerges as a generic feature of horizon--coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot--Carath\'eodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\sigma$ governs both infrared mode excitation and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum characterized by $\sigma$. The same scale modifies large--radius circular motion in a manner consistent with flattened galactic rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $\sigma$ to the cosmic expansion rate, yielding $H\sim\sigma$ and a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large--scale kinematics.</description>

Abstract: The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $\Lambda$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $\Lambda(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $\Lambda$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $\Lambda$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $\Lambda$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited.</description>

Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We argue that special and general theories of relativity implicitly assume spacetime events correspond to quantum measurement outcomes. This leads to a change in how one should view the equivalence of spacetime and gravity. We describe a Bell test using time-like measurements that indicates a non classical causal structure that does not violate no-signaling. From this perspective, the violation of the Bell inequalities are already evidence for the non classical structure of flat spacetime as seen by an agent embedded in it. We argue that spacetime geometry can be learned by an embedded agent with internal actuators and sensors making internal measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory, which have peculiarities due to the nonlinear large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry. Notably, we find that the $S^3 \times S^3$ angular momentum spectrum of BPS states in the Ramond sector exhibits discrete jumps as a function of the ratio between the radii of the two three-spheres. This phenomenon is a quantum gravity effect for which no microscopic derivation is currently known. In addition, we construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetric index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with $AdS_2 \times S^2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spinning Subpopulations of Black Hole Binaries via Iterative Density Estimation</title>

Abstract: Attempts to understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational wave (GW) emission are affected by many unknowns and uncertainties, from both the observational and theoretical (astrophysical modelling) sides. Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\sim\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \gtrsim 40\,M_\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}| \lesssim 0.2$. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating a broader spin distribution at high mass, suggesting a distinct origin for the high-spin systems. We also identify a new potential trend of low-mass BBHs: the \emph{derivative} of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ with respect to $m_1$ ($m_2$) is positive (negative) over the $10$--$15\,M_\odot$ range. This apparent structure may be related to} a previously reported anticorrelation between mass ratio and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

      <title>Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks usually rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in holographic fractonic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, were originally discovered in the study of quantum error-correcting codes in solvable lattice spin models such as Haah's code and the X-cube model. Recently, they have also drawn the attention of the high-energy physics community due to the UV/IR mixing that arises when coarse-graining these lattice models. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode, and a subdiffusive collective mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the latter remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that the subdiffusive mode is inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and is qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a spacelike singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>
