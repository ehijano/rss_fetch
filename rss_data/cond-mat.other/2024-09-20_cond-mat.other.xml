      <title>A universal description of massive point vortices in superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex mass, which is the inertia of a quantum vortex, has never been observed in superfluids and is a long-standing problem in low temperature physics. The impact of the mass is considered negligible in typical experiments with superfluid $^4$He. Recent developments of experimental techniques for manipulating quantum vortices in superfluid atomic gases have enabled us to test this problem more accurately. By introducing universal time and length scales to many-body problems of massive quantum vortices, the theoretical description is formulated in the simplest manner and is universally applicable to different quantum fluids, including fermionic and multicomponent superfluids. There are two branches, the cyclotron and massless branches, for the circular motion of a pair of like-sign vortices. The cyclotron branch can be considered stable as a clear evidence of vortex mass in fermionic superfluids such as superfluid $^3$He-B. The impact of the mass on the massless branch is small but can be enhanced by taking the difference in the two-body dynamics of point vortices with different initial conditions. Our results imply that the vortex mass is a direct cause of the splitting instability of a doubly quantized vortex at absolute zero and that the universal length scale characterizes the final state after the instability. It is also demonstrated that a pair of massive vortices with opposite circulations has a critical distance characterized by the length scale, below which they are spontaneously annihilated without thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of "Classical" Bosons, Fermions, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical mechanics and dynamics of particles that retains some memory of quantum statistics. Our work builds on earlier work on the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of such particles. Starting from the effective classical manifold associated with two-particle bosonic and fermionic coherent states, we show how their exchange statistics is reflected in the symplectic form of the manifold. We demonstrate the classical analogues of exclusion or bunching behavior expected in such states by studying their trajectories in various quadratic potentials. Our examples are two-particle coherent states in one dimension and two-particle vortex motion in the lowest Landau level. We finally compare and contrast our results with previous simulations of the full quantum system, and with existing results on the geometric interpretations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Corner and Edge States in Topological Sierpinski Carpet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in novel ways. Here we present a theoretical study on localized corner and edge states, emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological phase diagram is presented correlating the quadrupole moment with different hopping parameters. Particular localized states are identified following spatial signatures in distinct fractal generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge states which carry on the details of the system's topology. Our findings suggest that fractal lattices may also work as alternative routes to tune energy channels in different devices.</description>
