      <title>Integrating APK Image and Text Data for Enhanced Threat Detection: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach to Android Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As zero-day Android malware attacks grow more sophisticated, recent research highlights the effectiveness of using image-based representations of malware bytecode to detect previously unseen threats. However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems.</description>

      <title>ABE-VVS: Attribute-Based Encrypted Volumetric Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces ABE-VVS, a framework that performs attribute based selective coordinate encryption for point cloud based volumetric video streaming, enabling lightweight yet effective digital rights management (DRM). Rather than encrypting entire point cloud frames, our approach encrypts only selected subsets of coordinates ($X, Y, Z$, or combinations), lowering computational overhead and latency while still producing strong visual distortion that prevents meaningful unauthorized viewing. Our experiments show that encrypting only the $X$ coordinates achieves effective obfuscation while reducing encryption and decryption times by up to 50% and 80%, respectively, compared to full-frame encryption.
  To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a novel end-to-end evaluation of a DRM-enabled secure point cloud streaming system. We deployed a point cloud video streaming setup on the CloudLab testbed and evaluated three HTTP-based Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) granularities - ABE-XYZ (encrypting all $X,Y,Z$ coordinates), ABE-XY, and ABE-X against conventional HTTPS/TLS secure streaming as well as an HTTP-only baseline without any security. Our streaming evaluation demonstrates that ABE-based schemes reduce server-side CPU load by up to 80% and cache CPU load by up to 63%, comparable to HTTP-only, while maintaining similar cache hit rates. Moreover, ABE-XYZ and ABE-XY exhibit lower client-side rebuffering than HTTPS, and ABE-X achieves zero rebuffering comparable to HTTP-only. Although ABE-VVS increases client-side CPU usage, the overhead is not large enough to affect streaming quality and is offset by its broader benefits, including simplified key revocation, elimination of per-client encryption, and reduced server and cache load.</description>

      <title>Proactively Detecting Threats: A Novel Approach Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise security faces escalating threats from sophisticated malware, compounded by expanding digital operations. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) to proactively identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured web-based threat intelligence sources, distinguishing it from reactive malware detection approaches. We developed an automated system that pulls IOCs from 15 web-based threat report sources to evaluate six LLM models (Gemini, Qwen, and Llama variants). Our evaluation of 479 webpages containing 2,658 IOCs (711 IPv4 addresses, 502 IPv6 addresses, 1,445 domains) reveals significant performance variations. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved 0.958 precision and 0.788 specificity for malicious IOC identification, while demonstrating perfect recall (1.0) for actual threats.</description>

      <title>A Decompilation-Driven Framework for Malware Detection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parallel evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced code-understanding capabilities and the increasing sophistication of malware presents a new frontier for cybersecurity research. This paper evaluates the efficacy of state-of-the-art LLMs in classifying executable code as either benign or malicious. We introduce an automated pipeline that first decompiles Windows executable into a C code using Ghidra disassembler and then leverages LLMs to perform the classification. Our evaluation reveals that while standard LLMs show promise, they are not yet robust enough to replace traditional anti-virus software. We demonstrate that a fine-tuned model, trained on curated malware and benign datasets, significantly outperforms its vanilla counterpart. However, the performance of even this specialized model degrades notably when encountering newer malware. This finding demonstrates the critical need for continuous fine-tuning with emerging threats to maintain model effectiveness against the changing coding patterns and behaviors of malicious software.</description>

      <title>StegoStylo: Squelching Stylometric Scrutiny through Steganographic Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.</description>

      <title>Rigorous and Generalized Proof of Security of Bitcoin Protocol with Bounded Network Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof of the security of the Bitcoin protocol is made rigorous, and simplified in certain parts. A computational model in which an adversary can delay transmission of blocks by time $\Delta$ is considered. The protocol is generalized to allow blocks of different scores and a proof within this more general model is presented. An approach used in a previous paper that used random walk theory is shown through a counterexample to be incorrect; an approach involving a punctured block arrival process is shown to remedy this error. Thus, it is proven that with probability one, the Bitcoin protocol will have infinitely many honest blocks so long as the fully-delayed honest mining rate exceeds the adversary mining rate.</description>

      <title>Merged Bitcoin: Proof of Work Blockchains with Multiple Hash Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof of work blockchain protocols using multiple hash types are considered. It is proven that the security region of such a protocol cannot be the AND of a 51\% attack on all the hash types. Nevertheless, a protocol called Merged Bitcoin is introduced, which is the Bitcoin protocol where links between blocks can be formed using multiple different hash types. Closed form bounds on its security region in the $\Delta$-bounded delay network model are proven, and these bounds are compared to simulation results. This protocol is proven to maximize cost of attack in the linear cost-per-hash model. A difficulty adjustment method is introduced, and it is argued that this can partly remedy asymmetric advantages an adversary may gain in hashing power for some hash types, including from algorithmic advances, quantum attacks like Grover's algorithm, or hardware backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>KryptoPilot: An Open-World Knowledge-Augmented LLM Agent for Automated Cryptographic Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions play a central role in modern cybersecurity as a platform for training practitioners and evaluating offensive and defensive techniques derived from real-world vulnerabilities. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances. These results demonstrate the necessity of open-world, fine-grained knowledge augmentation and governed reasoning for scaling LLM-based agents to real-world cryptographic exploitation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Binary Analysis for Vulnerability Detection in x86-64 Machine Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much of the current research in deep learning-based vulnerability detection relies on disassembled binaries, this paper explores the feasibility of extracting features directly from raw x86-64 machine code. Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery.</description>

      <title>Private Links, Public Leaks: Consequences of Frictionless User Experience on the Security and Privacy Posture of SMS-Delivered URLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital service providers often prioritize a frictionless user experience by adopting technologies that simplify access to their services. One widely used mechanism is the Short Message Service (SMS) to deliver links (URLs) that enable single-click access to online services with little to no resistance. However, SMS is inherently insecure, and numerous reports have documented message interception and data leaks. Thus, attributing excessive trust in such an insecure channel opens avenues for unintended access and exploitation by adversaries.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the implications of SMS-delivered URLs from the lens of public SMS gateways. We conduct the study on more than 322K unique SMS-delivered URLs extracted from more than 33 million messages across more than 30K phone numbers, revealing critical security and privacy vulnerabilities. We identify and validate critical Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exposure in 701 endpoints affecting 177 services. Our manual investigation of the root cause of the exposure reveals a weak authentication model which hinges upon tokenized bearer links as sufficient authorization proofs, thereby allowing anyone with the URL to access private user information, including social security number, date of birth, bank account number, and credit score. Additionally, we identify 125 services allowing mass enumeration of valid URLs due to low entropy within tokens, thereby cascading the privacy risks beyond the initially compromised users. Furthermore, we identify mismatches between the GUI and data fetched by the client, extending the scale of privacy leakages. Particularly, we identify 76 services that perform data overfetching. Finally, 18 services have acknowledged and addressed the weaknesses in their services, thereby enhancing the privacy of at least 120M users.</description>

      <title>The Real Menace of Cloning Attacks on SGX Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are gaining popularity as an effective means to provide confidentiality in the cloud. TEEs, such as Intel SGX, suffer from so-called rollback and cloning attacks (often referred to as forking attacks). Rollback attacks are enabled by the lack of freshness guarantees for sealed data; cloning attacks stem from the inability to determine if other instances of an enclave are running on the same platform. While rollback attacks have been extensively studied by the community, cloning attacks have been, unfortunately, less investigated. To address this gap, we extensively study and thoroughly analyze the susceptibility of 72 SGX-based proposals to cloning attacks. Our results show that roughly 20% of the analyzed proposals are insecure against cloning attacks-including those applications that rely on monotonic counters and are, therefore, secure against rollback attacks.</description>

      <title>Explainable Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection in IEC 61850 GOOSE Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.</description>

      <title>SpatialJB: How Text Distribution Art Becomes the "Jailbreak Key" for LLM Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which is a critical barrier to their safe web real-time application. Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. The code for the attack, baseline defenses, and a demo are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpatialJailbreak-8E63.</description>

      <title>CallShield: Secure Caller Authentication over Real-Time Audio Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CallShield, the first caller identity authentication system that operates entirely at the audio layer, without relying on speech transcription, internet connectivity, or trusted infrastructure. CallShield introduces a real-time neural watermarking technique that enables per-bit embedding and recovery within 40-millisecond frames of live 8 kHz speech. This capability allows CallShield to transform the real-time audio channel into a noisy serial communication medium. To ensure reliable data transmission, CallShield implements a low-bitrate data link protocol that provides basic frame synchronization along with error detection, correction, and recovery. For caller authentication, CallShield adopts a secure and lightweight symmetric-key protocol that relies on pairwise shared secrets among trusted contacts. The system completes the full authentication process in an average of 63 seconds, including up to three retransmission attempts, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments under realistic telephony conditions demonstrate that CallShield achieves an overall authentication success rates exceeding 99.2% on clean audio and over 95% under common distortions, aided by selective retransmission of failed messages. Additionally, CallShield maintains high audio quality, achieving PESQ scores above 4.2 and STOI scores above 0.94 on clean speech, and exhibits robustness across a wide range of channel distortions, validating its practical viability for secure, real-time caller authentication.</description>

      <title>Formally Verifying Noir Zero Knowledge Programs with NAVe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems are cryptographic protocols that can (with overwhelming probability) demonstrate that the pair $(X, W)$ is in a relation $R$ without revealing information about the private input $W$. This membership checking is captured by a complex arithmetic circuit: a set of polynomial equations over a finite field. ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation. We evaluate our verifier over 4 distinct sets of Noir programs, demonstrating its practical applicability and identifying a hard-to-check constraint type that charts an improvement path for our verification framework.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Security Analysis for Path-based Traceability Systems in RFID-Enabled Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traceability systems have become prevalent in supply chains because of the rapid development of RFID and IoT technologies. These systems facilitate product recall and mitigate problems such as counterfeiting, tampering, and theft by tracking the manufacturing and distribution life-cycle of a product. Therefore, traceability systems are a defense mechanism against supply chain attacks and, consequently, have become a target for attackers to circumvent. For example, a counterfeiter may change the trace of a fake product for the trace of an authentic product, fooling the system into accepting a counterfeit product as legit and thereby giving a false sense of security.
  This systematic analysis starts with the observation that security requirements in existing traceability solutions are often unstructured or incomplete, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. We synthesized the properties of current state-of-the-art traceability solutions within a single security framework that allows us to analyze and compare their security claims. Using this framework, we objectively compared the security of $17$ traceability solutions and identified several weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This article reports on these flaws, the methodology we used to identify them, and the first security evaluation of traceability solutions on a large scale.</description>

      <title>SoK: Enhancing Cryptographic Collaborative Learning with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative learning (CL), multiple parties jointly train a machine learning model on their private datasets. However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Promptware Kill Chain: How Prompt Injections Gradually Evolved Into a Multi-Step Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as "prompt injection" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation of Arbitrary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to conceal a program's internal structure while preserving its functionality. A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.
  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al. (arxiv:2510.05316), our obfuscation scheme can also be realized in the quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model.</description>

      <title>DP-FEDSOFIM: Differentially Private Federated Stochastic Optimization using Regularized Fisher Information Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.</description>

      <title>Dobrushin Coefficients of Private Mechanisms Beyond Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Dobrushin coefficients of discrete Markov kernels that have bounded pointwise maximal leakage (PML) with respect to all distributions with a minimum probability mass bounded away from zero by a constant $c&gt;0$. This definition recovers local differential privacy (LDP) for $c\to 0$. We derive achievable bounds on contraction in terms of a kernels PML guarantees, and provide mechanism constructions that achieve the presented bounds. Further, we extend the results to general $f$-divergences by an application of Binette's inequality. Our analysis yields tighter bounds for mechanisms satisfying LDP and extends beyond the LDP regime to any discrete kernel.</description>

      <title>SiliconHealth: A Complete Low-Cost Blockchain Healthcare Infrastructure for Resource-Constrained Regions Using Repurposed Bitcoin Mining ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Models Behind Text-to-Image Leaderboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing sophistication of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), the demand for effective detection and mitigation strategies and methods has escalated. Program execution leaves traces in the system audit log, which can be analyzed to detect malicious activities. However, collecting and analyzing large volumes of audit logs over extended periods is challenging, further compounded by insufficient labeling that hinders their usability. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces SAGA (Synthetic Audit log Generation for APT campaigns), a novel approach for generating find-grained labeled synthetic audit logs that mimic real-world system logs while embedding stealthy APT attacks. SAGA generates configurable audit logs for arbitrary duration, blending benign logs from normal operations with malicious logs based on the definitions the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK framework. Malicious audit logs follow an APT lifecycle, incorporating various attack techniques at each stage. These synthetic logs can serve as benchmark datasets for training machine learning models and assessing diverse APT detection methods. To demonstrate the usefulness of synthetic audit logs, we ran established baselines of event-based technique hunting and APT campaign detection using various synthetic audit logs. In addition, we show that a deep learning model trained on synthetic audit logs can detect previously unseen techniques within audit logs.</description>

      <title>StateFi: Effectively Identifying Wi-Fi Devices through State Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized MAC addresses aim to prevent passive device tracking, yet Wi-Fi management frames still leak structured behavioral patterns. Prior work has relied primarily on syntactic probe-request features such as Information Elements (IEs), sequence numbers (SEQ), or RSSI correlations, which degrade in dense environments and fail under aggressive randomization. We introduce StateFi, a fingerprinting framework that models device behavior as finite-state machines (FSMs), capturing both structural transition patterns and temporal execution logic. These FSMs are embedded into compact feature vectors that support efficient similarity computation and supervised classification. Across five heterogeneous campus environments, StateFi achieves 94-97% accuracy for in-network fingerprinting using full management-frame FSMs. With probe-only FSMs, it re-identifies devices under MAC randomization with up to 97% accuracy across large public datasets comprising more than a million frames. When looking at the discrimination accuracy of the model, StateFi reaches 98%, outperforming the strongest prior signature by up to 17 percentage points. These results demonstrate that FSM-level behavioral dynamics form a powerful and largely unmitigated side channel, stable enough to defeat randomization and expressive enough for robust, scalable device identification.</description>

      <title>BeDKD: Backdoor Defense Based on Directional Mapping Module and Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{B}ackdoor d\textbf{e}fense method based on \textbf{D}irectional mapping module and adversarial \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98$\%$ without significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/BeDKD.</description>

      <title>MindGuard: Intrinsic Decision Inspection for Securing LLM Agents Against Metadata Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor.
  Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.</description>

      <title>Secure and Efficient Access Control for Computer-Use Agents via Context Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based computer-use agents represent a convergence of AI and OS capabilities, enabling natural language to control system- and application-level functions. However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues, granting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When agent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible consequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and LLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in usability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for computer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic context and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies, and provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and refining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service, ensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents and contexts. CSAgent supports protecting agents that control computers through diverse interfaces, including API, CLI, and GUI. We implement and evaluate CSAgent, which successfully defends against all attacks in the benchmarks while introducing only 1.99% performance overhead and 5.42% utility decrease.</description>

      <title>zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs orchestrate powerful tools and high-privilege system access, creating a high-stakes attack surface. Prior work on Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) is mainly query-specific, requiring particular user queries as triggers and leading to poor generalizability. We propose query-agnostic IPI, a new attack paradigm that reliably executes malicious payloads under arbitrary user queries. Our key insight is that malicious payloads should leverage the invariant prompt context (i.e., system prompt and tool descriptions) rather than variant user queries. We present QueryIPI, an automated framework that uses tool descriptions as optimizable payloads and refines them via iterative, prompt-based blackbox optimization. QueryIPI leverages system invariants for initial seed generation aligned with agent conventions, and iterative reflection to resolve instruction-following failures and safety refusals. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87% success rate, outperforming the best baseline (50%). Crucially, generated malicious descriptions transfer to real-world coding agents, highlighting a practical security risk.</description>

      <title>Red Teaming Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Bit of a Close Talker: A Practical Guide to Serverless Cloud Co-Location Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud computing by offering users an efficient, cost-effective way to develop and deploy applications without managing infrastructure details. However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and to devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks via normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy, the Double-Dip scheduler, to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Web Payload Classification Using WAMM: An AI-Based Framework for Dataset Refinement and Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web applications increasingly face evasive and polymorphic attack payloads, yet traditional web application firewalls (WAFs) based on static rule sets such as the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) often miss obfuscated or zero-day patterns without extensive manual tuning. This work introduces WAMM, an AI-driven multiclass web attack detection framework designed to reveal the limitations of rule-based systems by reclassifying HTTP requests into OWASP-aligned categories for a specific technology stack. WAMM applies a multi-phase enhancement pipeline to the SR-BH 2020 dataset that includes large-scale deduplication, LLM-guided relabeling, realistic attack data augmentation, and LLM-based filtering, producing three refined datasets. Four machine and deep learning models are evaluated using a unified feature space built from statistical and text-based representations. Results show that using an augmented and LLM-filtered dataset on the same technology stack, XGBoost reaches 99.59% accuracy with microsecond-level inference while deep learning models degrade under noisy augmentation. When tested against OWASP CRS using an unseen augmented dataset, WAMM achieves true positive block rates between 96 and 100% with improvements of up to 86%. These findings expose gaps in widely deployed rule-based defenses and demonstrate that curated training pipelines combined with efficient machine learning models enable a more resilient, real-time approach to web attack detection suitable for production WAF environments.</description>

      <title>VIGIL: Defending LLM Agents Against Tool Stream Injection via Verify-Before-Commit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.</description>

      <title>Burn-After-Use for Preventing Data Leakage through a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture in Enterprise LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs.</description>

      <title>Forward Symbolic Execution for Trustworthy Automation of Binary Code Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control flow in unstructured programs can be complex and dynamic, which makes static analysis difficult. Yet, automated reasoning about unstructured control flow is important when certifying properties of binary (machine) code in trustworthy systems, e.g., cryptographic routines. We present a theory of forward symbolic execution for unstructured programs suitable for use in theorem provers that enables automated verification of both functional and non-functional program properties. The theory's foundation is a set of inference rules where each member corresponds to an operation in a symbolic execution engine. The rules are designed to give control over the tradeoff between the preservation of precision and introduction of overapproximation. We instantiate our theory for BIR, a previously proposed intermediate language for binary analysis. We demonstrate how symbolic executors can be constructed for BIR with common optimizations such as pruning of infeasible symbolic states. We implemented our theory in the HOL4 theorem prover using the HolBA binary analysis library, obtaining machine-checked proofs of soundness of symbolic execution for BIR. We practically evaluated two applications of our theory: verification of functional properties of RISC-V binaries and verification of execution time bounds of programs running on the ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The evaluation shows that such verification can be automated with moderate overhead on medium-sized programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present differentially private (DP) algorithms for bilevel optimization, a problem class that received significant attention lately in various machine learning applications. These are the first algorithms for such problems under standard DP constraints, and are also the first to avoid Hessian computations which are prohibitive in large-scale settings. Under the well-studied setting in which the upper-level is not necessarily convex and the lower-level problem is strongly-convex, our proposed gradient-based $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm returns a point with hypergradient norm at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left((\sqrt{d_\mathrm{up}}/\epsilon n)^{1/2}+(\sqrt{d_\mathrm{low}}/\epsilon n)^{1/3}\right)$ where $n$ is the dataset size, and $d_\mathrm{up}/d_\mathrm{low}$ are the upper/lower level dimensions. Our analysis covers constrained and unconstrained problems alike, accounts for mini-batch gradients, and applies to both empirical and population losses. As an application, we specialize our analysis to derive a simple private rule for tuning a regularization hyperparameter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Secondary Risks of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Distributional Machine Unlearning via Selective Data Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly face requirements to remove entire domains of information--such as toxic language or biases--rather than individual user data. This task presents a dilemma: full removal of the unwanted domain data is computationally expensive, while random partial removal is statistically inefficient. We find that a domain's statistical influence is often concentrated in a small subset of its data samples, suggesting a path between ineffective partial removal and unnecessary complete removal. We formalize this as distributional unlearning: a framework to select a small subset that balances forgetting an unwanted distribution while preserving a desired one. Using Kullback-Leibler divergence constraints, we derive the exact removal-preservation Pareto frontier for Gaussian distributions and prove that models trained on the edited data achieve corresponding log-loss bounds. We propose a distance-based selection algorithm and show it is quadratically more sample-efficient than random removal in the challenging low-divergence regime. Experiments across synthetic, text, and image datasets (Jigsaw, CIFAR-10, SMS spam) show our method requires 15-82% less deletion than full removal for strong unlearning effects, e.g., halving initial forget set accuracy. Ultimately, by showing a small forget set often suffices, our framework lays the foundations for more scalable and rigorous subpopulation unlearning.</description>

      <title>Repairing vulnerabilities without invisible hands. A differentiated replication study on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands" such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth. A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>
