      <title>The Mid-sphere Cousin of the Medial Axis Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medial axis of a smoothly embedded surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of all points for which the Euclidean distance function on the surface has at least two minima. We generalize this notion to the mid-sphere axis, which consists of all points for which the Euclidean distance function has two interchanging saddles that swap their partners in the pairing by persistent homology. It offers a discrete-algebraic multi-scale approach to computing ridge-like structures on the surface. As a proof of concept, an algorithm that computes stair-case approximations of the mid-sphere axis is provided.</description>

      <title>Leibniz rule for wedge product in discrete exterior calculus on general polygonal meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete exterior calculus offers a coordinate-free discretization of exterior calculus especially suited for computations on curved spaces. In this work, we present a wedge product on 2-dimensional pseudomanifolds, whose faces are any polygons. We prove that this polygonal wedge product is compatible with the discrete exterior derivative in the sense that it satisfies the Leibniz product rule. We thus extend previously studied discretizations of wedge products from simplicial or quadrilateral meshes to general polygonal surface meshes. We also prove that our discrete wedge product corresponds to a cup product of cochains on 2-pseudomanifolds.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Three-Dimensional Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three fundamental three-dimensional (3D) geometric packing problems: 3D (Geometric) Bin Packing (3D-BP), 3D Strip Packing (3D-SP), and Minimum Volume Bounding Box (3D-MVBB), where given a set of 3D (rectangular) cuboids, the goal is to find an axis-aligned nonoverlapping packing of all cuboids. In 3D-BP, we need to pack the given cuboids into the minimum number of unit cube bins. In 3D-SP, we need to pack them into a 3D cuboid with a unit square base and minimum height. Finally, in 3D-MVBB, the goal is to pack into a cuboid box of minimum volume.
  It is NP-hard to even decide whether a set of rectangles can be packed into a unit square bin -- giving an (absolute) approximation hardness of 2 for 3D-BP and 3D-SP. The previous best (absolute) approximation for all three problems is by Li and Cheng (SICOMP, 1990), who gave algorithms with approximation ratios of 13, $46/7$, and $46/7+\varepsilon$, respectively, for 3D-BP, 3D-SP, and 3D-MVBB. We provide improved approximation ratios of 6, 6, and $3+\varepsilon$, respectively, for the three problems, for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.
  For 3D-BP, in the asymptotic regime, Bansal, Correa, Kenyon, and Sviridenko (Math.~Oper.~Res., 2006) showed that there is no asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme (APTAS) even when all items have the same height. Caprara (Math.~Oper.~Res., 2008) gave an asymptotic approximation ratio of $T_{\infty}^2 + \varepsilon\approx 2.86$, where $T_{\infty}$ is the well-known Harmonic constant in Bin Packing. We provide an algorithm with an improved asymptotic approximation ratio of $3 T_{\infty}/2 +\varepsilon \approx 2.54$. Further, we show that unlike 3D-BP (and 3D-SP), 3D-MVBB admits an APTAS.</description>
