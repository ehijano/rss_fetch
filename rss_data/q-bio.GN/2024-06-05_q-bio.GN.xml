      <title>GenBench: A Benchmarking Suite for Systematic Evaluation of Genomic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Genomic Foundation Model (GFM) paradigm is expected to facilitate the extraction of generalizable representations from massive genomic data, thereby enabling their application across a spectrum of downstream applications. Despite advancements, a lack of evaluation framework makes it difficult to ensure equitable assessment due to experimental settings, model intricacy, benchmark datasets, and reproducibility challenges. In the absence of standardization, comparative analyses risk becoming biased and unreliable. To surmount this impasse, we introduce GenBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite specifically tailored for evaluating the efficacy of Genomic Foundation Models. GenBench offers a modular and expandable framework that encapsulates a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies. Through systematic evaluations of datasets spanning diverse biological domains with a particular emphasis on both short-range and long-range genomic tasks, firstly including the three most important DNA tasks covering Coding Region, Non-Coding Region, Genome Structure, etc. Moreover, We provide a nuanced analysis of the interplay between model architecture and dataset characteristics on task-specific performance. Our findings reveal an interesting observation: independent of the number of parameters, the discernible difference in preference between the attention-based and convolution-based models on short- and long-range tasks may provide insights into the future design of GFM.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</description>

      <title>Understanding the genetic basis of variation in meiotic recombination: past, present, and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meiotic recombination is a fundamental feature of sexually reproducing species. It is often required for proper chromosome segregation and plays important role in adaptation and the maintenance of genetic diversity. The molecular mechanisms of recombination are remarkably conserved across eukaryotes, yet meiotic genes and proteins show substantial variation in their sequence and function, even between closely related species. Furthermore, the rate and distribution of recombination shows a huge diversity within and between chromosomes, individuals, sexes, populations, and species. This variation has implications for many molecular and evolutionary processes, yet how and why this diversity has evolved is not well understood. A key step in understanding trait evolution is to determine its genetic basis - that is, the number, effect sizes, and distribution of loci underpinning variation. In this perspective, I discuss past and current knowledge on the genetic basis of variation in recombination rate and distribution, explore its evolutionary implications, and present open questions for future research.</description>
