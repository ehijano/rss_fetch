      <title>Singular multipliers on multiscale Zygmund sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an Orlicz space $ L^2 \subseteq X \subseteq L^1$ on $[0,1]$, with submultiplicative Young function ${\mathrm{Y}_X}$, we fully characterize the closed null sets $\Xi$ of the real line with the property that H\"ormander-Mihlin or Marcinkiewicz multiplier operators $\mathrm{T}_m$ with singularities on $\Xi$ obey weak-type endpoint modular bounds on $X$ of the type
  \[
  \left|\left\{x\in \mathbb R : |\mathrm{T}_m f(x)| &gt;\lambda\right\}\right| \leq C \int_{\mathbb R} \mathrm{Y}_X \left(\frac{|f|}{\lambda}\right), \qquad \forall \lambda&gt;0.
  \] These sets $\Xi$ are exactly those enjoying a scale invariant version of Zygmund's $(L\sqrt{\log L},{L^2})$ improving inequality with $X$ in place of the former space, which is termed multiscale Zygmund property. Our methods actually yield sparse and quantitative weighted estimates for the Fourier multipliers $\mathrm{T}_m$ and for the corresponding square functions.
  In particular, our framework covers the case of singular sets $\Xi$ of finite lacunary order and thus leads to modular and quantitative weighted versions of the classical endpoint theorems of Tao and Wright for Marcinkiewicz multipliers. Moreover, we obtain a pointwise sparse bound for the Marcinkiewicz square function answering a recent conjecture of Lerner. On the other hand, examples of non-lacunary sets enjoying the multiscale Zygmund property for each $X=L^p$, $1&lt;p\leq 2$ are also covered.
  The main new ingredient in the proofs is a multi-frequency, multi-scale projection lemma based on Gabor expansion, and possessing independent interest.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves in reaction-diffusion-convection equations with combustion nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence and properties of traveling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion-convection equations on the real line. We consider a general diffusion term involving the $p$-Laplacian and combustion-type reaction term. We extend and generalize the results established for $p=2$ to the case of singular and degenerate diffusion. Our approach allows for non-Lipschitz reaction as well. We also discuss the shape of the traveling wave profile near equilibria, assuming power-type behavior of the reaction and diffusion terms.</description>

      <title>On simultaneous rationality of two Ahmes series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paul Erd\H{o}s asked how rapidly a sequence of positive integers $(n_k)$ can grow if both series $\sum_k 1/n_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(n_k-1)$ have rational sums. In this note we show that there exists an exponentially growing sequence $(n_k)$ with this property. Previous records had polynomial growth, even for easier variants of the problem, regarding the series $\sum_k 1/n_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(n_k-d)$ for any concrete nonzero integer $d$.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity and maximal Garsia entropy for self-similar measures with algebraic contraction ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the self-similar measure $\nu_\lambda=\mathrm{law}\left(\sum_{j \geq 0} \xi_j \lambda^j\right)$ on $\mathbb{R}$, where $|\lambda|&lt;1$ and the $\xi_j \sim \nu$ are independent, identically distributed with respect to a measure $\nu$ finitely supported on $\mathbb{Z}$. One example of this is the classical Bernoulli convolution. It is known that for certain combinations of algebraic $\lambda$ and $\nu$ uniform on an interval, $\nu_\lambda$ is absolutely continuous and its Fourier transform has power decay (\cite{garsia1}, \cite{feng}); in the proof, it is exploited that for these combinations, a quantity called the Garsia entropy $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal.
  We show that absolute continuity and power Fourier decay occur when $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are such that $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal and classify all combinations for which this is the case. We find that if an algebraic $\lambda$ without a Galois conjugate of modulus exactly one has a $\nu$ such that $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal, then all Galois conjugates of $\lambda$ must be smaller in modulus than one and $\nu$ must satisfy a certain finite set of linear equations in terms of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>On Fractional derivative of Hurwitz Zeta function and Jacobi Theta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research paper focuses on exploring two Complex-valued function's fractional derivative, specifically the Hurwitz Zeta function and Jacobi theta function. The study is based on the Complex Generalization of Grunwald-Letnikov Fractional derivative which adheres to the generalized version of the Leibniz rule. Within this paper, we present and establish an identity that serves as a Generalization of the Hurwitz Zeta function's Functional Equation. Additionally, we derive the Jacobi Theta function's Functional Equation, accompanied by a comprehensive examination of the properties associated with the Fractional derivative of these two functions.</description>

      <title>A phase-space approach to weighted Fourier extension inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to expose and investigate natural phase-space formulations of two longstanding problems in the restriction theory of the Fourier transform. These problems, often referred to as the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, assert that Fourier extension operators associated with rather general (codimension 1) submanifolds of euclidean space, may be effectively controlled by the classical X-ray transform via weighted $L^2$ inequalities. Our phase-space formulations, which have their origins in recent work of Dendrinos, Mustata and Vitturi, expose close connections with a conjecture of Flandrin from time-frequency analysis, and rest on the identification of an explicit "geometric" Wigner transform associated with an arbitrary (smooth strictly convex) submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main results are certain natural "Sobolev variants" of the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, and involve estimating the Sobolev norms of such Wigner transforms by geometric forms of classical bilinear fractional integrals. Our broad geometric framework allows us to explore the role of the curvature of the submanifold in these problems, and in particular we obtain bounds that are independent of any lower bound on the curvature; a feature that is uncommon in the wider restriction theory of the Fourier transform. Finally, we provide a further illustration of the effectiveness of our analysis by establishing a form of Flandrin's conjecture in the plane with an $\varepsilon$-loss. While our perspective comes primarily from euclidean harmonic analysis, the procedure used for constructing phase-space representations of extension operators is well-known in optics.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e--Sobolev Inequalities Based on Choquet--Lorentz Integrals with Respect to Hausdorff Contents on Bounded John Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded John domain in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 2$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in (0,n]$. In this article, the authors prove the Poincar\'e and the Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities on Choquet--Lorentz integrals with respect to $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ for all continuously differentiable functions on $\Omega$. These results not only extend the recent Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities, obtained by Harjulehto and Hurri-Syrj\"{a}nen in [J. Funct. Anal. 284 (2023), Paper No. 109862], to the Choquet--Lorentz integrals, but also provide some endpoint estimates (weak type) of their results in the critical case. One of the main novelties exists in that, to achieve the goals, the authors develop some new tools associated with Choquet--Lorentz integrals on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$, such as the fractional Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequality and the Hedberg-type pointwise estimate on the Riesz potential. As an application, the sharp boundedness of the Riesz potential on Choquet--Lorentz integrals is obtained. Moreover, even for classical Lorentz integrals, these Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities are also new.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear lattices from the physics of ecosystems: The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>
