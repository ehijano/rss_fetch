      <title>History Is Not Enough: An Adaptive Dataflow System for Financial Time-Series Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.</description>

      <title>ProbFM: Probabilistic Time Series Foundation Model with Uncertainty Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.</description>

      <title>Controllable Financial Market Generation with Diffusion Guided Meta Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling has transformed many fields, such as language and visual modeling, while its application in financial markets remains under-explored. As the minimal unit within a financial market is an order, order-flow modeling represents a fundamental generative financial task. However, current approaches often yield unsatisfactory fidelity in generating order flow, and their generation lacks controllability, thereby limiting their practical applications. In this paper, we formulate the challenge of controllable financial market generation, and propose a Diffusion Guided Meta Agent (DigMA) model to address it. Specifically, we employ a conditional diffusion model to capture the dynamics of the market state represented by time-evolving distribution parameters of the mid-price return rate and the order arrival rate, and we define a meta agent with financial economic priors to generate orders from the corresponding distributions. Extensive experimental results show that DigMA achieves superior controllability and generation fidelity. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness as a generative environment for downstream high-frequency trading tasks and its computational efficiency.</description>
