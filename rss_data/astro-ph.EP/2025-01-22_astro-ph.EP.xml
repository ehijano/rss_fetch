      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. III. Search for companions to members of young associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute astrometry with Gaia is expected to detect and characterize the orbits of thousands of exoplanets in the coming years. A tool, GaiaPMEX, was recently developed to characterize multiple systems based on Gaia-only data, and, when possible, the Gaia-Hipparcos proper motion anomaly. We compare the detection capabilities of absolute astrometry and spectroscopy (RV), and to detect and characterize planetary-mass companions, combining the astrometric data with direct imaging and RV data. For companion masses possibly in the planetary range, we use direct imaging and when possible, RV data as well, to further constrain their nature and orbital properties.
  For each target, a diagnosis on its binarity based on absolute astrometry is given. When no binary is detected, we provides detection limits in the (sma, mass) space. We identify several companions with possible masses down to the brown dwarfs (BD; 50+) or planetary masses (13). We detect a new giant planet at less than 1-2 au from the M-type star G80-21. For AB Pic and HD 14082 B, we confirm the presence of substellar companions, and provide robust solutions for their mass and orbital properties. We further identify 9 planetary mass companions candidates. Finally, a detailed treatment of noises in Gaia astrometric measurements shows that there are no evidence at a 2-sigma level of two exoplanet detections previously announced.
  Combining GaiaPMEX and RV data is therefore perfectly adaptIn the 0.5 to 5 au domain, GaiaPMEX has an excellent sensitivity to BDs, and a good sensitivity to planetary mass planets for this sample.</description>

      <title>The rapid formation of macromolecules in irradiated ice of protoplanetary disk dust traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic macromolecular matter is the dominant carrier of volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and noble gases in chondrites -- the rocky building blocks from which Earth formed. How this macromolecular substance formed in space is unclear. We show that its formation could be associated with the presence of dust traps, which are prominent mechanisms for forming planetesimals in planet-forming disks. We demonstrate the existence of heavily irradiated zones in dust traps, where small frozen molecules that coat large quantities of microscopic dust grains could be rapidly converted into macromolecular matter by receiving radiation doses of up to several 10s of eV molecule$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$. This allows for the transformation of simple molecules into complex macromolecular matter within several decades. Up to roughly 4$\%$ of the total disk ice reservoir can be processed this way and subsequently incorporated into the protoplanetary disk midplane where planetesimals form. This finding shows that planetesimal formation and the production of organic macromolecular matter, which provides the essential elemental building blocks for life, might be linked.</description>

      <title>Near-circular orbits for planets around M/K-type stars with Earth-like sizes and instellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the discovery of a population of potentially Earth-like planets, yet their orbital eccentricity, which governs their climate and provides clues about their origin and dynamical history, is still largely unconstrained. We identify a sample of 17 transiting exoplanets around late-type stars with similar radii and irradiation to that of Earth and use the "photoeccentric effect" - which exploits transit durations - to infer their eccentricity distribution via hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Our analysis establishes that these worlds further resemble Earth in that their eccentricities are nearly circular (mean eccentricity $=0.060_{-0.028}^{+0.040}$ and $\leq0.15$), with the exception of one outlier of moderate eccentricity. The results hint at a subset population of dynamically warmer Earths, but this requires a larger sample to statistically confirm. The planets in our sample are thus largely subject to minimal eccentricity-induced seasonal variability and are consistent with emerging via smooth disk migration rather than violent planet-planet scattering.</description>

      <title>Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Diurnal and Seasonal variations of Gravity Waves in the lower atmosphere of Mars as observed by Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Gravity Waves (GWs) in the lower atmosphere of Mars based on pressure timeseries acquired by the InSight lander. We compile a climatology showing that most GW activity detected at the InSight landing site takes place after the sunrise and sunset, they are almost absent during the aphelion season, and more prominent around the equinoxes, with variations during dust events and interannual variations. We find GWs with coherent phases in different sols, and a previously unnoticed coincidence of GW activity with those moments in which the diurnal cycle (of tidal origin) exhibits the fastest increases in absolute pressure. We explore the possibility that some of these GWs might actually be high-order harmonics of thermal tides transiently interfering constructively to produce relevant meteorological patterns, and discuss other interpretations based on wind patterns. The so-called Terminator Waves observed on Earth might also explain some of our observations.</description>

      <title>Collisional study of Hilda and quasi-Hilda asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilda asteroids are located in the outer main belt in a stable 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter, while the quasi-Hildas (qH) have similar orbits but are not directly under the effect of the MMR. Moreover, cometary activity has been detected in qH. In this study, we investigate the collisional evolution of Hilda asteroids and apply it to study the cratering on asteroid 334 Chicago, as well as to determine whether impacts between Hildas and qH can serve as a viable mechanism for inducing cometary activity. We simulated the collisional evolution of Hilda asteroids over a period of 4 Gyr. We considered three initial size-frequency distributions (SFD) and two scaling laws for the collisional outcomes and performed a large set of simulations for each scenario which we used to construct median SFDs of the Hilda population. We also derived impactor SFD on asteroid 334 Chicago and used it to calculate the crater SFD on 334 Chicago. Additionally, we evaluated the subcatastrophic impact timescale between Hilda and qH objects. The observed SFD of Hilda asteroids larger than 3 km is best matched by scenarios assuming that such SFD is mostly primordial, implying minimal collisional activity over time. For smaller sizes, although unconstrained, the SFD steepens significantly due to the catastrophic fragmentation of a small number of multikilometer-sized bodies. We determined that the largest impactor on 334 Chicago measures a few kilometers in size, resulting in a maximum crater size of approximately 30 km. Furthermore, the slope of the crater SFD mirrors that of the initial SFD for subkilometric bodies. While impact events between Hildas and qH can induce observable activity and although stochastic in nature, the timescale of such events exceeds the dynamical lifetime of qH, making them an unlikely primary mechanism for inducing observable activity.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. III. Astrophysical implications of second-order and dotriacontapole terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term evolution of selected hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity. We employ analytic equations derived in Paper II for the evolution of orbit-averaged orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits, which include two classes of contributions. One class consists of linear-order contributions, including quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole and dotriacontapole orders, the latter scaling as $\epsilon^6$, where $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. The second class consists of contributions at {\em second} order in the fundamental perturbation parameter; they contribute at orders $\epsilon^{9/2}$, $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$ and $\epsilon^{6}$. For well studied triples such as star-planet systems perturbed by a low-mass third body (``hot Jupiters''), second-order and dotriacontapole (SOD) effects induce only small corrections. For stellar-mass binaries orbiting supermassive black holes, SOD corrections can suppress orbital flips that are generated by purely first-order effects. Planets orbiting binary star systems are susceptible to significant variations in the planetary semimajor axis, an effect that does not occur at first perturbative order. SOD effects in triple black hole systems can induce migrations of the eccentricity to significantly larger values than predicted by first-order perturbations, with implications for the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of the inner binary. We also show that in most cases, evolutions using our SOD equations are in better agreement with those from direct integration of the N-body equations of motion than those from first-order perturbations through hexadecapole order.</description>

      <title>High spectral resolution observations of Uranus' near-IR thermospheric $H_2$ emission spectrum using the IGRINS spectrograph during the 2018 and 2023 apparition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based near-IR observations have revealed that Uranus anomalously hot upper atmosphere, detected by Voyager 2, has been steadily cooling. The observed $H_3^+$ and $H_2$ emission-line spectra probe Uranus' ionosphere and thermosphere, respectively. Previous observations have shown that the cooling has continued well past the 2007 vernal equinox, when the seasonal solar forcing turned positive, resulting in net heating of the IAU northern hemisphere. Most of them, especially for $H_2$, were obtained at moderate spectral resolution, R ~1000 to 3000, which admits more sky background, with its associated noise, per spectral resolution element relative to spectrographs having higher spectral resolution. We report the first instance of high spectral resolution being used to observe Uranus' fundamental-band, rovibrational quadrupole $H_2$ emission spectrum; where the sky background is suppressed and narrow planetary emission lines stand out against the planetary continuum. The IGRINS spectrograph with spectral resolution R ~45,000 was used to observe Uranus in the K-band on Oct 26 &amp; 27, 2018 at the Lowell Discovery Telescope, and on Nov 27, 2023 at Gemini South. These observations reveal rovibrational temperatures of Uranus' thermosphere of 542+/-25 K and 397+/-32 K at these two epochs, respectively. The consecutive-nights at elevated temperature observed at the Discovery Telescope suggest that Uranus' near-IR $H_2$ aurora was detected over each of the northern and southern magnetic poles, respectively. The collective IGRINS results support the continued cooling of Uranus' thermosphere through the 2023 apparition, 73% through the spring season.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of gravitational instability in a 3D gaseous disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical discs which are sufficiently massive and cool are linearly unstable to the formation of axisymmetric structures. In practice, linearly stable discs of surface density slightly below the threshold needed for this instability often form spiral structures, and can subsequently fragment or exhibit a state of self-sustained turbulence, depending on how rapidly the disc cools. This has raised the question of how such turbulence is possible in the linearly stable regime. We suggest a nonlinear mechanism for this phenomenon. We find analytically weakly nonlinear axisymmetric subcritical solitary equilibria which exist in linearly stable 3D discs that are close to the instability threshold. The energy of these 'soliton' solutions is only slightly higher than that of a uniform disc, and the structures themselves are expected to be unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. In this way, these subcritical solitary equilibria highlight a nonlinear instability and provide a possible pathway to a turbulent state in linearly stable discs.</description>

      <title>Where in the Milky Way Do Exoplanets Preferentially Form?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets are detected around stars of different ages and birthplaces within the Galaxy. The aim of this work is to infer the Galactic birth radii ($r_\text{birth}$) of stars and, consequently, their planets, with the ultimate goal of studying the Galactic aspects of exoplanet formation. We used photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data to estimate the stellar ages of two samples of stars hosting planets and, for comparison, a sample of stars without detected planets. The $r_\text{birth}$ of exoplanets were inferred by projecting stars back to their birth positions based on their estimated age and metallicity [Fe/H]. We find that stars hosting planets have higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ compared to stars without detected planets. In particular, stars hosting high-mass planets show higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ than stars hosting low-mass planets. We show that the formation efficiency of planets, calculated as the relative frequency of planetary systems, decreases with the galactocentric distance, which relationship is stronger for high-mass planets than for low-mass planets. Additionally, we find that (i) the formation efficiency of high-mass planets increases with time and encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; (ii) the formation efficiency of low-mass planets shows a slight increase between the ages of 4 and 8 Gyr and also encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; and (iii) stars without detected planets appear to form at larger galactocentric distances over time. We conclude that the formation of exoplanets throughout the Galaxy follows the Galactic chemical evolution, for which our results are in agreement with the observed negative interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient and its enrichment and flattening with time at any radius.</description>

      <title>A One-Dimensional Energy Balance Model Parameterization for the Formation of CO2 Ice on the Surfaces of Eccentric Extrasolar Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric planets may spend a significant portion of their orbits at large distances from their host stars, where low temperatures can cause atmospheric CO2 to condense out onto the surface, similar to the polar ice caps on Mars. The radiative effects on the climates of these planets throughout their orbits would depend on the wavelength-dependent albedo of surface CO2 ice that may accumulate at or near apoastron and vary according to the spectral energy distribution of the host star. To explore these possible effects, we incorporated a CO2 ice-albedo parameterization into a one-dimensional energy balance climate model. With the inclusion of this parameterization, our simulations demonstrated that F-dwarf planets require 29% more orbit-averaged flux to thaw out of global water ice cover compared with simulations that solely use a traditional pure water ice-albedo parameterization. When no eccentricity is assumed, and host stars are varied, F-dwarf planets with higher bond albedos relative to their M-dwarf planet counterparts require 30% more orbit-averaged flux to exit a water snowball state. Additionally, the intense heat experienced at periastron aids eccentric planets in exiting a snowball state with a smaller increase in instellation compared with planets on circular orbits; this enables eccentric planets to exhibit warmer conditions along a broad range of instellation. This study emphasizes the significance of incorporating an albedo parameterization for the formation of CO2 ice into climate models to accurately assess the habitability of eccentric planets, as we show that, even at moderate eccentricities, planets with Earth-like atmospheres can reach surface temperatures cold enough for the condensation of CO2 onto their surfaces, as can planets receiving low amounts of instellation on circular orbits.</description>

      <title>The centimeter emission from planet-forming disks in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the characterization of the (sub-)millimeter emission from planet-forming disks. Instead, the study of the (sub-)centimeter emission has made more limited progress, to the point that only a few exceptional disk-bearing objects have been characterized in the centimeter regime. This work takes a broad view of the centimeter emission from a large sample with VLA observations that is selected from previous ALMA surveys of more representative disks in brightness and extent. We report on the detection and characterization of flux at centimeter wavelengths from 21 sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Complemented by literature and archival data, the entire photometry from 0.85 mm to 6 cm is fitted by a two-component model that determines the ubiquitous presence of free-free emission entangled with the dust emission. The flux density of the free-free emission is found to scale with the accretion rate but is independent of the outer disk morphology depicted by ALMA. The dust emission at 2 cm is still appreciable, and offers the possibility to extract an unprecedented large set of dust spectral indices in the centimeter regime. A pronounced change between the median millimeter indices (2.3) and centimeter indices (2.8) suggests that a large portion of the disk emission is optically thick up to 3 mm. The comparison of both indices and fluxes with the ALMA disk extent indicates that this portion can be as large as 40 au, and suggests that the grain population within this disk region that emits the observed centimeter emission is similar in disks with different size and morphology. All these results await confirmation and dedicated dust modeling once facilities like ngVLA or SKA-mid are able to resolve the centimeter emission from planet-forming disks and disentangle the various components.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE). V. Complete observations, data reduction and analysis, detection performances, and final results</title>

Abstract: During the past decade, state-of-the-art planet-finder instruments like SPHERE@VLT, coupling coronagraphic devices and extreme adaptive optics systems, unveiled, thanks to large surveys, around 20 planetary mass companions at semi-major axis greater than 10 astronomical units. Direct imaging being the only detection technique to be able to probe this outer region of planetary systems, the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE) was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2021 to study the demographics of such young gas giant planets around 400 young nearby solar-type stars. In this paper, we present the observing strategy, the data quality, and the point sources analysis of the full SHINE statistical sample as well as snapSHINE. Both surveys used the SPHERE@VLT instrument with the IRDIS dual band imager in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph IFS and the angular differential imaging observing technique. All SHINE data (650 datasets), corresponding to 400 stars, including the targets of the F150 survey, are processed in a uniform manner with an advanced post-processing algorithm called PACO ASDI. An emphasis is put on the classification and identification of the most promising candidate companions. Compared to the previous early analysis SHINE F150, the use of advanced post-processing techniques significantly improved by one or 2 magnitudes (x3-x6) the contrast detection limits, which will allow us to put even tighter constraints on the radial distribution of young gas giants. This increased sensitivity directly places SHINE as the largest and deepest direct imaging survey ever conducted. We detected and classified more than 3500 physical sources. One additional substellar companion has been confirmed during the second phase of the survey (HIP 74865 B), and several new promising candidate companions are awaiting second epoch confirmations.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of potential exomoon candidates grows, there is a heightened motivation of pursing orbital stability analyses. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation into 4-body systems, consisting of a star, planet, moon, and submoon by using the N-body simulator rebound. Particularly, we focus on the system of Kepler-1625, where evidence of a possible exomoon has been obtained. We investigate the 3-body star--planet--moon system for the proposed exomoon parameters allowing us to identify stable regions associated with most of the space parameters. Thereafter, we consider a 4-body system including a potential submoon. We find that there are both stable and unstable regions, as expected, as well as resonance patterns that are further explored using numerical and analytical methods including secular perturbation theory. We are able to identify these resonances as secular in nature. In addition, we investigate 3-body versions of two other systems, Kepler-1708 and HD 23079, while also studying a 4-body version of HD 23079. Our work may serve as a generalized framework for exploring other planet--moon cases in the future while noting that the current 4-body study may be an incentive for studying further exomoon and submoon systems.</description>

      <title>The doubly librating Plutinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about the 3/2 ratio with Neptune's. We investigate the long term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, $g$, a well-known characteristic of Pluto's orbit. We show that the $g$ librators amongst the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity--inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincar\'e at the end of the 19th century. Approximately sixteen percent of the currently known Plutinos exhibit $g$ librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Scale Physics of a Multi-Species Solar Wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind affects the plasma environment around all solar system bodies. A strong solar wind dynamic pressure pushes plasma boundaries closer to these objects. For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion gyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may act differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important. Protons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the density of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of different solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the induced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer between the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields. Using the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios and analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density (E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary ions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density shows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to downstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger comet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer energy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and the pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in transferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton ratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further downstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass loading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most efficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since different ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual species.</description>

      <title>The TW Hydrae Association is a cluster chain of Sco-Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is a young local association (YLA) about 50 pc from the Sun, offering a unique opportunity to study star and planet formation processes in detail. We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and age, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial velocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them into TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805 members) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\sigma$ Cen, TWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in regions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster chain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's elongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential rotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and will dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings unveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that clusters such as $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were forged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as $\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed differently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\alpha$ Persei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over the past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures emerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky Way. Crucially, their formation in regions with intense stellar feedback may have influenced planet formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. Both the amplitude of initial perturbations and $Pm$ play a critical role in its onset and evolution. It is shown that this dynamo exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, more turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in many astrophysical settings with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry: A case for shorter wavelengths and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI/Paranal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as $\tau$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1$\,\mu$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).</description>

      <title>A Planet Candidate Orbiting near the Hot Jupiter TOI-2818 b Inferred through Transit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-2818 b is a hot Jupiter orbiting a slightly evolved G-type star on a 4.04-day orbit that shows transit timing variations (TTVs) suggestive of a decreasing orbital period. In the most recent year of TESS observations, transits were observed $\sim$8 minutes earlier than expected for a constant period. The implied orbital decay rate is $1.35 \pm 0.25$ s yr$^{-1}$, too fast to be explained by tidal dissipation even considering the evolved nature of the host star. Radial velocity monitoring rules out the possibility that the apparent change in period is due to a steady acceleration of the star by a long-period companion. Apsidal precession due to the tidal distortion of the planet is also physically implausible. The most plausible explanation for the TTVs appears to be gravitational perturbations from a hitherto undetected planet with mass $\lesssim$$10\,M_\oplus$ that is in (or near) a mean-motion resonance with the hot Jupiter. Such a planet could be responsible for the observed TTVs while avoiding detection with the available radial velocity and transit data.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes "dangerous". We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as "red nugget relics", as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).</description>

      <title>CO2-rich protoplanetary discs as a probe of dust radial drift &amp; trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MIR spectra imply considerable chemical diversity in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs: some are H2O-dominated, others by CO2. Sublimating ices from radially drifting dust grains are often invoked to explain some of this diversity, particularly the H2O-rich discs. We use a 1D protoplanetary disc evolution code to model how radially drifting dust grains that transport ices inwards to snowlines impact the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. We explore differences between smooth discs and those where radial drift is impeded by dust trapping outside gas gaps and quantify the effects of gap location and formation time. Discs evolve through an initial H2O-rich phase due to sublimating ices, followed by a CO2-rich phase as H2O vapour advects onto the star and CO2 advects into the inner disc from its snowline. The inclusion of traps hastens the transition between the phases, raising the CO2/H2O ratio; gaps opened early or close-in produce lower increases by blocking more CO2 ice from reaching the inner disc. This leads to a potential correlation between CO2/H2O and gap location that occurs on Myr timescales for fiducial parameters. We produce synthetic spectra from the models which we analyse with 0D LTE slab models to understand how this evolution may be expressed observationally. Whether the evolution can be retrieved depends on the contribution of dust grains to the optical depth: dust that couples to the gas after crossing the H2O snowline can add to the continuum optical depth and obscure the delivered H2O, largely hiding the evolution in its visible column density. However, the CO2/H2O visible column density ratio is only weakly sensitive to dust continuum obscuration. This suggests it may be a clearer tracer of the impact of transport on chemistry than individual column densities for spectra that show weak features probing deep enough in the disc.

      <title>Water Ice in the Edge-On Orion Silhouette Disk 114--426 from JWST NIRCam Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114--426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge-on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3\,$\micron$ -- compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3\,$\micron$ dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to $\sim$0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25 to 5\,$\micron$, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46\,$M_\oplus$ in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paschen $\alpha$ line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk. Examining the morphology of the scattered light lobes reveals that they are laterally offset from each other and exhibit a brightness asymmetry that flips with wavelength -- both evidence for a tilted inner disk in this system.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density ($F_{\text{XUV}}/\rho_p$), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to $0.34 \pm 0.13$ and $0.75 \pm 0.21$ for hydrogen-helium fractions of $0.90$ and $0.99$, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecule kinematics</title>

Abstract: [Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new and unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools for studying the disk pressure structure and estimating fundamental disk parameters, such as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecule approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extracted the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide radial and vertical range. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extended standard methodologies to fit multi-component line profiles. We then sampled the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtained dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$, and scale radius $R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parameterization. Finally, we investigated the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecule approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Linear bending wave propagation in laminar and turbulent discs</title>

Abstract: Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.</description>
