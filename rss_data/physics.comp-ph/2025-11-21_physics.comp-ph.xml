      <title>Implicit and explicit treatments of model error in numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of physical systems invariably suffer from model errors stemming from unmodeled physics, idealizations, and discretization. This article provides a review of techniques developed in the past two decades to approximate and account for these model errors, both implicitly and explicitly. Beginning from fundamental definitions of model-form versus numerical error, we frame model error in inverse problems, data assimilation, and predictive modeling contexts. We then survey major approaches: the Bayesian approximation error framework for implicit error quantification, embedded internal error models for structural uncertainty, probabilistic numerical methods for discretization uncertainty, model discrepancy modeling in Bayesian calibration and its recent extensions, machine-learning-based discrepancy correction, multi-fidelity and hybrid modeling strategies, as well as residual-based, variational, and adjoint-driven error estimators. Throughout, we emphasize conceptual underpinnings of implicit versus explicit error treatment and highlight how these methods improve predictive performance and uncertainty quantification in practical applications ranging from engineering design to Earth-system science. Each section provides an overview of key developments with an extensive list of references to facilitate further reading. The review is written for practitioners of large-scale computational physics and engineering simulation, emphasizing how these methods can be incorporated into PDE solvers, inverse problem workflows, and data assimilation systems.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired momentum-based gradient method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a nonlinear momentum method is introduced to improve the convergence performance of momentum-based gradient optimization algorithms. The method is motivated by the dynamics of non-Newtonian mechanical systems, where conventional momentum schemes can be interpreted as a dynamical model with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. Based on this analogy, a generalized optimization dynamics is constructed by extending the kinetic energy formulation and incorporating a nonlinear damping term. An anharmonic kinetic energy function can be employed to represent the inertial effect of accumulated gradient information during the iterations, while the nonlinear damping mechanism enables a more flexible control of the momentum contribution along the convergence trajectory. Numerical experiments indicate that the method exhibits faster convergence and higher robustness compared to classical momentum algorithms. Moreover, its strong performance on nonconvex objectives makes it particularly suitable for inverse photonic design problems. The results suggest that dynamical systems from physics can provide a view towards the development of efficient optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Neutrino Reconstruction of Single-line Events in the ANTARES Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $\chi^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.</description>

      <title>Geant4 based library SCoRe4 for Surface Contamination and Roughness Effects simulations in rare event search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface simulations are important for accurately modeling particle interactions in experiments where background contributions from surface contaminants can significantly affect detector performance. In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.</description>

      <title>Fourth branch of instability of Stokes' wave and dependence of corresponding growth rate on nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a massive computation we reached the fourth superharmonic instability branch of the Stokes' wave. Using the obtained results we checked phenomenological formulae for the dependence of the instability growth rates corresponding to different branches of instability on the nonlinearity parameter (steepness, defined as the wave swing to wavelength ratio $H/\Lambda$) in the vicinity of the new instability branch appearance and far from it. It is demonstrated, that the formulae, the one obtained as a least squares fit using the information from the first three branches of instability and a phenomenological asymptotics, work for the fourth branch and previously reported branches as well. Range of applicability of the relations was corrected. Growth rates for all four instability branches are reported.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Data-driven Wall Model for Low-speed Flows Part I: Baseline Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose wall model for large-eddy simulation. The model builds on the building-block flow principle, leveraging essential physics from simple flows to train a generalizable model applicable across complex geometries and flow conditions. The model addresses key limitations of traditional equilibrium wall models (EQWM) and improves upon shortcomings of earlier building-block-based approaches. The model comprises four components: (i) a baseline wall model, (ii) an error model, (iii) a classifier, and (iv) a confidence score. The baseline model predicts the wall-shear stress, while the error model estimates epistemic errors and aleatoric errors, both used for uncertainty quantification. In Part I of this work, we present the baseline model, while the remaining three components are introduced in Part II. The baseline model is designed to capture a broad range of flow phenomena, including turbulence over curved walls and zero, adverse, and favorable mean pressure gradients, as well as flow separation and laminar flow. The problem is formulated as a regression task to predict wall shear stress using a neural network. Model inputs are localized in space and dimensionless, with their selection guided by information-theoretic criteria. Training data include, among other cases, a newly generated direct numerical simulation dataset of turbulent boundary layers under favorable and adverse PG conditions. Validation is carried out through both a priori and a posteriori tests. The a priori evaluation spans 140 diverse high-fidelity numerical datasets and experiments (67 training cases included), covering turbulent boundary layers, airfoils, Gaussian bumps, and full aircraft geometries, among others. We demonstrate that the baseline wall model outperforms the EQWM in 90% of test scenarios, while maintaining errors below 20% for 98% of the cases.</description>

      <title>Li-P-S Electrolyte Materials as a Benchmark for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for materials simulations, there is an increasing demand for robust, automated, and chemically insightful benchmarking methodologies. In response, we here introduce LiPS-25, a curated benchmark dataset for a canonical series of solid-state electrolyte materials from the Li2S-P2S5 pseudo-binary compositional line, including crystalline and amorphous configurations. Together with the dataset, we present a suite of performance tests that range from conventional numerical error metrics to physically motivated evaluation tasks. With a focus on graph-based MLIP architectures, we run numerical experiments that assess (i) the effect of hyperparameters and (ii) the fine-tuning behavior of selected pre-trained ("foundational") MLIP models. Beyond the Li-P-S solid-state electrolytes, we expect that such benchmarks and their code implementations can be readily adapted to other material systems.</description>

      <title>Charge-Ordered States and the Phase Diagram of the Extended Hubbard Model on the Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue-accelerated LDOS optimization of high-Q optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new method that yields orders-of-magnitude acceleration in inverse design (e.g. topology optimization) of high-$Q$ resonant cavities to maximize the local density of states (LDOS), and which is also applicable to other resonant-response metrics. The key idea is that, once conventional LDOS optimization has identified a strong resonance, subsequent optimizations can exploit a fast shift-invert eigensolver to ensure that the LDOS remains centered at the resonance peak. We show that this eliminates ill-conditioning at sharp resonances that otherwise dramatically slows LDOS (and similar) optimization for $Q \gg 100$. Our method is demonstrated by design of $Q &gt; 10^6$ resonant cavities in 1d and 2d dielectric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems of multilayered spheres, reviewing the history of the Lorentz-Mie theory and the numerical stability issues encountered in handling multilayered spheres. By combining recursive methods with the transfer matrix method, we propose a modified transfer matrix algorithm designed for the stable and efficient calculation of electromagnetic scattering coefficients of multilayered spheres. The new algorithm simplifies the recursive formulas by introducing Debye potentials and logarithmic derivatives, effectively avoiding numerical overflow issues associated with Bessel functions under large complex variables. Moreover, by adopting a hybrid recursive strategy, this algorithm can resolve the singularity problem associated with logarithmic derivatives in previous algorithms. Numerical test results demonstrate that this algorithm offers superior stability and applicability when dealing with complex cases such as thin shells and strongly absorbing media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ChemGen, a software package that uses code generation to integrate multispecies thermodynamics and chemical kinetics into C+-based computational physics codes. ChemGen aims to make chemical kinetics more accessible in existing simulation frameworks and help bridge the gap between combustion modeling and computational physics. The package employs the concept of decorators which enable flexible C++ code generation to target established software ecosystems. ChemGen generates code to evaluate thermodynamic properties, chemical source terms, and their analytical derivatives for Jacobian calculations. Also included are a variety of implicit time integration schemes, linear solvers, and preconditioners. The various components of Chemgen are verified by demonstrating agreement with Cantera and/or theoretical convergence rates. Finally, we integrate ChemGen into OpenFOAM and achieve a speedup over its native chemistry solver by approximately four times. ChemGen is an ongoing project released under the NRL Open License, a source-available license provided by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>
