      <title>Proposal on the Calculation of the Ionisation-Cluster Size Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. It is able to describe the ionisation-cluster size distributions caused by electrons. It can easily be extented to light ions. In principle, the model has no free parameters. The model especially can be seen as a refinement to B. Grosswendts model. It is shown that it leads to a cluster-size distribution function F2 being more similar to of the yield of double-strand breaks in the DNA than the one calculated by B. Grosswendt. However, the results are still subject to major uncertainties. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Aging following a zero-temperature quench in the $d=3$ Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aging in phase-ordering kinetics of the $d=3$ Ising model following a quench from infinite to zero temperature is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In this model the two-time spin-spin autocorrelator $C_\text{ag}$ is expected to obey dynamical scaling and to follow asymptotically a power-law decay with the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Previous work indicated that the lower Fisher-Huse bound of $\lambda\geq d/2 = 1.5$ is violated in this model. Using much larger systems than previously studied, the instantaneous exponent for $\lambda$ we obtain at late times does \emph{not} disagree with this bound. By conducting systematic fits to the data of $C_\text{ag}$ using different ansaetze for the leading correction term, we find $\lambda = 1.58(14)$ with most of error attributed to the systematic uncertainty regarding the ansaetze. This result is in contrast to the recent report that below the roughening transition universality might be violated.</description>

      <title>Direct stellarator coil design using global optimization: application to a comprehensive exploration of quasi-axisymmetric devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many stellarator coil design problems are plagued by multiple minima, where the locally optimal coil sets can sometimes vary substantially in performance. As a result, solving a coil design problem a single time with a local optimization algorithm is usually insufficient and better optima likely do exist. To address this problem, we propose a global optimization algorithm for the design of stellarator coils and outline how to apply box constraints to the physical positions of the coils. The algorithm has a global exploration phase that searches for interesting regions of design space and is followed by three local optimization algorithms that search in these interesting regions (a ``global-to-local" approach). The first local algorithm (phase I), following the globalization phase, is based on near-axis expansions and finds stellarator coils that optimize for quasisymmetry in the neighborhood of a magnetic axis. The second local algorithm (phase II) takes these coil sets and optimizes them for nested flux surfaces and quasisymmetry on a toroidal volume. The final local algorithm (phase III) polishes these configurations for an accurate approximation of quasisymmetry. Using our global algorithm, we study the trade-off between coil length, aspect ratio, rotational transform, and quality of quasi-axisymmetry. The database of stellarators, which comprises approximately 200,000 coil sets, is available online and is called QUASR, for `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository'.</description>

      <title>An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is widely being used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) due to its ability to provide high-order accurate solutions in complex geometries, capture discontinuities, and exhibit high arithmetic intensity. However, the scalability of DG-based solvers is impeded by communication bottlenecks arising from the data movement and synchronization requirements at extreme scales. To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on the development of asynchronous computing approaches for PDE solvers. Herein, we introduce the asynchronous DG (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing to overcome communication bottlenecks. The ADG method relaxes the need for data communication and synchronization at a mathematical level, allowing processing elements to operate independently regardless of the communication status, thus potentially improving the scalability of solvers. The proposed ADG method ensures flux conservation and effectively addresses challenges arising from asynchrony. To assess its stability, Fourier-mode analysis is employed to examine the dissipation and dispersion behavior of fully-discrete equations that use the DG and ADG schemes along with the Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration scheme. Furthermore, an error analysis within a statistical framework is presented, which demonstrates that the ADG method with standard numerical fluxes achieves at most first-order accuracy. To recover accuracy, we introduce asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the ADG-AT scheme for both linear and nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Simplified algorithm for the Worldvolume HMC and the Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method (WV-HMC method) [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm towards solving the sign problem. Similarly to the tempered Lefschetz thimble method, this method removes the ergodicity problem inherent in algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In addition to this advantage, the WV-HMC method significantly reduces the computational cost because one needs not compute the Jacobian of deformation in generating configurations. A crucial step in this method is the RATTLE algorithm, where the Newton method is used at each molecular dynamics step to project a transported configuration onto a submanifold (worldvolume) in the complex space. In this paper, we simplify the RATTLE algorithm by employing a simplified Newton method (the fixed-point method) along with iterative solvers for orthogonal decompositions of vectors, and show that this algorithm further reduces the computational cost. We also apply this algorithm to the HMC algorithm for the generalized thimble method (GT-HMC method). We perform a numerical test for the convergence of the simplified RATTLE algorithm, and show that the convergence depends on the system size only weakly. The application of this simplified algorithm to various models will be reported in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>
