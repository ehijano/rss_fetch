      <title>Performance Analysis of FAS-Aided NOMA-ISAC: A Backscattering Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-user downlink system for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in which the two users deploy a fluid antenna system (FAS) and adopt the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy. Specifically, the integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) model is considered, where a dual-functional base station (BS) serves to communicate the two users and sense a tag's surrounding. In contrast to conventional ISAC, the backscattering tag reflects the signals transmitted by the BS to the NOMA users and enhances their communication performance. Furthermore, the BS extracts environmental information from the same backscatter signal in the sensing stage. Firstly, we derive closed-form expressions for both the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel at the users utilizing the moment matching method and the Gaussian copula. Then in the communication stage, we obtain closed-form expressions for both the outage probability and for the corresponding asymptotic expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, using numerical integration techniques such as the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature (GLQ), we have series-form expressions for the user ergodic communication rates (ECRs). In addition, we get a closed-form expression for the ergodic sensing rate (ESR) using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Finally, the accuracy of our analytical results is validated numerically, and we confirm the superiority of employing FAS over traditional fixed-position antenna systems in both ISAC and ISABC.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks for Downlink Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum machine learning to optimize the beamforming in a multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink system. We aim to combine the power of quantum neural networks and the success of classical deep neural networks to enhance the learning performance. Specifically, we propose two hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to maximize the sum rate of a downlink system. The first one proposes a quantum neural network employing parameterized quantum circuits that follows a classical convolutional neural network. The classical neural network can be jointly trained with the quantum neural network or pre-trained leading to a fine-tuning transfer learning method. The second one designs a quantum convolutional neural network to better extract features followed by a classical deep neural network. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid neural networks, and reveal that the first method can achieve similar sum rate performance compared to a benchmark classical neural network with significantly less training parameters; while the second method can achieve higher sum rate especially in presence of many users still with less training parameters. The robustness of the proposed methods is verified using both software simulators and hardware emulators considering noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Interpretable Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential surge in traffic data and the pressing need for ultra-low latency in emerging intelligence applications, it is envisioned that 6G networks will demand disruptive communication technologies to foster ubiquitous intelligence and succinctness within the human society. Semantic communication, a novel paradigm, holds the promise of significantly curtailing communication overhead and latency by transmitting only task-relevant information. Despite numerous efforts in both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations of semantic communications, a substantial theory-practice gap complicates the theoretical analysis and interpretation, particularly when employing black-box machine learning techniques. This article initially delves into information-theoretic metrics such as semantic entropy, semantic distortions, and semantic communication rate to characterize the information flow in semantic communications. Subsequently, it provides a guideline for implementing semantic communications to ensure both theoretical interpretability and communication effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Delay-Tolerant Data Harvest Architecture Leveraging Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching all regions of Earth, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can harvest delay-tolerant data from remotely located users on Earth without ground infrastructure. This work aims to assess a data harvest network architecture where users generate data and LEO satellites harvest data from users when passing by. By developing a novel stochastic geometry Cox point process model that simultaneously generates orbits and the motion of LEO satellite harvesters on them, we analyze key performance indices of such a network by deriving the following: (i) the average fraction of time that the typical user is served by LEO satellite harvesters, (ii) the average amount of data uploaded per each satellite pass, (iii) the maximum harvesting capacity of the proposed network model, and (iv) the delay distribution in the proposed network. These key metrics are given as functions of key network variables such as $\lambda$ the mean number of orbits and $\mu$ the mean number of satellites per orbit. Providing rich comprehensive analytical results and practical interpretations of these results, this work assesses the potential of the delay-tolerant use of LEO satellites and also serves as a versatile framework to analyze, design, and optimize delay-tolerant LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Downlink Communications in a Heterogeneous LEO Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks connect millions of devices on Earth and offer various services, such as data communications, remote sensing, and data harvesting. As the number of services increases, LEO satellite networks will continue to grow, and many LEO satellite network operators will share the same spectrum resources. We aim to examine the coexistence of such a future heterogeneous LEO satellite network by proposing a tractable spatial model and analyzing the basic performance of downlink communications. We model a heterogeneous LEO satellite network as Cox point processes, ensuring satellites are located on various orbits. Then, we analyze two different access technologies for such a heterogeneous satellite network: closed access and open access. For both cases, we derive the coverage probability and prove that the coverage probability of the open access scenario outperforms that of the closed access, and this coverage enhancement applies to all users. By providing essential network performance statistics as key distributional parameters and by presenting the fact that the Cox point process approximates a forthcoming future constellation with slight variation, the developed framework and analysis will serve as a tractable instrument to design, evaluate, and optimize heterogeneous LEO satellite networks with numerous constellations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis of RIS-Assisted Cellular Networks with Reflective Intelligent Surfaces on Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provide alternative routes for reflected signals to network users, offering numerous applications. This paper explores an innovative approach of strategically deploying RISs along road areas to leverage various propagation and blockage conditions present in cellular networks with roads. To address the local network geometries shown by such networks, we use a stochastic geometry framework, specifically the Cox point processes, to model the locations of RISs and vehicle users. Then, we define the coverage probability as the chance that either a base station or an RIS is in line of sight (LOS) of the typical user and that the LOS signal has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than a threshold. We derive the coverage probability as a function of key parameters such as RIS density and path loss exponent. We observe that the network geometry highly affects the coverage and that the proposed RIS deployment effectively leverages the underlying difference of attenuation and blockage, significantly increasing the coverage of vehicle users in the network. With experimental results addressing the impact of key variables to network performance, this work serves as a versatile tool for designing, analyzing, and optimizing RIS-assisted cellular networks with many vehicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel decoding method for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Similar to the Belief Propagation (BP)-based QLDPC decoders, the proposed GNN-based QLDPC decoder exploits the sparse graph structure of QLDPC codes and can be implemented as a message-passing decoding algorithm. We compare the proposed GNN-based decoding algorithm against selected classes of both conventional and neural-enhanced QLDPC decoding algorithms across several QLDPC code designs. The simulation results demonstrate excellent performance of GNN-based decoders along with their low complexity compared to competing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers two related learning problems in a federated attack prone setting: federated principal components analysis (PCA) and federated low rank column-wise sensing (LRCS). The node attacks are assumed to be Byzantine which means that the attackers are omniscient and can collude. We introduce a novel provably Byzantine-resilient communication-efficient and sampleefficient algorithm, called Subspace-Median, that solves the PCA problem and is a key part of the solution for the LRCS problem. We also study the most natural Byzantine-resilient solution for federated PCA, a geometric median based modification of the federated power method, and explain why it is not useful. Our second main contribution is a complete alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (altGDmin) algorithm for Byzantine-resilient horizontally federated LRCS and sample and communication complexity guarantees for it. Extensive simulation experiments are used to corroborate our theoretical guarantees. The ideas that we develop for LRCS are easily extendable to other LR recovery problems as well.</description>

      <title>LLMind: Orchestrating AI and IoT with LLM for Complex Task Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented communications are an important element in future intelligent IoT systems. Existing IoT systems, however, are limited in their capacity to handle complex tasks, particularly in their interactions with humans to accomplish these tasks. In this paper, we present LLMind, an LLM-based task-oriented AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices, with humans communicating high-level verbal instructions, to perform complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Study on Sequentiality in Universal Classification with Empirically Observed Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the binary hypothesis testing problem, it is well known that sequentiality in taking samples eradicates the trade-off between two error exponents, yet implementing the optimal test requires the knowledge of the underlying distributions, say $P_0$ and $P_1$. In the scenario where the knowledge of distributions is replaced by empirically observed statistics from the respective distributions, the gain of sequentiality is less understood when subject to universality constraints over all possible $P_0,P_1$. In this work, the gap is mended by a unified study on sequentiality in the universal binary classification problem, where the universality constraints are set on the expected stopping time as well as the type-I error exponent. The type-I error exponent is required to achieve a pre-set distribution-dependent constraint $\lambda(P_0,P_1)$ for all $P_0,P_1$. Under the proposed framework, different sequential setups are investigated so that fair comparisons can be made with the fixed-length counterpart. By viewing these sequential classification problems as special cases of a general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem, the optimal type-II error exponents are characterized. Specifically, in the general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem subject to universality constraints, upper and lower bounds on the type-II error exponent are proved, and a sufficient condition for which the bounds coincide is given. The results for sequential classification problems are then obtained accordingly. With the characterization of the optimal error exponents, the benefit of sequentiality is shown both analytically and numerically by comparing the sequential and the fixed-length cases in representative examples of type-I exponent constraint $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Advanced Channel Coding Designs for Index-Modulated Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of fluid antennas (FAs) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks, achieved by introducing additional degrees of freedom, including reconfigurability and flexibility. In this paper, we investigate the use of index-modulated (IM) transmissions within the framework of FA systems, where an FA position is activated during each transmission interval. This approach is motivated by the common characteristics exhibited by FAs and IM transmissions, which entails the use of a single radio-frequency chain. From this perspective, we derive a closed-form expression for the bit error rate of IM-FAs considering spatial correlation, and demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional IM systems. To enhance the performance of IM-FAs in correlated conditions, channel coding techniques are applied. We first analyze a set partition coding (SPC) scheme for IM-FAs to spatially separate the FA ports, and provide a tight performance bound over correlated channels. Furthermore, the spatial SPC scheme is extended to turbo-coded modulation where the performance is analyzed for low and high signal-to-noise ratios. Our results reveal that through the implementation of channel coding techniques designed for FAs and IM transmission, the performance of coded IM-FAs exhibits notable enhancements, particularly in high correlation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where users take advantage of an emerging fluid antenna system (FAS). More precisely, we consider a scenario where a transmitter is powered by a remote power beacon (PB) to send information to the planar NOMA FAS-equipped users through Rayleigh fading channels. After introducing the distribution of the equivalent channel coefficients to the users, we derive compact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) in order to evaluate the system performance. Additionally, we present asymptotic OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Eventually, results reveal that deploying the FAS with only one activated port in NOMA users can significantly enhance the WPCN performance compared with using traditional antenna systems (TAS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but one does not know the value of the model parameters. Sensing improves the model knowledge and therefore enables better link adaptation. However, we consider a half-duplex scenario where, at each time slot, the communication system must decide between sensing and communication. Thus, we propose to investigate the optimal policy to maximize the expected sum rate given a finite-time communication. We first show that this problem can be modelled in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We then demonstrate that the optimal open-loop and closed-loop policies can be found faster than with the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>

Abstract: To enhance straggler resilience in federated learning (FL) systems, a semi-decentralized approach has been recently proposed, enabling collaboration between clients. Unlike the existing semi-decentralized schemes, which adaptively adjust the collaboration weight according to the network topology, this letter proposes a deterministic coded network that leverages wireless diversity for semi-decentralized FL without requiring prior information about the entire network. Furthermore, the theoretical analyses of the outage and the convergence rate of the proposed scheme are provided. Finally, the superiority of our proposed method over benchmark methods is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations.</description>

However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Near-Field Communications for Next-Generation Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>

      <title>Transforming Time-Varying to Static Channels: The Power of Fluid Antenna Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the mobility problem with the assistance of fluid antenna (FA) on the user equipment (UE) side. We propose a matrix pencil-based moving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying channel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the existing channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method, which is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port prediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that for the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP method may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density of the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper and lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large enough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show that, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than the existing channel prediction method.</description>
