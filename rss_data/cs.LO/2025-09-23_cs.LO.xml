      <title>Compositional Interface Refinement Through Subtyping in Probabilistic Session Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparty session types (MPST) are a robust typing framework that ensures safe and deadlock-free communication within distributed protocols. As these protocols grow in complexity, compositional modelling becomes increasingly important to scalably verify their behaviour. Therefore, we propose using a refinement-based subtyping approach to facilitate the modularity needed for compositional verification. Subtyping in classic MPST systems inherently represents a notion of refinement: A larger type may be safely substituted by a smaller, refined type. The aim of this thesis is to significantly extend this concept and discover just how flexible and expressive subtyping relations can be. We present a probabilistic extension for MPST, the probabilistic mixed choice multiparty session pi-calculus, with a novel, flexible subtyping system which allows one channel (the interface) to be substituted by several channels (the refinement). Our subtyping is remarkably expressive; any selection of well-typed channels as the refinement has a corresponding interface in a single channel type. To facilitate this generality, we base our system on a powerful variant of MPST, mixed choice multiparty session types (MCMP), which offers greater flexibility in communication choices. We establish soundness of the probabilistic mixed choice multiparty session system through several key results. In particular, we prove subject reduction, error-freedom and deadlock-freedom, ensuring that well-typed processes are well-behaved. This work demonstrates subtyping to possess great previously untapped potential for stepwise refinement and compositional verification. The presented framework enables highly expressive, compositional, and verifiable modelling of probabilistic distributed communication.</description>

      <title>parSAT: Parallel Solving of Floating-Point Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfiability-based verification techniques, leveraging modern Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, have demonstrated efficacy in addressing practical problem instances within program analysis.  However, current SMT solver implementations often encounter limitations when addressing non-linear arithmetic problems, particularly those involving floating point (FP) operations. This poses a significant challenge for safety critical applications, where accurate and reliable calculations based on FP numbers and elementary mathematical functions are essential.
  This paper shows how an alternative formulation of the satisfiability problem for FP calculations allows for exploiting parallelism for FP constraint solving. By combining global optimization approaches with parallel execution on modern multi-core CPUs, we construct a portfolio-based semi-decision procedure specifically tailored to handle FP arithmetic. We demonstrate the potential of this approach to complement conventional methods through the evaluation of various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>G\"odel Mirror: A Formal System For Contradiction-Driven Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the G\"odel Mirror, a formal system defined in Lean 4 that treats contradiction as a control signal for recursive structural evolution.
  Inspired by G\"odelian self-reference, our system's operational semantics encode symbolic paradoxes as deterministic transitions. Unlike systems designed to guarantee normalization, the G\"odel Mirror is a minimal and verifiable architecture that leverages a controlled, non-terminating loop as a productive feature.
  Our Lean 4 mechanization proves that self-referential paradoxes are deterministically encapsulated and resolved into new structures without leading to logical explosion, yielding a paraconsistent inference loop: Paradox -&gt; Encapsulate -&gt; Reenter -&gt; Node
  We argue that this calculus opens a new class of symbolic systems in which contradiction is metabolized into structure, providing a formal basis for agents capable of resolving internal inconsistencies.</description>

      <title>Adhesive category theory for graph rewriting in Rocq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a Rocq library about adhesive categories, using Hierarchy Builder (HB). It is built around two hierarchies. The first is for categories, with usual categories at the bottom and adhesive categories at the top, with weaker variants of adhesive categories in between. The second is for morphisms (notably isomorphisms, monomorphisms and regular monomorphisms). Each level of these hierarchies is equipped with several interfaces to define instances. We cover basic categorical concepts such as pullbacks and equalizers, as well as results specific to adhesive categories. Using this library, we formalize two central theorems of categorical graph rewriting theory: the Church-Rosser theorem and the concurrency theorem. We provide several instances, including the category of types, the category of finite types, the category of simple graphs and categories of presheaves. We detail the implementation choices we made and report on the usage of HB for this formalization work.</description>

      <title>The Proof-Theoretic Origin of Double Negation Introduction &amp; Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the proof-theoretic foundations of double negation introduction (DNI) and double negation elimination (DNE) in classical logic. By examining both sequent calculus and natural deduction, it is shown that these rules originate in reductio ad absurdum. The paper demonstrates that both rules possess harmony, ensuring balance between introduction and elimination, and normalisation, which guarantees that derivations reduce to canonical form without detours. These features reveal double negation not as a redundancy, but as a mechanism of proof-theoretic stability, securing the disciplined integration of RAA into classical logic.</description>

      <title>Question Answering with LLMs and Learning from Answer Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding natural language but struggle with explicit commonsense reasoning. A recent trend of research suggests that the combination of LLM with robust symbolic reasoning systems can overcome this problem on story-based question answering tasks. In this setting, existing approaches typically depend on human expertise to manually craft the symbolic component. We argue, however, that this component can also be automatically learned from examples. In this work, we introduce LLM2LAS, a hybrid system that effectively combines the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, the rule induction power of the Learning from Answer Sets (LAS) system ILASP, and the formal reasoning strengths of Answer Set Programming (ASP). LLMs are used to extract semantic structures from text, which ILASP then transforms into interpretable logic rules. These rules allow an ASP solver to perform precise and consistent reasoning, enabling correct answers to previously unseen questions. Empirical results outline the strengths and weaknesses of our automatic approach for learning and reasoning in a story-based question answering benchmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the minimum-size DNF representation has been applied to can in fact be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>

      <title>The STAR-XAI Protocol: An Interactive Framework for Inducing Second-Order Agency in AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit significant limitations in reliability and transparency, often showing a collapse in reasoning capabilities when faced with high-complexity, long-horizon tasks. This "illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue, governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task. The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.00175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a popular formalism to specify temporal patterns with timing constraints over the behavior of cyber-physical systems with application areas ranging in property-based testing, robotics, optimization, and learning. This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools. Results highlight the performance and scalability advantages of our monitoring approach and sequential networks.</description>

      <title>Checking Continuous Stochastic Logic against Quantum Continuous-Time Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying quantum systems has attracted a lot of interest in the last decades.In this paper, we study the quantitative model-checking of quantum continuous-time Markov chains (quantum CTMCs). The branching-time properties of quantum CTMCs are specified by continuous stochastic logic (CSL), which is well-known for verifying real-time systems, including classical CTMCs. The core of checking the CSL formulas lies in tackling multiphase until formulas. We develop an algebraic method using proper projection, matrix exponentiation, and definite integration to symbolically calculate the probability measures of path formulas. Thus the decidability of CSL is established. To be efficient, numerical methods are incorporated to guarantee that the time complexity is polynomial in the encoding size of the input model and linear in the size of the input formula. A running example of Apollonian networks is further provided to demonstrate our method.</description>

Abstract: In [Incer Romeo, I. X., \textit{The Algebra of Contracts}. Ph.D. Thesis, UC Berkeley (2022)] an algebraic perspective on assume-guarantee contracts is proposed. This proposal relies on a construction involving Boolean algebras. However, the structures thus proposed lack a clearly prescribed set of basic operations, necessary if we want to see them as a class of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra). In this article, by prescribing a suitable set of basic operations on contracts, we manage to describe these algebras as (a generating set of members of) well-known varieties.</description>

      <title>Complementing an imperative process algebra with a rely/guarantee logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the relation between imperative process algebra and rely/guarantee logic. An imperative process algebra is complemented by a rely/guarantee logic that can be used to reason about how data change in the course of a process. The imperative process algebra used is the extension of ACP (Algebra of Communicating Processes) that is used earlier in a paper about the relation between imperative process algebra and Hoare logic. A complementing rely/guarantee logic that concerns judgments of partial correctness is treated in detail. The adaptation of this logic to weak and strong total correctness is also addressed. A simple example is given that suggests that a rely/guarantee logic is more suitable as a complementing logic than a Hoare logic if interfering parallel processes are involved.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with omega-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an omega-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of  Buchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.
