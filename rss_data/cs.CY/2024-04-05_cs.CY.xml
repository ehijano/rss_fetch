      <title>Decentralised Moderation for Interoperable Social Networks: A Conversation-based Approach for Pleroma and the Fediverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of decentralised and interoperable social networks (such as the "fediverse") creates new challenges for content moderators. This is because millions of posts generated on one server can easily "spread" to another, even if the recipient server has very different moderation policies. An obvious solution would be to leverage moderation tools to automatically tag (and filter) posts that contravene moderation policies, e.g. related to toxic speech. Recent work has exploited the conversational context of a post to improve this automatic tagging, e.g. using the replies to a post to help classify if it contains toxic speech. This has shown particular potential in environments with large training sets that contain complete conversations. This, however, creates challenges in a decentralised context, as a single conversation may be fragmented across multiple servers. Thus, each server only has a partial view of an entire conversation because conversations are often federated across servers in a non-synchronized fashion. To address this, we propose a decentralised conversation-aware content moderation approach suitable for the fediverse. Our approach employs a graph deep learning model (GraphNLI) trained locally on each server. The model exploits local data to train a model that combines post and conversational information captured through random walks to detect toxicity. We evaluate our approach with data from Pleroma, a major decentralised and interoperable micro-blogging network containing 2 million conversations. Our model effectively detects toxicity on larger instances, exclusively trained using their local post information (0.8837 macro-F1). Our approach has considerable scope to improve moderation in decentralised and interoperable social networks such as Pleroma or Mastodon.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Student Engagement in Large-Scale Capstone Courses: An Experience Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer science (CS) capstone courses offer students a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in software development, practice essential soft skills, and enhance their employability prospects. They are a core component in many CS undergraduate degrees and address the ACM curricula requirements of inculcating professional dispositions in students and making them aware of the broader societal implications of computing. However, coordinating a capstone course, especially for a large student cohort, can be a daunting task for academic staff. It demands considerable time and energy for planning and coordinating activities between students, academic staff, and any external stakeholders. In this experience report, we outline the iterative development and refinement of our capstone course as it grew substantially in size over a span of six consecutive sessions. We outline the pedagogies that helped us to enhance student engagement and motivation in the course as assessed by end-of-course surveys and students' written reflections. We share the lessons that we have learnt and provide recommendations to educators who are designing new capstone courses or looking to scale existing ones.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Advancing Healthcare: Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation model, which is pre-trained on broad data and is able to adapt to a wide range of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It promotes the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models, breaking the contradiction between limited AI models and diverse healthcare practices. Much more widespread healthcare scenarios will benefit from the development of a healthcare foundation model (HFM), improving their advanced intelligent healthcare services. Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the healthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the future. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this survey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the methods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress. Then, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread application of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies emerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the current progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future development in this field. The latest HFM papers and related resources are maintained on our website: https://github.com/YutingHe-list/Awesome-Foundation-Models-for-Advancing-Healthcare.</description>

      <title>GreedLlama: Performance of Financial Value-Aligned Large Language Models in Moral Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ethical implications of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with financial optimization, through the case study of GreedLlama, a model fine-tuned to prioritize economically beneficial outcomes. By comparing GreedLlama's performance in moral reasoning tasks to a base Llama2 model, our results highlight a concerning trend: GreedLlama demonstrates a marked preference for profit over ethical considerations, making morally appropriate decisions at significantly lower rates than the base model in scenarios of both low and high moral ambiguity. In low ambiguity situations, GreedLlama's ethical decisions decreased to 54.4%, compared to the base model's 86.9%, while in high ambiguity contexts, the rate was 47.4% against the base model's 65.1%. These findings emphasize the risks of single-dimensional value alignment in LLMs, underscoring the need for integrating broader ethical values into AI development to ensure decisions are not solely driven by financial incentives. The study calls for a balanced approach to LLM deployment, advocating for the incorporation of ethical considerations in models intended for business applications, particularly in light of the absence of regulatory oversight.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in the Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metaverse promises a shift in the way humans interact with each other, and with their digital and physical environments. The lack of geographical boundaries and travel costs in the metaverse prompts us to ask if the fundamental laws that govern human mobility in the physical world apply. We collected data on avatar movements, along with their network mobility extracted from NFT purchases. We find that despite the absence of commuting costs, an individuals inclination to explore new locations diminishes over time, limiting movement to a small fraction of the metaverse. We also find a lack of correlation between land prices and visitation, a deviation from the patterns characterizing the physical world. Finally, we identify the scaling laws that characterize meta mobility and show that we need to add preferential selection to the existing models to explain quantitative patterns of metaverse mobility. Our ability to predict the characteristics of the emerging meta mobility network implies that the laws governing human mobility are rooted in fundamental patterns of human dynamics, rather than the nature of space and cost of movement.</description>

      <title>Robust Pronoun Use Fidelity with English LLMs: Are they Reasoning, Repeating, or Just Biased?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust, faithful and harm-free pronoun use for individuals is an important goal for language models as their use increases, but prior work tends to study only one or two of these components at a time. To measure progress towards the combined goal, we introduce the task of pronoun use fidelity: given a context introducing a co-referring entity and pronoun, the task is to reuse the correct pronoun later, independent of potential distractors. We present a carefully-designed dataset of over 5 million instances to evaluate pronoun use fidelity in English, and we use it to evaluate 37 popular large language models across architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) and scales (11M-70B parameters). We find that while models can mostly faithfully reuse previously-specified pronouns in the presence of no distractors, they are significantly worse at processing she/her/her, singular they and neopronouns. Additionally, models are not robustly faithful to pronouns, as they are easily distracted. With even one additional sentence containing a distractor pronoun, accuracy drops on average by 34%. With 5 distractor sentences, accuracy drops by 52% for decoder-only models and 13% for encoder-only models. We show that widely-used large language models are still brittle, with large gaps in reasoning and in processing different pronouns in a setting that is very simple for humans, and we encourage researchers in bias and reasoning to bridge them.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation-Based Model Extraction Attack using Private Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the deployment of machine learning (ML) models as services (MLaaS) across diverse production software applications. In parallel, explainable AI (XAI) continues to evolve, addressing the necessity for transparency and trustworthiness in ML models. XAI techniques aim to enhance the transparency of ML models by providing insights, in terms of the model's explanations, into their decision-making process. Simultaneously, some MLaaS platforms now offer explanations alongside the ML prediction outputs. This setup has elevated concerns regarding vulnerabilities in MLaaS, particularly in relation to privacy leakage attacks such as model extraction attacks (MEA). This is due to the fact that explanations can unveil insights about the inner workings of the model which could be exploited by malicious users. In this work, we focus on investigating how model explanations, particularly Generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based counterfactual explanations (CFs), can be exploited for performing MEA within the MLaaS platform. We also delve into assessing the effectiveness of incorporating differential privacy (DP) as a mitigation strategy. To this end, we first propose a novel MEA methodology based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) to enhance the efficiency of extracting a substitute model of a target model exploiting CFs. Then, we advise an approach for training CF generators incorporating DP to generate private CFs. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed KD-based MEA can yield a high-fidelity substitute model with reduced queries with respect to baseline approaches. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the inclusion of a privacy layer impacts the performance of the explainer, the quality of CFs, and results in a reduction in the MEA performance.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating Bias Detection in Language Models: The Role of Implicit Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast datasets, can carry biases that manifest in various forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. One facet of bias is performance disparities in LLMs, often harming underprivileged groups, such as racial minorities. A common approach to quantifying bias is to use template-based bias probes, which explicitly state group membership (e.g. White) and evaluate if the outcome of a task, sentiment analysis for instance, is invariant to the change of group membership (e.g. change White race to Black). This approach is widely used in bias quantification. However, in this work, we find evidence of an unexpectedly overlooked consequence of using template-based probes for LLM bias quantification. We find that in doing so, text examples associated with White ethnicities appear to be classified as exhibiting negative sentiment at elevated rates. We hypothesize that the scenario arises artificially through a mismatch between the pre-training text of LLMs and the templates used to measure bias through reporting bias, unstated norms that imply group membership without explicit statement. Our finding highlights the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in bias quantification</description>

      <title>AI and the Problem of Knowledge Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While artificial intelligence has the potential to process vast amounts of data, generate new insights, and unlock greater productivity, its widespread adoption may entail unforeseen consequences. We identify conditions under which AI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge, can paradoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are trained on vast amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards the 'center' of the distribution. This is generally useful, but widespread reliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we define as "knowledge collapse", and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of human understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose what data they are trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to be worthwhile. To investigate this, we provide a simple model in which a community of learners or innovators choose to use traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and identify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default model, a 20% discount on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3 times further from the truth than when there is no discount. Finally, based on the results, we consider further research directions to counteract such outcomes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Temporal Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of common factual knowledge information. However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model's factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes fairness in automated pedestrian detection, a crucial but under-explored issue in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art deep learning-based pedestrian detectors across demographic groups on large-scale real-world datasets. To enable thorough fairness testing, we provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in 8,311 images with 16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone labels. Our findings reveal significant fairness issues, particularly related to age. The undetected proportions for children are 20.14% higher compared to adults. Furthermore, we explore how various driving scenarios affect the fairness of pedestrian detectors. We find that pedestrian detectors demonstrate significant gender biases during night time, potentially exacerbating the prevalent societal issue of female safety concerns during nighttime out. Moreover, we observe that pedestrian detectors can demonstrate both enhanced fairness and superior performance under specific driving conditions, which challenges the fairness-performance trade-off theory widely acknowledged in the fairness literature. We publicly release the code, data, and results to support future research on fairness in autonomous driving.</description>

Abstract: TikTok is a social media platform that has gained immense popularity over the last few years, particularly among younger demographics, due to the viral trends and challenges shared worldwide. The recent release of a free Research API opens the door to collecting data on posted videos, associated comments, and user activities. Our study focuses on evaluating the reliability of the results returned by the Research API, by collecting and analyzing a random sample of TikTok videos posted in a span of 6 years. Our preliminary results are instrumental for future research that aims to study the platform, highlighting caveats on the geographical distribution of videos and on the global prevalence of viral and conspiratorial hashtags.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nations around the world are conducting research into the design of central bank digital currency (CBDC), a new, digital form of money that would be issued by central banks alongside cash and central bank reserves. Retail CBDC would be used by individuals and businesses as form of money suitable for routine commerce. An important motivating factor in the development of retail CBDC is the decline of the popularity of central bank money for retail purchases and the increasing use of digital money created by the private sector for such purposes. The debate about how retail CBDC would be designed and implemented has led to many proposals, which have sparked considerable debate about business models, regulatory frameworks, and the socio-technical role of money in general. Here, we present a critical analysis of the existing proposals. We examine their motivations and themes, as well as their underlying assumptions. We also offer a reflection of the opportunity that retail CBDC represents and suggest a way forward in furtherance of the public interest.</description>

Abstract: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in our daily life through various applications, services, and products explains the significance of trust/distrust in AI from a user perspective. AI-driven systems (as opposed to other technologies) have ubiquitously diffused in our life not only as some beneficial tools to be used by human agents but also are going to be substitutive agents on our behalf, or manipulative minds that would influence human thought, decision, and agency. Trust/distrust in AI plays the role of a regulator and could significantly control the level of this diffusion, as trust can increase, and distrust may reduce the rate of adoption of AI. Recently, varieties of studies have paid attention to the variant dimension of trust/distrust in AI, and its relevant considerations. In this systematic literature review, after conceptualization of trust in the current AI literature review, we will investigate trust in different types of human-Machine interaction, and its impact on technology acceptance in different domains. In addition to that, we propose a taxonomy of technical (i.e., safety, accuracy, robustness) and non-technical axiological (i.e., ethical, legal, and mixed) trustworthiness metrics, and some trustworthy measurements. Moreover, we examine some major trust-breakers in AI (e.g., autonomy and dignity threat), and trust makers; and propose some future directions and probable solutions for the transition to a trustworthy AI.</description>

      <title>Identifying Climate Targets in National Laws and Policies using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantified policy targets are a fundamental element of climate policy, typically characterised by domain-specific and technical language. Current methods for curating comprehensive views of global climate policy targets entail significant manual effort. At present there are few scalable methods for extracting climate targets from national laws or policies, which limits policymakers' and researchers' ability to (1) assess private and public sector alignment with global goals and (2) inform policy decisions. In this paper we present an approach for extracting mentions of climate targets from national laws and policies. We create an expert-annotated dataset identifying three categories of target ('Net Zero', 'Reduction' and 'Other' (e.g. renewable energy targets)) and train a classifier to reliably identify them in text. We investigate bias and equity impacts related to our model and identify specific years and country names as problematic features. Finally, we investigate the characteristics of the dataset produced by running this classifier on the Climate Policy Radar (CPR) dataset of global national climate laws and policies and UNFCCC submissions, highlighting the potential of automated and scalable data collection for existing climate policy databases and supporting further research. Our work represents a significant upgrade in the accessibility of these key climate policy elements for policymakers and researchers. We publish our model at https://huggingface.co/ClimatePolicyRadar/national-climate-targets and related dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimatePolicyRadar/national-climate-targets.</description>

      <title>Fairness Improvement with Multiple Protected Attributes: How Far Are We?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing research mostly improves the fairness of Machine Learning (ML) software regarding a single protected attribute at a time, but this is unrealistic given that many users have multiple protected attributes. This paper conducts an extensive study of fairness improvement regarding multiple protected attributes, covering 11 state-of-the-art fairness improvement methods. We analyze the effectiveness of these methods with different datasets, metrics, and ML models when considering multiple protected attributes. The results reveal that improving fairness for a single protected attribute can largely decrease fairness regarding unconsidered protected attributes. This decrease is observed in up to 88.3% of scenarios (57.5% on average). More surprisingly, we find little difference in accuracy loss when considering single and multiple protected attributes, indicating that accuracy can be maintained in the multiple-attribute paradigm. However, the effect on F1-score when handling two protected attributes is about twice that of a single attribute. This has important implications for future fairness research: reporting only accuracy as the ML performance metric, which is currently common in the literature, is inadequate.</description>

      <title>AgentGroupChat: An Interactive Group Chat Simulacra For Better Eliciting Emergent Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language significantly influences the formation and evolution of Human emergent behavior, which is crucial in understanding collective intelligence within human societies. Considering that the study of how language affects human behavior needs to put it into the dynamic scenarios in which it is used, we introduce AgentGroupChat in this paper, a simulation that delves into the complex role of language in shaping collective behavior through interactive debate scenarios. Central to this simulation are characters engaging in dynamic conversation interactions. To enable simulation, we introduce the Verbal Strategist Agent, utilizing large language models to enhance interaction strategies by incorporating elements of persona and action. We set four narrative scenarios based on AgentGroupChat to demonstrate the simulation's capacity to mimic complex language use in group dynamics. Evaluations focus on aligning agent behaviors with human expectations and the emergence of collective behaviors within the simulation. Results reveal that emergent behaviors materialize from a confluence of factors: a conducive environment for extensive information exchange, characters with diverse traits, high linguistic comprehension, and strategic adaptability. During discussions on ``the impact of AI on humanity'' in AgentGroupChat simulation, philosophers commonly agreed that ``AI could enhance societal welfare with judicious limitations'' and even come to a conclusion that ``the essence of true intelligence encompasses understanding the necessity to constrain self abilities''. Additionally, in the competitive domain of casting for primary roles in films in AgentGroupChat, certain actors were ready to reduce their remuneration or accept lesser roles, motivated by their deep-seated desire to contribute to the project.</description>
