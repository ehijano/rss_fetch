      <title>Attenuation Bias with Latent Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many political science theories relate to latent variables, but such quantities cannot be observed directly and must instead be estimated from data with inherent uncertainty. In regression models, when a variable is measured with error, its slope coefficient is known to be biased toward zero. We show how measurement error interacts with unique aspects of latent variable estimation, identification restrictions in particular, and demonstrate how common error adjustment strategies can worsen bias. We introduce a method for adjusting coefficients on latent predictors, which reduces bias and typically increases the magnitude of estimated coefficients, often dramatically. We illustrate these dynamics using several different estimation strategies for the latent predictors. Corrected estimates using our proposed method show stronger relationships -- sometimes up to 50% larger -- than those from naive regression. Our findings highlight the importance of considering measurement error in latent predictors and the inadequacy of many commonly used approaches for dealing with this issue.</description>

      <title>Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling of passenger trip assignment in metro networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning passenger trips to specific network paths using automatic fare collection (AFC) data is a fundamental application in urban transit analysis. The task is a difficult inverse problem: the only available information consists of each passenger's total travel time and their origin and destination, while individual passenger path choices and dynamic network costs are unobservable, and behavior varies significantly across space and time. We propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to resolve this problem by jointly estimating dynamic network costs and passenger path choices while quantifying their uncertainty. Our model decomposes trip travel time into four components -- access, in-vehicle, transfer, and egress -- each modeled as a time-varying random walk. To capture heterogeneous passenger behavior, we introduce a multinomial logit model with spatiotemporally varying coefficients. We manage the high dimensionality of these coefficients using kernelized tensor factorization with Gaussian process priors to effectively model complex spatiotemporal correlations. We develop a tailored and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for model inference. A simulation study demonstrates the method's effectiveness in recovering the underlying model parameters. On a large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway, our framework demonstrates superior estimation accuracy over established benchmarks. The results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in passenger preferences and provide robust uncertainty quantification, offering transit operators a powerful tool for enhancing service planning and operational management.</description>

      <title>Mexico 2021: Psychological Intimate Partner Violence Against Women and the Role of Childhood Violence Exposure -- A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, psychological violence was the most prevalent form of intimate partner violence (IPV) suffered by women in Mexico. The consequences of psychological IPV can include low self-esteem, depression, and even potential suicide. It is, therefore, crucial to identify the most relevant risk and protective factors of psychological IPV against women in Mexico. To this end, we adopt an ecological approach and analyze the role of a wide range of factors across four interrelated levels: Individual, relationship, community, and societal. We construct a multidimensional data set with 61,205 observations and 59 variables by integrating nationally representative data from the 2021 Mexican Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships with nine additional sources. For model estimation and factor selection, we combine model-based boosting with stability selection. Our findings reveal that women who were exposed to violence in childhood and whose partners were exposed to violence in childhood face a heightened risk of psychological IPV. These findings highlight the critical yet often overlooked role of childhood violence exposure for psychological IPV risk. Additionally, we confirm the role of three protective factors previously identified by Torres Mungu\'ia and Mart\'inez-Zarzoso (2022) using 2016 data, now validated with 2021 data: women who had their first sex later in life and under consent, who have autonomy in decision-making regarding their professional life and use of economic resources, and who live in a household where housework is done only by male members face a lower risk of suffering psychological IPV.</description>

      <title>An alternative method of adjusting for multiple comparison in medical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Most methods of adjusting for multiplicity focus primarily on controlling type I errors and rarely consider type II errors. We propose a new method that considers controlling for false-positive findings while ensuring sufficient statistical power.
  Methods We proposed a new method for multiple corrections called (Beta-exponential Adjustment, BEA) that considered the statistical power to control for type I errors while also considering the probability of type II errors. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performance characteristic of multiple testing correction procedures. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and power separately for different sample sizes and number of biomarkers and compared them with the Bonferroni, Holm, and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction methods.
  Results The results demonstrated that our proposed BEA correction method exhibited the highest sensitivity at different sample sizes and biomarkers (e.g., sensitivity: BEA 0.8 versus BH 0.62 at sample size at 1000, tested biomarkers at 1000 and positive rate at 30%). With different sample sizes and number of biomarkers, the BEA correction method demonstrated comparable specificity compared with traditional methods. Moreover, we observed that the BEA-corrected had the highest statistical power than other methods, when the outcome was relatively rare.
  Conclusion We proposed the BEA multiple correction method to adjust for multiple comparisons while considering statistical power. The BEA method demonstrated a higher sensitivity, comparable specificity, and higher statistical power, compared with traditional correction methods in different conditions. The BEA correction method can be an alternative of traditional methods of adjusting for multiplicity, especially in studies with small sample size, rare outcomes, or substantial number of biomarkers.</description>

      <title>A comparison of variable selection methods and predictive models for postoperative bowel surgery complications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of postoperative complications can support personalized perioperative care. However, in surgical settings, data collection is often constrained, and identifying which variables to prioritize remains an open question. We analyzed 767 elective bowel surgeries performed under an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol at Medisch Spectrum Twente (Netherlands) between March 2020 and December 2023. Although hundreds of variables were available, most had substantial missingness or near-constant values and were therefore excluded. After data preprocessing, 34 perioperative predictors were selected for further analysis. Surgeries from 2020 to 2022 ($n=580$) formed the development set, and 2023 cases ($n=187$) provided temporal validation. We modeled two binary endpoints: any and serious postoperative complications (Clavien Dindo $\ge$ IIIa). We compared weighted logistic regression, stratified random forests, and Naive Bayes under class imbalance (serious complication rate $\approx$11\%; any complication rate $\approx$35\%). Probabilistic performance was assessed using class-specific Brier scores. We advocate reporting probabilistic risk estimates to guide monitoring based on uncertainty. Random forests yielded better calibration across outcomes. Variable selection modestly improved weighted logistic regression and Naive Bayes but had minimal effect on random forests. Despite single-center data, our findings underscore the value of careful preprocessing and ensemble methods in perioperative risk modeling.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Renal Health Decline Forecasting via Multi-LMM Collaborative Reasoning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.</description>

      <title>Futility Analysis under Scrutiny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of futility analyses in clinical trials when interim analysis population deviates from the target population. We demonstrate how population shifts can distort early stopping decisions and propose post-stratification strategies to mitigate these effects. Simulation studies illustrate the impact of subgroup imbalances and the effectiveness of naive, model-based, and hybrid post-stratification methods. We also introduce a permutation-based screening test for identifying variables contributing to population heterogeneity. Our findings support the integration of post-stratification adjustments using all available baseline data at the interim analysis to enhance the validity and integrity of futility decisions.</description>
