      <title>Breaking traditions: introducing a surrogate Primer Vector in non Keplerian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate trajectories involving multiple impulses within the framework of a generic spacecraft dynamics. Revisiting the age-old query of "How many impulses?", we present novel manipulations heavily leveraging on the properties ofthe state transition matrix. Surprisingly, we are able to rediscover classical results leading to the introduction of a primer vector, albeit not making use of Pontryagin Maximum Principle as in the original developments by Lawden. Furthermore, our mathematical framework exhibits great flexibility and enables the introduction of what we term a "surrogate primer vector" extending a well known concept widely used in mission design. This enhancement allows to derive new simple optimality conditions that provide insights into the possibility to add and/or move multiple impulsive manoeuvres and improve the overall mass budget. This proves especially valuable in scenarios where a baseline trajectory arc is, for example, limited to a single impulse-an instance where traditional primer vector developments become singular and hinder conclusive outcomes. In demonstrating the practical application of the surrogate primer vector, we examine a specific case involving the four-body dynamics of a spacecraft within an Earth-Moon-Sun system. The system is characterized by the high-precision and differentiable VSOP2013 and ELP2000 ephemerides models. The focal point of our investigation is a reference trajectory representing a return from Mars, utilizing the weak stability boundary (WSB) of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. The trajectory incorporates two consecutive lunar flybys to insert the spacecraft into a lunar distant retrograde orbit (DRO). Conventionally, this trajectory necessitates a single maneuver at the DRO injection point.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Continuation of Trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical continuation techniques are powerful tools that have been extensively used to identify particular solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems and enable trajectory design in chaotic astrodynamics problems such as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, the applicability of equilibrium points and periodic orbits may be questionable in real-world applications where the uncertainties of the initial conditions of the spacecraft and dynamical parameters of the problem (e.g., mass ratio parameter) are taken into consideration. Due to uncertain parameters and initial conditions, the spacecraft might not follow the reference periodic orbit owing to growing uncertainties that cause the satellite to deviate from its nominal path. Hence, it is crucial to keep track of the probability of finding the spacecraft in a given region. Building on previous work, we extend numerical continuation to moments of the distribution (i.e., stochastic continuation) by directly continuing moments of the probability density function of the spacecraft state. Only assuming normality of the initial conditions, and leveraging moment-generating functions, Isserlis' theorem, and the algebra of truncated polynomials, we propagate the distribution of the spacecraft state at consecutive surface of section crossings while retaining a symbolic map of the final moments of the distribution that depend on the initial mean and covariance matrix only. The goal of the work is to offer a differential algebra-based general framework to continue 3D periodic orbits in the presence of uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed approach is compared against traditional Monte Carlo simulations to validate the uncertainty propagation approach and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed in terms of uncertainty propagation computational burden and access to higher-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization for Trajectory Design via Invariant Manifolds in the Earth-Moon Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses optimal impulsive trajectory design within the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), presenting a global optimization-based approach to identify minimum $\Delta V$ transfers between periodic orbits, including heteroclinic connections. By combining a Monotonic Basin Hopping (MBH) algorithm with a sequential quadratic solver in a parallel optimization framework, a wide range of minimum $\Delta V$ transfers are efficiently found. To validate this approach, known connections from the literature are reproduced. Consequently, three-dimensional periodic orbits are explored and a systematic search for minimum propellant trajectories is conducted within a selected interval of Jacobi constants and a maximum time of flight. Analysis of the results reveals the presence of very low $\Delta V$ solutions and showcases the algorithm's effectiveness across various mission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Linear Magnetic Holes with Magnetic Mirror Properties in Hybrid Simulations of Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent magnetic field dips whose size ranges from fluid to kinetic scale, ubiquitously observed in the heliosphere and in planetary environments. Despite the longstanding effort in interpreting the abundance of observations, the origin and properties of MHs are still debated. In this letter, we investigate the interplay between plasma turbulence and MHs, using a 2D hybrid simulation initialized with solar wind parameters. We show that fully developed turbulence exhibits localized elongated magnetic depressions, whose properties are consistent with linear MHs frequently encountered in space. The observed MHs develop self-consistently from the initial magnetic field perturbations, by trapping hot ions with large pitch angles. Ion trapping produces an enhanced perpendicular temperature anysotropy that makes MHs stable for hundreds of ion gyroperiods, despite the surrounding turbulence. We introduce a new quantity, based on local magnetic field and ion temperature values, to measure the efficiency of ion trapping, with potential applications to the detection of MHs in satellite measurements. We complement this method by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions inside MHs. Our diagnostics reveal the presence of trapped gyrotropic ion populations, whose velocity distribution is consistent with a loss cone, as expected for the motion of particles inside a magnetic mirror. Our results have potential implications for the theoretical and numerical modelling of MHs.</description>

      <title>Refinement of global coronal and interplanetary magnetic field extrapolations constrained by remote-sensing and in-situ observations at the solar minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar magnetic fields are closely related to various physical phenomena on the sun, which can be extrapolated with different models from photospheric magnetograms. However, the Open Flux Problem (OFP), the underestimation of the magnetic field derived from the extrapolated model, is still unsolved. To minimize the impact of the OFP, we propose three evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate magnetic field models and determine the optimal free parameters in the models by constraining the coronal magnetic fields (CMFs) and the interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) with real observations. Although the OFP still exists, we find that magnetic field lines traced from the coronal models effectively capture the intricate topological configurations observed in the corona, including streamers and plumes. The OFP is lessened by using the HMI synoptic map instead of the GONG daily synoptic maps, and the PFSS+PFCS model instead of the CSSS model. For Carrington Rotation (CR) 2231 at the solar minimum, we suggest that the optimal parameters for the PFSS+PFCS model are $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 2.2-2.5\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{scs}} = 10.5-14.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, as well as for the CSSS model are $R_{\mathrm{cs}} = 2.0 - 2.4\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 11.0 - 14.7\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $a = 1.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$. Despite the IMFs at 1 AU being consistent with the measurements by artificially increasing the polar magnetic fields, the IMFs near the sun are still underestimated. The OFP might be advanced by improving the accuracy of both the weak magnetic fields and polar magnetic fields, especially considering magnetic activities arising from interplanetary physical processes.</description>

      <title>Computing low-thrust transfers in the asteroid belt, a comparison between astrodynamical manipulations and a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers, low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach, utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights, which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different approximation strategies.</description>
