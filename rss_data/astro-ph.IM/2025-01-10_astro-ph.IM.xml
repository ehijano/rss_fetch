      <title>Network and Kinetics-based Biosignatures: Implications for the Putative Habitable World Observatory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory is intended to observe the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets with a resolution greater than that of any previous instrument. While these observations present a substantial opportunity for astrobiology, they also incur the risk of false positives and false negatives. Here, we explore the use of systems science (in the form of network theory and thermochemical kinetics) to mitigate these risks, and briefly describe the technical specifications HWO would require in order to use these methodologies.</description>

      <title>An original classification of obscuration-free telescopes designs unfolded in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose an original classification method for unobscured imaging systems unfolded in two dimensions. This classification is based on a study of off-axis properties, and relies on topology and algorithm of real algebraic geometry to find at least one instance by connected component of a semialgebraic set. Our corresponding nomenclature provides intrinsic information about the system, in terms of geometry and manufacturability. The proposed systems for each name of the nomenclature, can be used as starting points for parallel optimizations, allowing for a much more comprehensive search of an unobscured solution, given a set of specifications. We exemplify our method on three and four mirrors imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Source Structure in Geodetic VLBI on the Visibility Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodetic and astrometric VLBI has entered a new era with the implementation of the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS). These broadband and dual linear polarization observations aim at an accuracy of station coordinates of 1 mm and a reference frame stability of 0.1 mm/year. Although the extended brightness distribution of many of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei observed during geodetic VLBI sessions is resolved by the interferometer, the established processing chain still treats these objects as point sources. We investigate the impact of source structure on the visibility level and develop tools to remove the structure from the visibility data, right after correlation. Here we present our approach and show results obtained from observational VGOS data.</description>

      <title>Parallactic delay for geodetic VLBI and non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia optical astrometric mission has measured the precise positions of millions of objects in the sky, including extragalactic sources also observed by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the recent Gaia EDR3 release, an effect of negative parallax with a magnitude of approximately -17 $\mu$as was reported, presumably due to technical reasons related to the relativistic delay model. A recent analysis of a 30-year set of geodetic VLBI data revealed a similar negative parallax with an amplitude of $-15.8 \pm 0.5$ $ \mu$as. Since both astrometric techniques, optical and radio, provide consistent estimates of this negative parallax, it is necessary to investigate the potential origin of this effect. We developed the extended group relativistic delay model to incorporate the additional parallactic effect for radio sources at distances less than 1 Mpc and found that the apparent annual signal might appear due the non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes, which are defined by the positions of the reference radio sources themselves. Unlike the conventional parallactic ellipse, the apparent annual effect in this case appears as a circular motion for all objects independently of their ecliptic latitude. The measured amplitude of this circular effect is within a range of 10-15 $\mu$as that is consistent with the ICRF3 stability of the fundamental axis. This annual circular effect could also arise if a G\"odel-type cosmological metric were applied, suggesting that, in the future, this phenomenon could be used to indicate global cosmic rotation.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Detecting Solar System objects in Euclid images and classifying them using Kohonen self-organising maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ESA Euclid mission will survey more than 14,000 deg$^2$ of the sky in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, mapping the extra-galactic sky to constrain our cosmological model of the Universe. Although the survey focusses on regions further than 15 deg from the ecliptic, it should allow for the detection of more than about $10^5$ Solar System objects (SSOs). After simulating the expected signal from SSOs in Euclid images acquired with the visible camera (VIS), we describe an automated pipeline developed to detect moving objects with an apparent velocity in the range of 0.1-10 arcsec/h, typically corresponding to sources in the outer Solar System (from Centaurs to Kuiper-belt objects). In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on Sourcextractor software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating moving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters to improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness of the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural network can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify stars, galaxies, and SSOs. By implementing an early-stopping method in the training scheme, we show that the network can be used in a predictive way, allowing one to assign the probability of each detected object being a member of each considered class.</description>

      <title>Detection of binary companions below the diffraction limit with lucky imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a technique for resolving intermediate-separation binaries stars with medium-sized telescopes (i.e. diameter less than or equal to 2.5 m) at wavelengths around 825 nm in the super-resolution range (i.e. below the limit defined by the Rayleigh criterion). We combined two well-known algorithms that have been applied to reduce the halo in lucky imaging observations: COvariancE of Lucky Images (COELI) and the Lucky Imaging Speckle Suppression Algorithm (LISSA). We reviewed the fundamentals of both algorithms and describe a new technique called Lucky Imaging Super resolution Technique (LIST), which is optimized for peak highlighting within the first ring of the Airy pattern. To validate the technique, we carried out several observing campaigns of well-known binary stars with FastCam on the 1.52 m TCS and 2.56 m NOT. The projected angular separation between objects was resolved by applying LIST with a result below 0.15". It can go down to approximately 0.05", given the limitations of the detector plate scale. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that binary companions with such small angular separations have been detected using only lucky imaging at optical wavelengths. The average accuracy achieved for the angular separation measurement is 16 mas with NOT and is 20 mas with TCS. The average accuracy obtained for the position angle measurement is $9.5^o$ for NOT and $11^o$ for TCS. We also made an attempt to measure the relative brightnesses of the binary components, obtaining results that are compatible with literature measurements. Lucky imaging, in combination with speckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of multiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes. However, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime are less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.</description>

      <title>Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy datasets can be challenging to use for high school astronomy classes. Data science education pedagogy can be leveraged to create astronomy activities in which students interrogate data, create visuals, and use statistical thinking to construct astronomy knowledge. This session describes how the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) can provide a web-based interface for students to use basic data science techniques in astronomy to build data literacy while learning astronomical concepts. The activities shared will be available for anyone but were designed to be used in astro 101 classes in high school or early college.</description>

      <title>Coherence DeepClean: Toward autonomous denoising of gravitational-wave detector data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technical and environmental noise in ground-based laser interferometers designed for gravitational-wave observations like Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA, can manifest as narrow (&lt;1Hz) or broadband ($10'$s or even $100'$s of Hz) spectral lines and features in the instruments' strain amplitude spectral density. When the sources of this noise cannot be identified or removed, in cases where there are witness sensors sensitive to this noise source, denoising of the gravitational-wave strain channel can be performed in software, enabling recovery of instrument sensitivity over affected frequency bands. This noise hunting and removal process can be particularly challenging due to the wealth of auxiliary channels monitoring the interferometry and the environment and the non-linear couplings that may be present. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis approach and corresponding cyberinfrastructure to promptly identify and remove noise in software using machine learning techniques. The approach builds on earlier work (referred to as DeepClean) in using machine learning methods for linear and non-linear regression of noise. We demonstrate how this procedure can be operated and optimized in a tandem fashion close to online data taking; it starts off with a coherence monitoring analysis that first singles out and prioritizes witness channels that can then be used by DeepClean. The resulting denoised strain by DeepClean reflects a 1.4\% improvement in the binary neutron star range, which can translate into a 4.3\% increase in the sensitive volume. This cyber infrastructure we refer to as Coherence DeepClean, or CDC, is a significant step toward autonomous operations of noise subtraction for ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) VI: The RACS-high 1655.5 MHz images and catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted a widefield, wideband, snapshot survey using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) referred to as the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). RACS covers $\approx$ 90% of the sky, with multiple observing epochs in three frequency bands sampling the ASKAP frequency range of 700 to 1800 MHz. This paper describes the third major epoch at 1655.5 MHz, RACS-high, and the subsequent imaging and catalogue data release. The RACS-high observations at 1655.5 MHz are otherwise similar to the previously released RACS-mid (at 1367.5 MHz), and were calibrated and imaged with minimal changes. From the 1493 images covering the sky up to declination $\approx$ +48$^\circ$, we present a catalogue of 2 677 509 radio sources. The catalogue is constructed from images with a median root-mean-square noise of $\approx$ 195 $\mu$Jy PSF$^{-1}$ (point-spread function) and a median angular resolution of 11.8" by 8.1". The overall reliability of the catalogue is estimated to be 99.18%, and we find a decrease in reliability as angular resolution improves. We estimate the brightness scale to be accurate to 10%, and the astrometric accuracy to be within $\approx$ 0.6" in right ascension and $\approx$ 0.7" in declination after correction of a systematic declination-dependent offset. All data products from RACS-high, including calibrated visibility datasets, images from individual observations, full-sensitivity mosaics, and the all-sky catalogue are available at the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive.</description>

      <title>Sapphire++: A particle transport code combining a spherical harmonic expansion and the discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sapphire++, an open-source code designed to numerically solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for astrophysical applications. Sapphire++ employs a numerical algorithm based on a spherical harmonic expansion of the distribution function, expressing the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as a system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of the expansion coefficients. The code utilises the discontinuous Galerkin method in conjunction with implicit and explicit time stepping methods to compute these coefficients, providing significant flexibility in its choice of spatial and temporal accuracy. We showcase the code's validity using examples. In particular, we simulate the acceleration of test particles at a parallel shock and compare the results to analytical predictions. The Sapphire++ code (https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp) is available as a free and open-source tool for the community.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping events. For the first time we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events to aid rapid and robust estimation. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Searching for short-timescale radio anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine-learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. Our results show that the UMAP unsupervised machine learning pipeline effectively identifies anomalous signals in high-time-resolution datasets, highlighting its potential for use in future surveys. However, the pipeline is not applicable for standard searches for dispersed single pulses. We classify the detected events and, in particular, we are currently unable to determine the possible origin of events that last multiple seconds. For these we encourage follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Examining Vision Foundation Models for Optical and Radio Astronomy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision foundation models, which have demonstrated significant potential in many multimedia applications, are often underutilized in the natural sciences. This is primarily due to mismatches between the nature of domain-specific scientific data and the typical training data used for foundation models, leading to distribution shifts. Scientific data often differ substantially in structure and characteristics, and researchers frequently face the challenge of optimizing model performance with limited labeled data of only a few hundred or thousand images. This work evaluates the performance of vision foundation models in astrophysics, with a focus on identifying the best practices for adapting them to domain-specific datasets. We aim to establish a framework for selecting, fine-tuning, and optimizing these models for common tasks in optical and radio astronomy. We compared multiple foundation models, including self-supervised, weakly supervised, and distillation-based architectures, across two representative optical and radio datasets. Experiments involved different fine-tuning strategies, projector heads, and data preprocessing techniques, with performance evaluated on classification and detection metrics. Features extracted by specific foundation models improved classification accuracy for optical galaxy images compared to conventional supervised training. Similarly, these models achieved equivalent or superior performance in object detection tasks with radio images. However, classification performance for radio galaxy images was generally poor, often falling short of supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that vision foundation models can be effectively adapted to astrophysical applications, provided practitioners iterate on model selection, training strategies, and data handling.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Bayesian Likelihood Normalisation for CRESST's Background Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using CaWO$_4$ crystals as cryogenic calorimeters, the CRESST experiment searches for nuclear recoils caused by the scattering of potential Dark Matter particles. A reliable identification of a potential signal crucially depends on an accurate background model. In this work we introduce an improved normalisation method for CRESST's model of the electromagnetic backgrounds. Spectral templates, based on Geant4 simulations, are normalised via a Bayesian likelihood fit to experimental background data. Contrary to our previous work, no assumption of partial secular equilibrium is required, which results in a more robust and versatile applicability. Furthermore, considering the correlation between all background components allows us to explain 82.7% of the experimental background within [1 keV, 40 keV], an improvement of 18.6% compared to our previous method.</description>

      <title>Vector Space Integration for Dark Matter Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence Through Dyson Sphere-like structures around Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will be followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as the space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes (PBHs) as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson sphere-like structures around PBHs in the Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>
