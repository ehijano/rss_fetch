      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Demographic effects of aggregation in the presence of a component Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The component Allee effect (AE) is the positive correlation between an organism's fitness component and population density. Depending on the population spatial structure, which determines the interactions between organisms, a component AE might lead to positive density-dependence in the population per capita growth rate and establish a demographic AE. However, existing spatial models impose a fixed population spatial structure, which limits the understanding of how a component AE and spatial dynamics jointly determine the existence of demographic AEs. We introduce a spatially explicit theoretical framework where spatial structure and population dynamics are emergent properties of the individual-level demographic and movement rates. This framework predicts various spatial patterns depending on its specific parameterization, including evenly spaced aggregates of organisms, that determine the demographic-level by-products of the component AE. We find that aggregation increases population abundance and allows population survival in harsher environments and at lower global population densities when compared with uniformly distributed organisms. Moreover, aggregation can prevent the component AE from manifesting at the population level or restrict it to the level of each independent aggregate. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how component AEs might operate for different spatial structures and manifest at larger scales.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay the mathematical foundations of the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and physical contact forces. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>
