      <title>Polychromatic Coloring of Tuples in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph $H$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of hyperedges that are subsets of $V$. A $t$-tuple of $H$ is a subset of $t$ vertices of $V$. A $t$-tuple $k$-coloring of $H$ is a mapping of its $t$-tuples into $k$ colors. A coloring is called $(t,k,f)$-polychromatic if each hyperedge of $E$ that has at least $f$ vertices contains tuples of all the $k$ colors. Let $f_H(t,k)$ be the minimum $f$ such that $H$ has a $(t,k,f)$-polychromatic coloring. For a family of hypergraphs $\cal{H}$ let $f_{\cal{H}}(t,k)$ be the maximum $f_H(t,k)$ over all hypergraphs $H$ in $\cal{H}$. We present several bounds on $f_{\cal{H}}(t,k)$ for $t\ge 2$.
  - Let $\cal{H}$ be the family of hypergraphs $H$ that is obtained by taking any set $P$ of points in $\Re^2$, setting $V:=P$ and $E:=\{d\cap P\colon d\text{ is a disk in }\Re^2\}$. We prove that $f_\cal{H}(2,k)\le 3.7^k$, that is, the pairs of points (2-tuples) can be $k$-colored such that any disk containing at least $3.7^k$ points has pairs of all colors.
  - For the family $\mathcal{H}$ of shrinkable hypergraphs of VC-dimension at most $d$ we prove that $ f_\cal{H}(d{+}1,k) \leq c^k$ for some constant $c=c(d)$. We also prove that every hypergraph with $n$ vertices and with VC-dimension at most $d$ has a $(d{+}1)$-tuple $T$ of depth at least $\frac{n}{c}$, i.e., any hyperedge that contains $T$ also contains $\frac{n}{c}$ other vertices.
  - For the relationship between $t$-tuple coloring and vertex coloring in any hypergraph $H$ we establish the inequality $\frac{1}{e}\cdot tk^{\frac{1}{t}}\le f_H(t,k)\le f_H(1,tk^{\frac{1}{t}})$. For the special case of $k=2$, we prove that $t+1\le f_H(t,2)\le\max\{f_H(1,2), t+1\}$; this improves upon the previous best known upper bound.
  - We generalize some of our results to higher dimensions, other shapes, pseudo-disks, and also study the relationship between tuple coloring and epsilon nets.</description>

      <title>When alpha-complexes collapse onto codimension-1 submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set of points $P$ sampling an unknown smooth surface $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$, our goal is to triangulate $\mathcal{M}$ based solely on $P$. Assuming $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth orientable submanifold of codimension 1 in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we introduce a simple algorithm, Naive Squash, which simplifies the $\alpha$-complex of $P$ by repeatedly applying a new type of collapse called vertical relative to $\mathcal{M}$. Naive Squash also has a practical version that does not require knowledge of $\mathcal{M}$. We establish conditions under which both the naive and practical Squash algorithms output a triangulation of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a bound on the angle formed by triangles in the $\alpha$-complex with $\mathcal{M}$, yielding sampling conditions on $P$ that are competitive with existing literature for smooth surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, while offering a more compartmentalized proof. As a by-product, we obtain that the restricted Delaunay complex of $P$ triangulates $\mathcal{M}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under weaker conditions than existing ones.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Topological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distance function to a compact set plays a crucial role in the paradigm of topological data analysis. In particular, the sublevel sets of the distance function are used in the computation of persistent homology -- a backbone of the topological data analysis pipeline. Despite its stability to perturbations in the Hausdorff distance, persistent homology is highly sensitive to outliers. In this work, we develop a framework of statistical inference for persistent homology in the presence of outliers. Drawing inspiration from recent developments in robust statistics, we propose a \textit{median-of-means} variant of the distance function (\textsf{MoM Dist}) and establish its statistical properties. In particular, we show that, even in the presence of outliers, the sublevel filtrations and weighted filtrations induced by \textsf{MoM Dist} are both consistent estimators of the true underlying population counterpart and exhibit near minimax-optimal performance in adversarial settings. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology through simulations and applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Locality Sensitive Orderings in Doubling Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their pioneering work, Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones (SICOMP 2020) introduced locality-sensitive ordering (LSO), and constructed an LSO with a constant number of orderings for point sets in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Furthermore, their LSO could be made dynamic effortlessly under point insertions and deletions, taking $O(\log{n})$ time per update by exploiting Euclidean geometry. Their LSO provides a powerful primitive to solve a host of geometric problems in both dynamic and static settings. Filtser and Le (STOC 2022) constructed the first LSO with a constant number of orderings in the more general setting of doubling metrics. However, their algorithm is inherently static since it relies on several sophisticated constructions in intermediate steps, none of which is known to have a dynamic version. Making their LSO dynamic would recover the full generality of LSO and provide a general tool to dynamize a vast number of static constructions in doubling metrics.
  In this work, we give a dynamic algorithm that has $O(\log{n})$ time per update to construct an LSO in doubling metrics under point insertions and deletions. We introduce a toolkit of several new data structures: a pairwise tree cover, a net tree cover, and a leaf tracker. A key technical is stabilizing the dynamic net tree of Cole and Gottlieb (STOC 2006), a central dynamic data structure in doubling metrics. Specifically, we show that every update to the dynamic net tree can be decomposed into a few simple updates to trees in the net tree cover. As stability is the key to any dynamic algorithm, our technique could be useful for other problems in doubling metrics.
  We obtain several algorithmic applications from our dynamic LSO. The most notably is the first dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $k$-fault tolerant spanner in doubling metrics with optimal sparsity in optimal $O(\log{n})$ time per update.</description>

      <title>Query-Efficient Fixpoints of $\ell_p$-Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an $\epsilon$-approximate fixpoint of a map $f:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]^d$ can be found with $\mathcal{O}(d^2(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon} + \log\frac{1}{1-\lambda}))$ queries to $f$ if $f$ is $\lambda$-contracting with respect to an $\ell_p$-metric for some $p\in [1,\infty)\cup\{\infty\}$. This generalizes a recent result of Chen, Li, and Yannakakis [STOC'24] from the $\ell_\infty$-case to all $\ell_p$-metrics. Previously, all query upper bounds for $p\in [1,\infty) \setminus \{2\}$ were either exponential in $d$, $\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, or $\log\frac{1}{1-\lambda}$.
  Chen, Li, and Yannakakis also show how to ensure that all queries to $f$ lie on a discrete grid of limited granularity in the $\ell_\infty$-case. We provide such a rounding for the $\ell_1$-case, placing an appropriately defined version of the $\ell_1$-case in $\textsf{FP}^{dt}$.
  To prove our results, we introduce the notion of $\ell_p$-halfspaces and generalize the classical centerpoint theorem from discrete geometry: for any $p \in [1, \infty) \cup \{\infty\}$ and any mass distribution (or point set), we prove that there exists a centerpoint $c$ such that every $\ell_p$-halfspace defined by $c$ and a normal vector contains at least a $\frac{1}{d+1}$-fraction of the mass (or points).</description>
